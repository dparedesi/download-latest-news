We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.

Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

When Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu ended the costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa's most populous country, Ahmed Halilu knew his e-hailing cab business in the capital, Abuja, was about to run into huge losses. Transportation costs skyrocketed as the price of petrol more than tripled in the months that followed last year's decision, resulting in the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. In what they said would eventually lower transportation costs by almost 50%, Nigerian authorities in August introduced a compressed natural gas (CNG) initiative to tap its huge gas reserves — Africa’s largest — and roll out CNG buses while switching petrol-powered vehicles to use it. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. As the stock market has moved higher, one victim has been dividend yields. With the average payout for the S&P 500 down to just 1.25%, such stocks have lost a bit of appeal at a time when investors can earn a guaranteed return of around 5% in some certificates of deposit. Admittedly, AT&T's (NYSE: T) recent dividend history may make its stock a strange choice at first glance.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity.

Title: Commentary: Stealth firing or ethical dismissal? Why employers terminate staff for minor offences
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/stealth-firing-retrenchment-layoff-worker-employee-conduct-offence-4764586
Time Published: 2024-11-23T22:00:00Z

Commentary Enforcing a hard line on employee conduct could prevent bigger lapses but may prompt claims of disguised cost savings, says Anjli Raval for the Financial Times. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. (Photo: iStock) LONDON: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy recently told employees that a new plan requiring them to be in the office five days a week did not amount to a “backdoor layoff”. Yet his reported comments at a company-wide meeting last week did not rebut a previous suggestion from a senior manager that staff who fail to comply could look for work elsewhere. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. Alongside a string of recent publicly announced mass layoffs – by companies including Nissan, Boeing and Citigroup – there have been a series of employers quietly justifying smaller-scale dismissals because of seemingly minor violations of company policy. Here the focus is not on the size and scope of redundancy programmes, how humanely managers handled them or whether support or severance pay was offered to affected staff, but on the specific rationale behind the decisions. Facebook owner Meta, for example, sacked about two dozen staff for abusing meal credit vouchers, while EY terminated the employment of a group of workers for watching multiple training videos at once, the Financial Times has reported. Infractions that workers have probably interpreted as minor misdemeanours in the past can now be sackable offences, and may prompt questions about whether cost savings are being disguised. “As with most stories, there are two sides,” says Leo Martin, managing director of GoodCorporation, a business ethics consultancy that helps organisations design, build and improve their ethics and compliance programmes. “From the employee perspective they may have been given unrealistic deadlines, excessive work pressures or have received unclear guidance as to what is expected, while the employer will feel that abusing a perk or taking short-cuts undermines their systems, [and that] cheating in an exam or lying about training … is a fundamental breach of trust.” Part of the motivation to take a tough line on employees could be to make an example of anyone deemed to be a rule-breaker. This level of corporate discipline has been more common among heavily regulated industries, such as banking and financial services, that have huge compliance functions and the risk of hefty penalties for any conduct breaches. Amanda Rajkumar, who has held senior human-resources (HR) leadership roles at JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas, says: “Banks and financial services have always come down hard … given the robust regulatory environment and strong requirement to demonstrate exemplary, ethical behaviour related to the fiduciary nature of the industry.” Another incentive for a tough stance is that small infractions, such as taking advantage of company perks or bending minor rules, can foreshadow more serious ethical lapses. This has fuelled a “zero-tolerance” approach to policy enforcement in some sectors, as companies seek to preserve what they see as a culture of integrity. One example from the financial crisis was when Fidelity Investments fired employees for being part of a fantasy football league that went against the company’s gambling rule. Early this year, several employees at US retailer Target were sacked after they used their status as staff to buy highly coveted Stanley cups ahead of customers. “The spotlight should be on the employees’ reason or motivation for breaking the rules,” adds Rajkumar. “A deliberate misuse of company resources usually indicates low engagement or a specific gripe against the firm.” A recent trend of staff turning to online platforms to vent their frustrations about perceived mistreatment by employers or indiscriminate layoffs has also pushed some companies to recalibrate their approach. Websites such as LinkedIn and anonymous review site, Glassdoor, give workers an outlet for grievances about their bosses, which can then spread quickly and damage the reputation of employers. In one example that went viral this year, Brittany Pietsch, an employee at internet company Cloudflare, recorded her nine-minute virtual meeting with HR representatives in which she was fired, and posted it to TikTok, spawning a new “Quit-Tok” trend. In the video, Pietsch confronted her seniors about the reasons for her termination, but they had “no specific” answers or “clarity”. Aware that employee complaints about terminations are no longer confined to private HR files, some companies are aiming to reduce backlash and curb reputational risk by emphasising policy-driven grounds for firing. Recruiters, HR heads and workplace experts say whether an employer has made a clear case for dismissal is becoming as important as the manner in which a termination is conducted. “Companies have had to be more mindful when they are firing staff because people are more vocal. We are in an era where snap decisions can have big blowbacks,” says Habiba Khatoon, a director at headhunter Robert Walters. She adds that in her experience managers are so wary of dismissing workers out of turn that they are delaying action until a record has been built of repeated performance issues or behaviour that violates company policy. Khatoon says more companies are talking about so-called “ethical firing”. This refers to a transparent, rule-based approach to dismissals, where managers can point to concrete breaches in policy rather than subjective issues, such as workers being a “poor fit”. Targeting terminations in this way has some advantages for employers. Basing decisions on documented infractions can help reduce staff numbers – and cut costs – without the optics of a struggling business that come with mass layoffs. And unlike big rounds of job cuts, which often require severance packages, firings for conduct issues are typically exempt from such obligations. Lucas Shaw, an expert in hiring and retention strategies, says he has been part of a conversation in which senior staff at a company – not one of his clients – instructed their IT team to look for misconduct on an individual’s record to avoid paying a costly redundancy settlement. “It’s incredibly underhand.” Employment experts say such practices underscore the need for staff to closely read and understand company policies and codes of conduct, which are at times being followed more rigidly than in the past. The advice for employers is to provide stronger and simpler guidelines about what is acceptable and what is not. Rules and disciplinary processes must be unambiguous and fairly applied no matter how senior an employee is. “Companies need to ensure they carry out fair and thorough investigations regarding any allegation of misconduct,” says GoodCorporation’s Martin. “Not only does this ensure a proper process is followed, it can also protect an organisation from accusations that what they are doing may have an ulterior motive.” In an era when workers prioritise transparency, selective enforcement of codes of conduct can erode trust as employees might see it as an excuse to target some staff. This, in the long run, may “be more damaging to the company than the actual employee misconduct”, warns Martin.

While it hasn’t gotten the attention of tech stocks or AI stocks, shares of alternative asset manager Brookfield Corporation (BN) have been red hot this year, surging 66.5% over the past 12 months. What’s more, 13F filings show that super investors like Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman and Third Point’s Daniel Loeb loaded up on the stock during the third quarter. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I’m bullish on Brookfield based on its sterling long-term track record of delivering market-beating returns, compelling long-term vision for the future, the large positions that top investors like Ackman and Loeb are taking in the stock, and its perfect 10 rating from TipRanks’ Smart Score system. Let’s take a closer look at this $85 billion company. Brookfield Corporation describes itself as a “leading global investment firm focused on building long-term wealth for institutions and individuals.” The Toronto, Canada-based firm is an alternative asset manager that operates businesses in a wide array of industries, including asset management, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, private equity, and more. During the third quarter, renowned investors like Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb accumulated significant positions in Brookfield. Loeb’s Third Point Capital, which has nearly $7.5 billion in assets under management, initiated a new position in the company, buying 4,725,000 shares for an average price of $53.15 per share, according to the firm’s 13F filing. Brookfield is Third Point’s eleventh-largest holding as of the filing. At the same time, Bill Ackman’s firm Pershing Square, which was already an investor in Brookfield after initiating a position during the second quarter, increased its stake in the company by nearly 380%. Pershing Square now owns 32,735,883 shares of Brookfield and is the fund’s largest holding, accounting for 13.5% of assets, indicating that Ackman has significant conviction in the pick and sees it as one of the best investment opportunities in the current market. Brookfield has proven itself to be a long-term winner. Over the past decade, the company has delivered a phenomenal total return of 800%. This massive total return easily outpaces that of the broader market — the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) returned 187.3% over the same time horizon. And Brookfield’s track record of generating exceptional returns goes back even further then that — the company has delivered a phenomenal total annualized return of 18% over the past 30 years. While Brookfield has an excellent long-term track record, it isn’t resting on its laurels — it says that its best days are still ahead of it and that it is now better-positioned than ever before to deliver annualized returns of 15% or more going forward. Brookfield’s management says it will achieve this by investing in good businesses, running these businesses well, wisely allocating free cash flow, aligning everyone with its long-term goals, and adapting to the changing world around them. Examples of the company adapting to the changing world include its extensive investments in the energy transition and its involvement in data centers. Brookfield management says it expects to grow free cash flow by 20% per share on an annual basis over the next five years. This means it will generate a total of $47 billion in free cash flow over this time frame, or $30 per share that it can “allocate wisely,” which is an attractive total given that shares currently trade for $57.67. Brookfield says this will help it to deliver annualized returns on invested capital of 16% over the next five years. While shares currently trade for $57.67, Brookfield believes they are worth an intrinsic value of $84 per share today and that this 16% CAGR on invested capital will bring it to a valuation of $176 per share by 2029, meaning that the share price could be more than triple over the next five years. Obviously, a lot can happen between now and 2029, and even the best plans can face unexpected challenges. There’s also certainly no guarantee the market will agree with Brookfield about the intrinsic value of its shares at that point in time. That said, even if Brookfield doesn’t reach this exact number, there is plenty of room for considerable upside between the current share price and Brookfield’s target, making this a tempting value proposition for investors. Brookfield also believes that it is well-positioned to grow earnings per share at a 20% clip over the next five years to $9.77 per share (up from $3.67 for 2024). If the company can achieve this, it is trading for a song at today’s prices. While these are lofty targets, Brookfield’s excellent track record over multiple decades lends credibility to the idea that the company can achieve many of these goals. While Brookfield has a fairly low dividend yield of 0.6%, it’s worth noting that it has still returned an impressive $20 billion worth of capital to its shareholders over the last five years through both dividends and share buybacks. With cash flow expected to increase in the years to come, as discussed above, I would expect the company to continue to reward its shareholders with considerable capital returns. Turning to Wall Street, BN earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average BN stock price target of $60 implies 2.4% upside potential from current levels. See more BN analyst ratings Adding to Brookfield’s appeal, it also achieves a Perfect 10 rating from TipRanks’ Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating, so Brookfield’s perfect rating is particularly impressive. Shares of Brookfield have posted strong gains over the past year, and the stock is catching the eye of renowned investors like Third Point’s Daniel Loeb and Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman. But you don’t have to be a hedge fund manager to gain exposure to this compelling investment opportunity; everyday investors can add Brookfield to their own portfolios. If management can execute on achieving this five-year vision, this would represent phenomenal returns for all of the stock’s investors. I’m bullish on Brookfield based on the confidence of these prestigious investors, its track record as a long-term winner, and its compelling roadmap for delivering substantial returns over the next five years.

Title: Andy Farrell praises Ireland’s young guns for stepping up in Fiji win

Andy Farrell cut a contented figure after Ireland’s commanding 52-17 win over Fiji. He took particularly pleasure in making it a notable day for the debutants, Gus McCarthy and Cormac Izuchukwu, as well as Sam Prendergast in his first Test start, on a day when opportunity knocked for so many. But the sight of Jacob Stockdale pulling up with a hamstring injury, as well as Jamie Osborne departing due to an adductor injury, somewhat tarnished the day. “[Stockdale] pulled up sharp with a hamstring so obviously we’ll see how that is tomorrow. But he pulled up quite sharp, so I was gutted for him,” said the Ireland head coach. He added Osborne was unable to carry on, “so that doesn’t look bright at the minute.” The only blemish on Izuchukwu’s day in becoming the first Irish men’s 15-a-side international from Co Offaly was having a try ruled out by referee Hollie Davidson for a forward pass by Mack Hansen which looked marginal. “I was gutted for Izzy in regards to the forward pass, it was marginal, so Mack says anyway,” said Farrell. “It would have been nice for him to get over the line. I thought he was a presence, certainly in the lineout. He’s some athlete. [ Ireland make light work of ill-disciplined FijiOpens in new window ] [ Ireland v Fiji player ratings: Bundee Aki bounces back, Caelan Doris leads by exampleOpens in new window ] “You give people these opportunities for them to realise their own potential. It’s what they do with that experience now, that’s going to be important pushing on. “What a story there for Gus,” Farrell said of the 21-year-old Blackrock and Leinster hooker. “Two years ago (he was) lifting the Senior Cup at Caelan’s school. I thought he did a brilliant job. “A harsh call, I thought, on the first lineout,” added Farrell in relation to the first of two calls deeming McCarthy’s lineout throw crooked. “But it never bothered him at all. He just kept going to play 80 minutes and played the finish at number 7. Himself and his family will remember that forever.” As he was when Prendergast made his debut off the bench against Argentina a week ago, Farrell was effusive in his praise of the 21-year-old Leinster outhalf. “I thought he did great. I thought he was really composed. The kick to the corner, that was harsh as well, but it didn’t bother him,” said Farrell of Prendergast’s penalty to the corner which was ruled to have found touch in goal. “He had a few mistakes within his game but he was pulling the strings for a good while, and he was really, really composed. “It’s tough against Fiji because you don’t know what you’re going to get in front of you at times. “Certainly, the breakdown is an absolute mess at times, because they’re so ferocious there and they’re so short defensively that you can see the space but you have them shooting out from out wide, and to have the composure and play the line like he did at times, I thought it was a great showing from him.” Ireland captain Caelan Doris felt it was the best of Ireland’s three Autumn Nations Series games so far ahead of their game against Joe Schmidt’s revitalised Wallabies next Saturday. “It felt pretty dominant out there. Good start to the game, similar to last week, and the message at half-time was to have a ruthless start to the second half and to kick on. Our attack hasn’t quite fired in the second half over the last couple of weeks, but it was good today, we got a few tries off the back of it,” said Doris in light of Ireland scoring four tries in each half. “It’s pretty pleasing, I think like Faz mentioned, there was a bit of an onus on some of the older, more experienced guys to take a bit of a load off the younger guys, and I think there’s a pretty even spread across the week, even the guys who weren’t playing stood up and allowed the young guys to do what they do best.” Doris, having opened the scoring himself, was heavily involved in a couple more off strike plays, notably the trick tap penalty move when he gave the try-scoring pass to Josh van der Flier, which he accredited to Paul O’Connell. Prendergast’s day might have panned out differently had his yellow card been upgraded to a red, with the Fijian head coach Mick Byrne remarking: “I think he was wearing a green jersey so it stayed yellow.” Informed of Byrne’s remark, Farrell responded: “Ah, I get why it is but for me he turned his back and it’s harsh enough. I don’t know, I’ll have to have a look at it again but that’s the game, isn’t it? “I thought our discipline was pretty good in general and it certainly added to the reason why, if you look at the story of the game and you fast forward it, I thought territory-wise and dominance-wise, yes, a couple of execution bits could have been better, I thought our discipline added to our strong hold on the game.” Both Byrne and Fiji’s captain Waisale Nayacalevu accepted their concession of 17 penalties was of their own making. “They’re probably on us, they’re definitely on us,” admitted Byrne, while also lamenting “a few defensive lapses”. Nayacalevu didn’t believe they weren’t being respected by World Rugby and officials, but added: “We got out there and give our best. We train all week to be disciplined, to play the game the way we want to play and at the end of the day, the match officials make the calls. “Sometimes it doesn’t go your way, which is frustrating. At the moment, it’s happening, and if we can have that fair play call, then we can play more entertaining rugby and we get more momentum as well going into our games, playing how we want to play.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Storm Bert live updates: 11,000 homes and businesses remain without power in counties worst affected

Some 11,000 electricity customers remain without power on Saturday evening as a result of Storm Bert, ESB Networks has said. Those who remain disconnected are predominantly in areas worst hit by the storm including counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway. ESB Networks said while most customers currently without power will have their supply restored by Saturday night, it could not rule out further power outages as the storm moves slowly across the country. The worst of the weather so far appears to have struck the northwest, with more than 3,000 people in Carndonagh and Dungloe are among those not expected to have electricity restored until Saturday night. In Cork, Ardcahan Bridge remains impassable after heavy flooding caused by Storm Bert. #CorkTraffic Ardcahan Bridge remains closed, and impassable due to flooding. #StormBert pic.twitter.com/UWYSz703p0 In Galway where a landslide has closed Maam Road in Leenane, some 50mm of rain are reported to have fallen in the Maam Valley on Saturday. There are further reports this afternoon of roads closed in the in Belclare, Kilconly and near Athenry. At Cork Airport one flight from Birmingham has been diverted to Shannon and the authority has advised passengers due to travel this weekend to contact their airline directly for updates to their travel plans. The airport remains open. On the east coast Irish Ferries’ sailings between Rosslare and Pembroke have been cancelled. Irish Ferries said passengers can be accommodated on the Dublin-Holyhead route. John Fallon reports from Galway: Flood protection measures taken six years ago in the Spanish Arch area of Galway city appear to be working with Storm Bert not causing any overnight damage. Businesses in the area who suffered significant flooding a few years ago have installed their own flood prevention measures, while a large inflated boom provided by Galway City Council along the banks of the River Corrib as it meets the sea in the Claddagh Basin has also helped alleviate the threat. Niall McNeilus, a Labour Cllr who owns Claddagh and Celtic Jewellery at Quay Lane near the Spanish Arch, said businesses and residents in the area are always on their guard. “The measures taken by the individual owners of buildings in the area, coupled with the measures from the city council, certainly have alleviated the problem,” he said. “But you are always fearful. The storm last night wasn’t as severe as feared and thankfully didn’t do too much damage but there are a lot of roads impassable around the county and thousands of homes and businesses, particularly in Connemara, are without electricity.” Meanwhile, swimmers at Blackrock in Salthill were not deterred by the stormy weather with several dozens taking to the water on Saturday morning. “This is ground zero when it comes to flooding.” In Wexford, Aontú's Cllr Jim Codd is in Duncormick where cars are being pulled from the flooded area. Councillor Jim Codd highlighting issue of flooding in South Wexford once again today. pic.twitter.com/dEymU2HRrT Another video of flooding from Storm Bert, this time from the Abbeyfeale area of Co Limerick. Overflow from the river Feale flooded local GAA pitches. Rebecca Mullen of The Flour House bakery in Riverstick, Co Cork, said that Storm Babet flooded the bakery last October, and the bakery had flooded again after Storm Bert. They had received grants from the Red Cross to help them through the last flood where a lot of damage was done. “Without those grants we really wouldn’t have a business today, it’s just really important that small businesses survive weather systems,” she told the PA news agency. “Saturday is one of our busiest days, we’ve already had to cancel a market because of the weather system, so now we’ve obviously had to shut the shop today, so we’ll be losing money there. “I’ve done deliveries of cakes today where I can to the people who have ordered, but now it’s the clean up, its the cost of getting the staff back in, extra hours, working out what is salvageable and what isn’t.” She said small businesses are already struggling because of rising costs such as the 13.5 per cent VAT rate and staff pay. “Every day counts. You can’t miss a day’s trade. I think that’s what’s going to really hurt us. Every single piece of coinage is required to get us through.” You can see the flooding in the video below: ⚠️Following extreme rainfall, floodwaters are rising at various locations throughout the county.

The L5465-0 off the R579 is closed after the river Allow burst its banks. The L1121-55 is also flooded at Roskeen off the N72. Motorists are advised to avoid driving through floods. This video shows the Flour House Bakery and Café and the adjacent private dwelling in Riverstick, Co Cork, where the gullies flowing into the nearby Stick river were unable to take the volume of rain. Met Éireann has warned of further windy conditions on Saturday night with heavy rain in places and spot flooding continuing to track eastwards across the country. Lowest temperatures are expected to be between 5-9 degrees in fresh to strong and gusty south to southwest winds. The national forecaster reiterated it has a status yellow wind warning in place for Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow. The warning is valid up to 2am on Sunday. ESB Networks has reduced the number of homes and businesses without power due to Storm Bert to about 34,000, down from a high of 60,000 before early on Saturday morning. As of lunchtime on Saturday, the worst of the damage to the electricity network caused by Storm Bert remained in the northwest. Some 1,674 homes and businesses in the Dungloe area of Co Donegal remain connected with the ESB online fault map indicating power will be restored by 8pm. In Carndonagh, Co Donegal 1,483 customers were also expected to be reconnected by 8pm, as were 594 customers in Kilcar, Co Donegal. On Achill Island, some 248 customers have been told it may be 9.30pm before their power is restored. In Clifden, Co Galway, 1076 customers have been given a time of 5pm for restoration of service. In Macroom, Co Cork, 1,630 customers have been told their power will be restored by 1pm. In the Gurranebane area, near Valentia island in Co Kerry, some 768 electricity customers have been given a time of 2pm for the restoration of power. In Dublin where disruption was not as severe as many other counties, 100 customers at Stephenstown, near Skerries, will be waiting until 4pm for power to be restored. In Greystones, Co Wicklow, a further 32 customers have been told their supply will be restored by 2pm. ESB Networks has said the next update will take place close to 5pm. John Fallon is also reporting from Galway: Galway County Council crews are continuing to deal with extensive flooding in Clifden where a number of roads in the Connemara town are flooded. Meanwhile, some houses in the Inverin area of south Connemara whose electricity supply was disrupted during a snowstorm during the week remain without power. ESB crews are working to restore power to hundreds of houses and businesses in Galway. A number of roads throughout Co Galway remain flooded with motorists advised to take caution in areas such as Claregalway, Mountain North near Athenry, and Belclare and Sylaun near Tuam. Image of the landslide in Maam Galway this morning. pic.twitter.com/E2FiwIOkTz Andrew Hamilton reports from Galway: Four large mudslides have taken place on different roads surrounding the village of Leenane in north Galway overnight. The largest of these mudslides took place on the Leenane to Maam road and crews from both Galway County Council and Mayo County Council have been working to reopen the road this morning. The mudslides came as heavy rains from Storm Bert combined with melting snow on nearby mountains. “There were four mudslides in total, including one big one on the Leenane to Maam road. That completely blocked the road there,” said Fianna Fáil Cllr Gerry King. “There was one on the Leenane to Louisburgh road, another on the Letterfrack side of Leenane village and a fourth one, a minor enough one, on the Leenane to Maam road. “Thankfully there was nobody hurt in the mudslides and no major damage reported. Galway and Mayo councils are out working on the roads at the moment. Work is still ongoing but cars should be flowing again soon.” Further south, five houses were evacuated in the Clifden area as the Owenglen river burst its banks. The Galway fire service were on hand from 5am to pump water away from four houses in the Clifden Glen Estate and one house located on the low road in Clifden. It is understood that several centimetres of water entered one house in the Clifden Glen Estate but the efforts of the fire service have saved the other evacuated houses from damage. “This is the second time that this area has been hit. There was severe flooding here four years ago. Four houses in Clifden Glen were evacuated this morning and now the water is receding,” said Fianna Fáil Eileen Mannion. “I don’t know the extent of the damage yet but if water comes into your house it is very damaging.” #CorkTraffic Storm damage to a wall on the N72 outside of Ballyhooly.

High tide in Bantry passed without incident, according to Cork County Council, as crews will continue to be deployed across the county amid flooding in several areas. The R588 Copeen to Enniskeane road is closed due to flooding, while the R621 Longfield Bridge, Mallow, remains closed to traffic. There is also flooding on the R624 outside IFI Cobh. Council crews have been deployed and motorists are advised to avoid the area. Crews are also assessing fallen trees near overhead cables at Westview Cobh. Members of the public are advised to avoid this area. In Monaghan, the council is reporting that Castle Road is flooded, but Monaghan Shopping Centre is still operating as usual. ⚠️ #StormBert Update: Castle Road is flooded, cars should not enter the flood water.

Ronan McGreevy has all the latest in our election blog here. Irish Rail has said there is disruption on Dublin to Belfast services due to flooding between Newry and Lurgan. The company said there are also delays to early Westport and Sligo to Dublin services due to flooding on the tracks. Also on the travel front, Transport For Ireland said those seeking Local Link bus services should check with relevant transport operators before travelling as there may be delays or curtailments due to adverse weather conditions. Some services will be travelling at reduced speeds in the interests of safety. Bus Éireann has cancelled a number of services in the south of the country. For details, check the company website here. Barry Roche shares this photo of the bridge at the entrance to Belgooly in Co Cork where Storm Bert has caused flooding. Clare County Council has advised the N67 north of Lisdoonvarna, between Toovareragh Church and Killeany junction, is impassable due to flooding. The road is now closed. In Co Kerry, flooding has been reported in Tralee near the Rose Hotel. The N22 at Glenflesk is flooded as are roads at Fossa village, Glenbeigh, as well as the N71 near Kenmare and localised flooding in Killarney. Regional Road at Glenflesk is closed to traffic due to flooding. pic.twitter.com/1Z1Q8cK9t4 Barry Roche reports from Cork: A bakery owner and a homeowner in the centre of Riverstick village in South Cork were left counting the cost of Storm Bert as the gullies flowing into the nearby Stick river were unable to take the volume of rain and water began spouting up and flowing into both buildings. Units of Cork County Fire Service from nearby Kinsale and other Cork County Council staff responded and began pumping out water from both the Flour House Bakery and Café and the adjacent private dwelling. Local general election candidate Cllr Alan Coleman (Independent) said that the Office of Public Works (OPW) had provided some €40,000 for flood relief work on the river Stick but this was inadequate and he called on the agency to provide more funding to expedite the work. “The OPW has provided €40,000 but that will go nowhere near resolving the flooding problem in Riverstick – it’s not a major job – another €200,000 would be enough so I’m calling on the OPW to provide the money and expedite the work so as to avoid any repeat of today’s flooding.” Irish Times photographer Alan Betson shares this image of a blustery Dublin bay this Saturday morning. Back in Donegal, a video shared by business owner Mairéad Ó Hagan Anderson shows the level of flooding on Bridge Street in the Killybegs area. Thomas Pringle, a TD for the area, said his constituency office on Bridge Street along with several homes and businesses were flooded. “My thoughts are with everyone impacted,” Mr Pringle said. I cannot believe this is our town. The poor families and businesses on this street. Absolutely shocking. A tree was obstructing the flow of the river. pic.twitter.com/Xn8O6NEQlL While the status red warning for Cork has expired, Cork County Council says the effects of the rainfall event and strong winds may linger into the day.

Council crews are on the ground and anyone travelling is advised to do so with care. An update from Dublin Airport says flights are moving well but there have been a few delayed due to wind. “Staff are working hard to ensure minimal disruption for passengers,” a statement said. One incoming flight has been cancelled this morning due to weather conditions at the other airport. Barry Roche reports: Cork City Council has announced that the Corkmas Festive Market at Emmet Place will not open today due to Storm Bert while reports are also emerging of flooding on the R579 between Healy’s Bridge and Cloghroe on a stretch of road adjacent to the Shournagh river. John Fallon in Galway reports: Galway County Council advised motorists not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary as some roads are flooded in the region following a night of heavy rain. Storm Bert reached landfall last night but early morning reports in Galway suggest that damage has not been as bad as initially feared. ESB crews are working to restore power in some areas with Connemara the worst hit. There is flooding on the main N59 road from Galway on the approach to Clifden with local authority crews monitoring rising river levels. There is also localised flooding in An Spidéal and on the N83 approaching Claregalway. Back in north Cork, Barry Roche reports that more than 750 customers around Mallow lost power at about 7.30am but almost 550 of these have since had power restored. In east Cork, more than 2,000 homes in Youghal have been without electricity since approximately 8.30am. A new status yellow warning has been issued for Donegal from 8am on Sunday until 5am on Monday. Met Éireann also issued a new yellow warning for Clare, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo from 8am-7pm on Sunday. The forecaster reminded people to be careful of fallen trees and dangerous driving conditions. In Northern Ireland, police are urging motorists to take extra care on a number of roads in the Newtownards area because of the impact of poor weather conditions. It said that a fallen tree on the Belfast Road and on the Springvale Road, between Ballyhalbert and Ballywalter, has blocked both lanes. The PSNI said a shed roof has been blown on to the Ballyquinn Road, Dungiven, and is causing an obstruction, and there is a heavy build-up of traffic in the Dunhill Road area of Coleraine because of snow. – PA As Met Éireann forecasts the storm to remain the dominant feature of the weather over the weekend, ESB Networks said the numbers of premises without power had reached 60,000 and “further power outages can be expected”. The ESB said its teams were closely monitoring the storm’s impact on power supplies and “all available resources remain on alert”. Flooding is becoming a significant problem along the west coast this morning as damage brought by Storm Bert is assessed. The river Feale in Abbeyfeale, Co Limerick, has overflowed its banks.

In Clifden, Co Galway, surface water is becoming a hazard to motorists. Bus Éireann has cancelled services on Route 434 between Clifden and Westport. In Killybegs, Co Donegal, the town has been flooded with up to two feet of water reported in the streets. It is understood a fallen tree blocked a local river which diverted into the town. Emergency services are at the scene but significant damage to homes and property is expected.

The Galway city interagency emergency group is bracing for flooding in areas across the city. Local authority crews are monitoring the situation as high waves batter the coastline. Barry Roche in Cork reports: It appears that Cork city has escaped flooding with gardaí at Anglesea Street reporting that they had received no reports of any flooding from either the city centre, or its suburbs and satellites such as Glanmire and Carrigaline which have been hit badly in the past. Cork City Council had issued a statement earlier, saying that based on information from Met Éireann, there was no tidal flooding expected in Cork city and that Storm Bert was a pluvial or rainfall event that may lead to just localised spot flooding. Meanwhile, ESB Networks reported a number of outages in both Cork and Kerry due high winds bringing down trees on power lines. Carrigaline was among the worst affected, where almost 2,500 customers were without power for several hours with 152 still awaiting restoration this morning. Further west, some 1,300 customers in Rathmore, in Co Kerry, lost power around 6am but it is expected they will have power restored by midday. On the Iveragh Peninsula in South Kerry, some 2,500 customers around Cahersiveen and Waterville lost power at different stages.

Affected counties where large areas have lost power include Donegal Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Cork and Clare. In Donegal some 12,000 people are currently without electricity with the worst of the outages in exposed areas near Gaoth Dobhair and Buncrana. In Cahersiveen, Co Kerry, 6,813 premises are without power. About 7,000 households and businesses Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon have been left without power, with many additionally damaged by localised flooding ESB spokesperson Paul Hand said crews and contractors are responding where safe to do so. Mr Hand said the next update on numbers of homes and businesses affected would be available in about an hour. Estimated restoration times are being posted on www.PowerCheck.ie and www.ESBNetworks.ie as restoration work progresses. The authority said any damage to network should be reported by calling 1800 372 999. Rain and snow warnings cover Northern Ireland from midnight on Friday until 11am on Saturday. P&O Ferries said it had cancelled the 4am sailing between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland’s south west on Saturday. Barry Roche in Cork reports: Business people and homeowners in Bantry in West Cork were this morning breathing a sigh of relief as the town escaped flooding, amid fears that heavy rainfall from Storm Bert might bring a repeat of last month’s inundation which saw over 40 houses and shops flooded. Met Eireann had issued a status red red rain warning for Cork and Galway with West Cork braced for the worst of the weather but this morning at 7am, gardai in Bantry were reporting that there was no major flooding anywhere in the town other than minor surface flooding on some roads. Gardai in Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen similarly reported that all three towns – each the beneficiary of significant investment by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in flood relief schemes in recent years – had again not suffered any flooding other than some surface water on roads. However, Cork Safety Alerts was reporting that there was flooding on the main Cork to Bantry road, R586 at Ballineen while there was also flooding on the Bantry Line, the R587 at Ardcahan north of Dunmanway and both roads were impassable. In East Cork where Midleton, like Bantry, is still awaiting a major OPW flood relief scheme and both homeowners and businesspeople are constantly on high alert for any Met Éireann rain warnings after Storm Babet caused millions of euros worth of damage in October 2023. On Saturday morning, gardaí in Midleton at 7.15am, had received no reports of any flooding in the town or in any of the surrounding villages such as Ladysbridge, Mogeely, Whitegate, Castlemartyr and Killeagh where dozens of properties were damaged in Storm Babet. As of 7am on Saturday morning it seemed that Cork county had escaped any major flooding with Mallow and Fermoy, thanks to OPW flood defence systems, avoiding a return to the inundation that was a perennial feature of both towns when the Blackwater burst its banks. There was some surface road flooding on low lying roads and around Mallow, and Cork County Council did post that some local roads off the main Mallow- Killarney road (the N72), were closed at Spa Glen, Ballylough Cross and Parkadallane. The council was forced to announce road closures at the Killavullen Road on the southern side of Mallow and at Longfields Bridge at Newberry west and upstream of the town due to rising water levels in the Blackwater. Closer to Cork city, the operators of the Cross Ferry from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe, which links Cobh while Passage West and Monkstown, announced the cancellation of sailings this morning due to high winds. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Talaght Stadium will host the Leinster Schools final The Leinster Schools Senior Cup final will move out of Dublin 4 and into Dublin 24 next March, with Tallaght Stadium set to host the marquee game for the first time. The RDS has hosted the final in since Lansdowne Road was redeveloped, but is out of action for the next year due to the redevelopment of the Anglesea Stand. The Aviva Stadium is unavailable, but is also considered to be too big for the size of the crowd expected. With the capacity of Energia Park in Donnybrook capped at 6,000, Leinster have been on the look out for an alternative venue and the home of Shamrock Rovers in Tallaght has emerged as the favourite. South Dublin County Council, which own the 10,716 capacity stadium and lets it to Rovers, are understood to be keen to host the game. Leinster have previously played pre-season matches at the venue, facing Ulster in 2014 and Gloucester in 2016, while Ireland ‘A’ played the Argentina Jaguares there in 2009. The draw for the competition will take place on December 9 and it is understood that it will be confirmed at that time, with Blackrock College defending the title they won at the RDS earlier this year.

Title: ChatGPT updates, warehouse robots, and special agents: This week's AI launches
URL: https://qz.com/openai-chatgpt-physical-ai-agents-startup-funding-1851706500
Time Published: 2024-11-23T10:00:00Z

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI announced this week that it’s starting to roll out Advanced Voice Mode on the web browser version of ChatGPT. Paid users of ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu will be able to start a real-time conversation on the ChatGPT website. The AI startup also announced that it updated its GPT-4o model’s creative writing ability to have “more natural, engaging, and tailored writing.” The updated model can also work better with uploaded files, OpenAI said. The Allen Institute for AI announced its Tülu 3 family of open, fine-tuned models this week. The fine-tuning, or post-training, process refines models to perform specific tasks. Through Tülu 3, developers and researchers can find open-source data sets, model training recipes, code, and evaluation frameworks. The models range from 8 billion to 70 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its ability to make predictions, according to Ai2. Enveda, a biotech company that uses AI to turn natural compounds into new medicines, announced an oversubscribed $130 million Series C funding round this week. The round was led by Kinnevik and FPV, and brings Enveda’s total funding to $360 million. The funding will help the company with advancing its pipeline of ten development drug candidates. Enveda is building an AI-powered platform called a “sequencer” “that combines metabolomics data with machine learning and high-throughput biological experiments to answer two fundamental questions of any natural sample at scale: (1) What are the molecules?, and (2) What do they do?,” the company said. “Some of the world’s greatest pharmaceutical breakthroughs have been derived from just 0.1% of nature’s chemistry,” Viswa Colluru, chief executive of Enveda, said in a statement. “We developed our platform to rapidly expand access to nature’s chemistry to find therapeutics at roughly four times the speed–and it’s already delivering results in the form of a deep and differentiated pipeline. This funding will help us advance multiple candidates to exciting clinical catalysts in the next year, confirming our guiding vision that life’s chemistry is an excellent source for new medicines.” Pickle Robot, which develops robotic automation systems for unloading trucks, announced a $50 million Series B funding round this week. The company, which calls itself a pioneer of physical AI, also announced that six customers have ordered over 30 production robots in the third quarter for deployment in early 2025. Pickle Robot’s physical AI technology combines a vision system with generative AI foundation models trained on millions of real logistics and warehouse operations data. “Pickle Robot customers are experiencing the value of Physical AI applied to a common logistics process that challenges thousands of operations every day,” AJ Meyer, chief executive and founder of Pickle Robot, said in a statement. “The new funding and our strategic customer relationships enable Pickle to chart the future of supply chain robotics, rapidly expand our core product capabilities, and grow our business to deliver tremendous customer value now and in the future.” Lightning AI, the company behind the PyTorch Lightning deep learning framework, announced a $50 million equity investment this week that included Nvidia (NVDA) and J.P. Morgan (JPM). PyTorch Lightning has received over 160 million downloads since Lightning AI launched a year ago. Lightning AI combines dozens of separate AI development tools on one, multi-cloud platform where developers can build, train, and deploy AI models, and host AI apps securely. “Building your own AI platform today is like building your own Slack — it’s complex, costly, and not core to your business,” William Falcon, founder and chief executive of Lightning AI, said in a statement. “The value for enterprises lies in their data, domain knowledge, and unique models — not in maintaining AI infrastructure. We have thousands of developers single-handedly training and deploying models at a scale that would have required teams of developers without Lightning.” Thoughtful AI launched its specialized AI agents for revenue cycle management in healthcare this week. The AI-powered revenue cycle transformation company’s new agents include CODY for coding and notes review, and CAM for claims processing. “Our team of AI Agents turn RCM from a bottleneck into a powerhouse, using AI and automation to tackle tedious, time-consuming tasks so that healthcare teams can optimize revenue and focus on what matters most – patients,” Alex Zekoff, co-founder and chief executive of Thoughtful AI, said in a statement. Reforged Labs, an AI-powered video creation service for mobile game studios, launched its AI-powered video ad service this week that it says can deliver tailored, cost-effective ads in less than 24 hours. The startup’s proprietary AI engine was trained with thousands of game ads, Reforged Labs said. “We want to help level the playing field for game studios with limited resources,” Robert Huynh, chief executive and co-founder of Reforged Labs, said in a statement. “With our full-service creative solution that’s tailored for game marketing, studios can benefit from proven ad templates and AI-driven production and editing, all without lengthy briefs or big budgets.”

Title: In Fiji, defense diplomacy and rain-soaked rugby
URL: https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/fiji-defense-diplomacy-and-rain-soaked-rugby/401269/

Full Content:
U.S. Defense Secretary reviews Fijian troops at Black Rock Camp, Fiji, on Nov. 22, 2024. U.S. Air Force / Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders Stay Connected Bradley Peniston BLACKROCK CAMP, Fiji—Fijian and U.S. officials cemented one defense agreement and opened talks on another—but first, there was roast pig and rugby in the rain. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived on this South Pacific island on Friday, the final stop on a nine-day journey that has taken him to Australia, the Philippines, and Laos. “The goal really here is to not just regularize, but to make more frequent our engagement” with Fiji and the Pacific island region, a senior defense official said ahead of Austin’s arrival. Austin’s visit here is the first by a U.S. defense secretary, but among a handful in recent years by various cabinet-level officials. Fiji is a leader in the region and one of three Pacific-island countries that maintains a standing professional military. It also controls a wide swath of waters and resources in its exclusive economic zone. “People call them ‘small island nations,’ but really should call them ‘large oceanic states,’” one U.S. official said. On Austin’s to-do list: wrap up 10 years of U.S. work on an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, or ACSA, a bilateral pact intended to smooth the way for joint U.S-Fijian military logistics. “From fuel to medical supplies to the use of maintenance facilities,” the senior defense official said. “When things happen, they happen fast. So to be able to say that we're able to do that, to offer that kind of logistical support, it's critical.” More than 120 countries have ACSA agreements with the United States. Some, such as Japan and South Korea, have copied the idea and signed their own ACSA-type deals with others. Such agreements do not commit signatories to military action in any way. Austin also came to launch talks on a status-of-forces agreement, another document that deepens a bilateral defense relationship. SOFAs lay out the legal status of U.S. troops and dependents in a foreign country, including civil and criminal jurisdiction. Basing arrangements, if any, are typically negotiated separately. “The SOFA will enable us to deploy and redeploy forces in support of Fiji and help us train with the Fijians on a very routine basis,” Austin said Saturday at a press conference at a nearby hotel and conference center. “I look for routine rotations, training rotations, where possible, to be conducted,” plus continued work with the Nevada National Guard. Austin said “there is no notion” of permanently basing U.S. troops in Fiji. “We did not have any discussions like that.” If SOFA negotiations are concluded as expected next year, Fiji will join several dozen nations that already have such agreements with the United States. Austin also said the U.S. would soon deliver several rigid-hull inflatable boats and a boat ramp to help Fiji patrol its waters, and announced plans for $4.9 million in foreign military financing, pending congressional approval. The senior defense official said Fiji would put the new funds toward small arms. “Again, building military capacity, right? Professionalization of the military. This will go really straight to what they're asking for, what the needs are,” they said. At the press conference, a local reporter asked Austin what to expect from the incoming administration of Donald Trump. “Fiji has always considered climate change a national-security threat,” the reporter said. “And we have President-elect Trump who considers climate change a hoax and who has also in the past pulled out of the Paris Accord.” What, he asked, should the Pacific expect in the way of U.S. leadership? “I can't tell you what the next administration will do in terms of policy adjustments or things of that nature,” Austin responded. “What I can tell you is that I'm absolutely proud of the work that we've done. We've advanced things in a number of areas and we've strengthened our relationship. “And I truly believe that the strength of those relationships will endure far beyond the transition of administrations. I think the United States enjoys the strongest network of allies and partners in the world. We have the largest network of allies and partners in the world. And our relationship with allies and partners around the globe has enabled us to sustain our efforts and to endure a number of challenges globally. And I'm confident that our strong relationship that we have now will continue to blossom.” Austin’s visit began with an elaborate welcoming ceremony at Blackrock Camp that included drums, dancing, and the presentation of a roast pig so large it took six grass-skirted Fijian troops to lay it before the visiting secretary. The rain-dampened proceedings continued with a 15-minute rugby game between the base’s team and a local village club. At the Saturday press conference, Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka recalled that Austin had played rugby at West Point. “If he’d come when he was younger, we’d have tried to recruit him for our rugby team,” Rabuka said. “You have some pretty good players,” Austin replied.

Title: 3 underrated Netflix movies you should watch this weekend (November 22-24)

Time Published: 2024-11-22T21:30:29Z

Are you ready to get Glicked this weekend? No, I didn’t call you a dirty name, that’s the actual moniker being used for the simultaneous release of Wicked and Gladiator II. I’m not going to see either this weekend as both are expected to make tons of cash and draw in a lot of crowds in theaters over the next few days. I’m content to stay in this weekend and queue up a good movie (or three) on Netflix. Feel the same way? Well, here’s a handy list of a few underrated movies that are worth your time. You can always watch Glicked later in the year … or never, if that’s more your vibe. We also have guides to the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on Max, and the best movies on Disney+. Sometimes, you just need to see two bona fide movie stars show off their charisma for two hours even if the movie they are in is only so-so. That’s the case with Spy Game, a 2001 action thriller from Top Gun director Tony Scott. The stars in question are Robert Redford, then entering his senior citizen heartthrob phase, and Brad Pitt, who was still in his prime, golden locks and all. It’s a pity the movie itself wasn’t any better. Redford stars as Nathan Muir, a grizzled CIA officer who is pulled into one final case involving his former protégé, Tom Bishop (Pitt). It seems Bishop has run afoul with China’s government and is set to be executed in 24 hours. Muir is the only one who can save him, but as he reflects on their complicated past and their shady spy missions in locales such as West Germany, he wonders if this isn’t the fate Bishop deserves. Spy Game is streaming on Netflix. In Good Company is just good enough, and what’s wrong with that? The 2004 comedy, which is just about to celebrate its 20th(!) anniversary, is the very definition of vanilla, with squeaky clean stars like Topher Grace, Scarlett Johansson, and Dennis Quaid all bringing varying degrees of beige to their respective roles. Yet the movie works, and Quaid in particular stands out as a star who knows how to turn on the charm to win over an audience. Dan Foreman (Quaid) is a longtime ad executive who is good at his job. That doesn’t prevent his company from undergoing severe layoffs and demoting him so he now reports to Carter Duryea (Grace), a 26-year-old business prodigy who is separating from his cheating wife. That’s awkward enough, but when Dan invites Carter over to dinner one night and his young boss begins to fall in love with his even younger daughter Alex (Johansson), things go from awkward to just plain weird fast. The movie plays this scenario largely for laughs, and it is funny to see Quaid work through the sheer absurdity of watching his twentysomething boss awkwardly try to romance his college-bound daughter. Is it also icky? Yeah, a bit, but Quaid and the rest of the cast sells it and the movie doesn’t take itself too seriously. In Good Company is streaming on Netflix. Animation is currently in a golden age of creativity. The Spider-Verse films, The Boy and the Heron, and this year’s The Wild Robot are some of the best ever made in the genre, and that’s just the non-Disney ones! One of the very best in the last decade is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stunning stop-motion animated film from the good folks over at Laika Studios, who gave the world the modern goth girl classic Coraline. This one is just as good, and features the vocal talents of Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes, Matthew McConaughey, Rooney Mara, George Takei, and Art Parkinson as the 12-year-old title protagonist. In feudal Japan, the one-eyed Kubo is sent by his mother to a faraway land to flee his evil aunties and find his missing father’s armor. There, he teams up with Monkey, a snow monkey charm come to life, Little Hanzo, an origami figure resembling Kubo’s long-absent dad, and Beetle, a former samurai who cannot remember his past, to travel through strange lands and battle mystical creatures in an attempt to find the armor and avoid capture (or worse) from Kubo’s wicked extended family. As typical with movies like this, what Kubo finds instead is the value of friendship and the necessity of letting go of loved ones. The film features superb animation and a stirring score by Dario Marianelli, both of which create a colorful fantasy world that would impress even the most jaded cinephile. It’s a great kids film, yes, but it’s also a great film period, and all adults should watch Kubo and the Two Strings and ignite their imaginations once again. Kubo and the Two Strings is streaming on Netflix. As we move toward the end of the year, there are more and more reasons to stay indoors and watch a great movie. Amazon Prime Video has one of the best libraries of movies worth exploring, but if you find yourself stuck when deciding what to actually watch, you're not alone. A library as big as Amazon's can actually make deciding what to watch more difficult instead of easier. That's why we've rounded up three titles available on Prime Video that are the perfect way to spend the weekend. Anyone who loves movies likely holds The Shining, one of Jack Nicholson's best movies ever, in high regard. It's one of the most important horror movies ever made, and it's also a movie that was quite loosely adapted from its source material, a novel by Stephen King. The author has never been quiet about his dislike for the movie adaptation in spite of its popularity, and even wrote a sequel called Doctor Sleep that expanded on his version of the story. That novel eventually made its way to movie theaters, and it wasn't exactly a box office phenomenon. Before it leaves Amazon Prime Video at the end of the month, though, here are three reasons you should make time for it (the director's cut is particularly excellent). If you're a parent, you're likely always on the hunt for movies that you can watch with the whole family. As any parent knows, though, content that is great for kids is not necessarily also great for adults. It can be annoying, repetitive, or cloying, and kids tend to want to watch the same things over and over again. That's why we've curated a list of 10 family-friendly titles that will be great for both kids and their parents. These titles are available through services that are entirely free, so while they might come with some ads, they won't cost you anything to watch.

Commissioner Mark Uyeda defends the creation of regulatory sandboxes, as a CFTC committee advises usage of tokenized funds' shares as collateral for derivatives trading. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Following Donald Trump’s election as the new US President, regulators are pushing for crypto market reforms, from establishing regulatory sandboxes to allowing tokenized funds’ shares as collateral in traditional derivatives trading. During an interview for Fox Business, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said President-elect Donald Trump is right about stopping the war on crypto in the US. He also commented on what could be done to make the country a leader in the global crypto market According to Uyeda: “First off, from a regulatory perspective, we can provide proper clarity. Some crypto is not even a security at all, but we need to make it clear whether or not you would fall within SEC jurisdiction or not.” If a token offering falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction, clear guidelines are necessary so crypto firms can decide the right course of action to comply with the regulator’s rules. Uyeda also defended the creation of “safe harbors,” which are regulatory sandboxes where crypto companies could experiment with different products, allowing “innovation to occur.” The SEC Commissioner also argued that regulators must work with Congress and other federal agencies to create a cohesive approach to crypto. Lastly, considering Gary Gensler will step down as the SEC Chair on Jan. 20, Uyeda was asked if he is interested in filling the role, and he answered that this is a decision for the President. Uyeda’s call for reform comes amid a wider regulatory shift toward crypto and blockchain technology in finance. The CFTC recently recommended using tokenized funds as collateral. Bloomberg News reported on Nov. 22 that the Global Markets Advisory Committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved using tokenized assets, such as money-market fund tokens launched by BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, as collateral for derivatives trading. The committee’s recommendation, which now awaits review by the CFTC, highlights the potential for distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance the efficiency and transparency of collateral management. The advisory panel’s recommendation provides a framework for registered firms to hold and transfer tokenized non-cash collateral using distributed-ledger technology. The framework ensures compliance with existing margin requirements set by the CFTC, other U.S. regulators, and derivatives clearing organizations. Although the recommendations are not binding, the CFTC frequently incorporates advisory input into its policymaking due to the committees’ specialized expertise. However, there is no specific timeline for when or whether the CFTC will adopt these recommendations into formal guidance or rulemaking.

Samsung's second-tier OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata’s favorite TVs of the year. This QD-OLED panel boasts fabulously rich colors, can get slightly brighter than the LG C4, and has the perfect black levels and excellent picture quality from any angle that make OLED the dominant TV tech today. This TV has HDMI 2.1 support across all four inputs, and Samsung's Game Hub lets you stream from loads of services, including Xbox. The only obvious downside is the lack of Dolby Vision. You can find more options in our Best Early Black Friday TV Deals. Perhaps the best 4K streamer for folks who watch loads of Amazon Prime shows and movies, this Fire Stick is very easy to set up and use, supports Wi-Fi 6E for fast and stable streaming, and packs 16 gigabytes of storage. Alexa is built into the remote to help you find content or ask questions about what you’re watching. The picture-in-picture mode is handy for showing security cameras or controlling other smart home devices. There's also “Ambient Experience,” which cycles through art or nature scenes on your TV when you’re not watching something. The latest Apple Watch Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Apple Watch you can buy. It is an excellent fitness and health tracker, brings phone notifications and calls to your wrist, and works wonderfully well in concert with your iPhone. Sadly, it lacks blood oxygen sensing, and you'll still need to charge it every night. We don't see many deals on Apple's latest wares, so this is a discount worth grabbing if you're set on an Apple Watch. The Apple MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Apple laptop. WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar says it offers great performance for everyday tasks, has a bright display, and provides solid battery life. This lightweight device is the MacBook pick in our Best Laptops guide. The 15-inch model is also on sale at $1,044 ($255 off) and has a bigger display, better battery life, and more speakers, but is otherwise identical. These are the best trackers for folks with an iPhone, and you can use them to keep tabs on your keys, travel luggage, bike, or whatever else you worry might go missing. The location of each AirTag is marked clearly in the Find My app. The battery should last you a year, and we have a guide on how to replace your AirTag battery. Just please don’t use them to track people. This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. This is one of our favorite wireless chargers, but it is expensive, so this sale might be the perfect time to grab one. We recommend springing for the Qi2 version, as it will be compatible with the wave of Qi2 Android phones coming in 2025, but it also works with MagSafe iPhones (iPhone 13 models and newer support the Qi2 protocol). If you're just an iPhone person, the standard MagSafe version of this charger is also on sale for $77 ($33 off). Check out our Nomad Black Friday sale post for more deals. Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our best STEM toys for kids guide. My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast-charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately smitten to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the best MagSafe power banks. The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones, because it can fast-charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There used to be a subscription program where you sent the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, but it looks like that’s been axed in favor of using your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10 WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. This is Mill’s first-ever Black Friday sale, so if you were on the fence, this is the time to give it a shot. (Mill also offers a 90-day trial with free returns if you change your mind.) —Kat Merck As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck The best smart shades can be awfully expensive, but this clever retrofit gadget from Eve can make one of your existing roller blinds smart. Simply check compatibility by measuring the circumference of the tube inside your roller shade. This kit works with Matter, so you can use it with your platform of choice, but you do need a home hub (with Apple HomeKit, for example, that is a HomePod mini, HomePod, or Apple TV) if you want to schedule it to open and close automatically or use voice commands. Mine works perfectly, and I love the handy pull chain as a simple control backup, but it can be a little noisy. One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. This is one of the best sales we’ve seen on this boxy air purifier, which I’ve had in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove. I love that the slim profile and rectangular shape make this purifier easy to tuck away somewhere unobtrusive (though it still does need to be located 8 inches away from a wall), and that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro This cylindrical air purifier covers 2,745 square feet (at an air exchange rate of two times per hour, less than the recommended four, so we’d recommend a room half that size) with a 4-in-1 filter consisting of pre-filter, HEPA, activated carbon, and an antibacterial layer. Bosch came out with the Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the 1,300-square-foot main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s got a ring-light indicator (red = bad, blue = good) as well as a digital display that shows PM 2.5, total volatile organic compounds, temperature, and humidity. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck For folks with smaller homes, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum. It is very lightweight, easy to maneuver, and will pack away in a small space. It is also effective at keeping your place pristine, with a wide assortment of attachments to help you get into nooks and crannies. It even has a neon-green laser to shine a spotlight on every speck of dust you may have missed. As one of the best sleep trackers, the Withings Sleep Analyzer tracks your movements, breathing, and heart rate throughout the night, sending data to the Withings Health Mate app. Each morning you can review your sleep phases, broken into awake, REM, light, and deep sleep, and get a sleep score out of 100 based on duration, depth, regularity, interruptions, time to fall asleep, and time to get up. This mat slips under your mattress, making it a great sleep-tracking option for folks who don’t like to wear watches or rings in bed. This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating, so it can be used outdoors. What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away. This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. Arlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and a direct connection to Wi-Fi. That’s why the Arlo Pro 5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our best outdoor security cameras guide. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers excellent notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) that’s required for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3x zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8x hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 fps frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. Folks who receive loads of packages will appreciate Eufy’s dual camera doorbell because it provides a view of your porch floor and front step, alongside the usual picture of whoever is calling. This is the best subscription-free option in our best video doorbells guide because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording, and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. With a pleasing range of adjustments, including seat depth, recline level, and armrest length, this dependable office chair is easy to assemble. It can serve you well, no matter what height you are, and even boasts adjustable lumbar support, which is essential for folks who sit for hours every day. This is the lowest price we have seen yet on the best office chair for most people. Use code BFCM for 15 percent off. You can find more bargains in the Branch Black Friday sale. Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1-Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year), but it includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. This TP-Link mesh will cover your whole home on a limited budget (it’s the budget pick in our best mesh routers guide). It is a Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) that is easy to set up. It’s not the speediest mesh, but is fast enough for folks with internet connections of 500 Mbps or less. The vase-like design blends in easily on shelves or tables, and each router sports two gigabit Ethernet ports. For more than basic security and parental controls, you need Security+ at $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls at $3 a month or $18 a year). But, even with the subscriptions, the X20 is an affordable way to get reliable Wi-Fi. The Deco BE85 (7/10, WIRED Review) was TP-Link's first Wi-Fi 7 mesh. It delivers unrivaled performance, wide coverage, and is easy to set up and use. A two-pack will be enough for most folks, and each router has two 10-Gbps Ethernet ports, two 2.5-Gbps ports, and a USB 3.0 port. You need a very fast multi-gig internet connection and loads of Wi-Fi 7 devices to make this a worthwhile purchase, but it has dropped in price significantly since release. We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. If you want the top-of-the-line mesh system from Amazon’s Eero, it’s the Max 7. This tri-band system supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard. Each router can cover up to 2,500 square feet, and they have four Ethernet ports apiece, two rated at 10 Gbps and two at 2.5 Gbps. You can mix and match Eero routers, the app is very accessible, and this system is designed to be hands-off. It also boasts comprehensive smart home connectivity, and the optional Eero Plus subscription is pricey ($10 per month or $100 per year) but bundles parental controls, enhanced security, ad blocking, a password manager, and VPN service. Eero has worked out some of the kinks since I tested the Max 7 (7/10, WIRED Review), but it’s still likely overkill for most folks and more than you need to spend unless you have a big busy household with a multi-gig internet connection. Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. Some of the best wire-free earbuds you can get for under $100, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) impressed WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata with noise cancellation, detailed sound, multipoint pairing, and a wireless charging case at a very reasonable price. These earbuds are regularly discounted, but this is close to the lowest price we’ve seen. You can shrug off battery anxiety with the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless (10/10, WIRED Recommends), because this gaming headset can go for an amazing 300 hours between charges. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft said it delivers rich, booming sound, has comfortable ear cups, and boasts intuitive controls. All it really lacks is a headphone jack. Discounts are common on this headset, and it may have dipped slightly lower, but this is still a bargain worth grabbing. We think Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus is the best audiobook service, as it bundles a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, with one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Usually, you get one month free, after which it costs $15 per month, but any nonsubscriber can get three months for $1 until the end of the year. Remember that you get to keep titles purchased with credits, even after your subscription ends. Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap. Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano declared this uniquely shaped hair dryer as “made for curls” in our Best Hair Dryers guide. Basically a diffuser and dryer in one, it’s designed to dry curls gently while cutting down on frizz and puffiness. It doesn’t have a traditional handle, but that didn’t bother Medea. If you’re short on space in your bathroom and don’t want to have to store a hair dryer and separate diffuser attachment, this could be the solution for you. —Kat Merck As seen in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell is a fan of this two-in-one tourmaline ceramic hair straightener and curler that ranges from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit. The unique barrel has 88 little holes that blow cool air with the touch of a button, supposedly helping to set styles to last up to 48 hours. Nena did not find that her hair stayed curlier or straighter after using this feature, but this is still a decent deal on a unique tool for someone who may not want to have to store both a curling iron and a flat iron. —Kat Merck This OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-tos. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. I also like that it comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Black Friday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. And on the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site, and while testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck We love Cozy Earth’s bamboo sheets and hoodies, but this pajama set hits new comfort highs—soft and stretchy, smooth and luxurious. My wife has been wearing these pajamas to test them for an upcoming gift guide, and she says they are the best she has ever worn. The big catch with Cozy Earth clothing is the high prices, so this Black Friday sale offering up to 35 percent off is worth a look. The sale price is only on select colors of these pajamas. The Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite phones of the year. WIRED Senior Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu raves about the camera system, smooth OLED displays, and helpful software features you won’t find on other phones. Easily one of the best Android phones you can buy right now, the Pixel 9 Pro only dropped recently, so this is a surprisingly deep and tempting discount. The Pixel 8A is also discounted at $399 ($100 off). This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It is a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. The Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a good-looking smartwatch with accurate health and fitness capabilities. The bigger 45-mm size offers a day or more of battery life, and the Auto Bedtime Mode is handy when the day is over. This is our pick of the best smartwatches if you have an Android phone, and this is the lowest price we have seen for it yet. Discounts on Oura’s biohacking smart rings are rare, but the Oura Ring Gen3 Horizon dropped in price when the Oura Ring 4 landed, and this discount takes it even lower. This smart ring is our favorite sleep tracker and does a solid job of tracking your activity and stress levels. It packs three hospital-grade sensors: infrared photoplethysmography sensors for heart rate and respiration, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensor for body temperature, and a 3D accelerometer for movement. The app is easy to use, but Oura’s $6-per-month membership is an essential extra cost to get the most from this gadget. This easy-to-build home arcade cabinet features a 17-inch color LCD screen, a light-up marquee, authentic arcade controls, and runs 14 Namco games, including every version of Pac-Man and a few extras like Galaga and Dig Dug. Whether you grew up in the arcades or not, these games still have a powerful addictive hook, and this Pac-Man arcade machine brought me closer to my teen kids. This is a decent discount that drops it to the lowest price we’ve seen. This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. REI's Half Dome tents are some of the best camping tents you can buy, according to WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson, who says this tent is reasonably priced, rugged, and simple to set up, and it offers generous living space for two with gear. The interchangeable poles make for an easy pitch, and it won't add too much weight to your pack, at just under 4 pounds. Happy campers will find more options in our Best REI Black Friday Deals post. Now is the time to procure the best face computer. The Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses are on sale across Meta, Ray-Ban, Best Buy, Target, and Amazon through December 2. I freaking love these things (possibly because I’ve been wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarers for almost two decades) and they’re so useful. You can listen to podcasts on your run! You can take pictures to text to your spouse! You can check if the food cart is open, all without taking out your phone. And as if that weren’t enough, they also shade your eyes. —Adrienne So Universal travel adapters are handy to have on your travels and this affordable adapter from Epicka works in more than 150 countries. Sliders reveal common international plugs for the EU, UK, and US, but you can rotate the pins for sockets in Australia or China. You can plug in power-hungry devices, like laptops and camera batteries, but there are also four USB-A ports on the bottom and a 15-watt USB-C port on the side for phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other small gadgets. It’s not the sturdiest option, but it's cheaper than most of the alternatives. This is the budget pick in our best travel adapters guide and is frequently discounted, but well worth buying at this price. It's described as a men’s travel backpack, but we think anyone will find this bag useful for all kinds of trips. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has been using it for six years and loves the storable backpack straps, padded handles, and plethora of pockets. She says it is comfortable and breathable if you're carrying it on your back, and it sports a padded compartment for your laptop, tablet, e-reader, or Nintendo Switch. This may have dipped a couple of bucks lower before. An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck This super svelte smart wallet is durable and provides easy and swift access to your cards, thanks to a trigger button that pops them out of the top. It is made from recycled aluminum and holds four regular cards easily, though you can add more cards or cash using the band around the outside. Ekster also offers a ton of optional add-ons, including a tracker card and a multi-tool. I also love the Ekster Wallet at $62 ($27 off), and the Ekster Grid Backpack for $180 ($45 off) was the perfect way to travel light on my last work trip. Read next Read next

The top 10 performing stocks in the S&P 500 index saw returns of 18% or more since Election Day, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, which analyzed returns based on closing prices from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20. Two companies — Axon Enterprise (AXON), which provides law-enforcement technology, and Tesla (TSLA), the electric-vehicle maker led by Elon Musk, an advisor to President-elect Donald Trump — saw their stocks gain more than 35%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. By contrast, the S&P 500 gained about 2% over the same period. Investors should be cautious about buying individual stocks based on short-term boosts, said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, Inc., which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "It's usually a bad idea," Goldberg said. "Momentum is a powerful force in the market, but relying solely on short-term price moves as an investment strategy is risky." Investors should understand what's driving the movement and whether the factors pushing up a stock price are sustainable, Goldberg said. Lofty stock returns were partly driven by Trump administration policy stances expected to benefit certain companies and industries, investment experts said. Deregulation and a softer view toward mergers and acquisitions are two "key" themes driving bullish sentiment after Trump's win, said Jacob Manoukian, head of U.S. investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Take the energy sector. Analysts expect the Trump administration will be more likely to greenlight oil and gas projects, for example. Trump has called for increasing fossil-fuel production and reversing Biden-era policies to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. He picked Chris Wright, CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy, to head the Department of Energy. More from Personal Finance:The must-have gift of the season may be a 'dupe'Could Trump reinstate the student debt Biden forgave?Most employees don't use this 'triple-tax-free' account EQT Corporation (EQT) — among the biggest U.S. natural gas producers — saw its stock surge 24% from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. It's an example of a company that benefited from the "Trump momentum for energy," Goldberg said. Additionally, U.S. regulators will likely be much less stringent about allowing potential mergers during Trump's second term, experts said. Companies in the streaming ecosystem — like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which owns the Max streaming service, and Disney+ owner The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) — may be benefactors of looser rules around consolidation, they said. For some stocks, outperformance was tied to rosy quarterly earnings results or guidance that some companies reported around or after Election Day, experts said. Many such businesses cited artificial intelligence as a growth driver. For example, Palantir Technologies (PLTR), cited "unprecedented" demand for its AI platform in the third quarter, helping deliver "exceptionally strong" earnings, Treasurer and CFO David Glazer told investors Nov. 4. Likewise, Axon beat analysts' estimates in its Nov. 7 earnings results, with officials touting its "AI era plan" and raising earnings guidance, Goldberg said. Axon and Palantir stocks were up 38% and 22%, respectively, from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Some companies benefited from a combination of policy and earnings, experts said. Take Vistra Corp. (VST), an energy provider, for example. The company's stock jumped 27% after Election Day. Vistra is in talks with large data centers — or "hyperscalers" — in Texas, Pennsylvania and Ohio to build or upgrade gas and nuclear plants, Stacey Doré, Vistra's chief strategy and sustainability officer, said on the company's Q3 earnings call Nov. 7. Tech companies are building more and more such data centers to fuel the AI revolution — and need to source increasing amounts of energy to run them. And then there's the Elon Musk factor. Tesla's stock got an "Elon Musk premium" from Trump's victory, said Goldberg of Professional Advisory Services. Musk, Tesla's CEO, was one of Trump's top campaign backers. Trump tapped him to co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker soared 14% the day after the election and almost 30% by week's end. But Tesla stock has additional tailwinds, experts said. For one, Trump wants to end a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs. Scrapping that policy is expected to hurt Tesla's EV rivals. Tesla has also been developing technology for driverless vehicles. In Tesla's recent earnings call, Musk said he'd use his influence in Trump's administration to establish a "federal approval process for autonomous vehicles." Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Justices dismiss Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data breach dispute

This morning the justices dismissed Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank as “improvidently granted” – that is, without issuing a ruling on the merits, and instead signaling that it was a mistake to grant review. The brief unsigned order leaves in place a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that allowed a securities fraud class action against Meta to go forward on the theory that Facebook’s disclosures improperly downplayed the risks of a data breach to shareholders. The company had disclosed the risk of hypothetical future data breaches, which shareholders argue violated securities law because Cambridge Analytica had already exploited the data of millions of users. When Cambridge’s misuse of user data later became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell dramatically. At the oral argument, even the more conservative justices seemed skeptical of Facebook’s arguments, so its failure to persuade a majority to rein in the lower court is not surprising. At this point, the case will return to the lower courts, where the action will proceed against Meta.

Title: 3 Nvidia customers have each spent $10 billion on chips this year

Time Published: 2024-11-22T18:25:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) path to becoming the most valuable public company in the world this year has been laid by its artificial intelligence chips and a handful of anonymous customers. Earlier this week, the chipmaker reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations. According to the company’s Form 10-Q, 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — came from only three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, the filing said. The filing also shows that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. That means Customers B and C have each spent around $10 billion on Nvidia’s tech so far this year, while Customer D has spent almost $11 billion. Nvidia reported revenues of $26 billion for the fiscal first quarter, and $30 billion for the fiscal second quarter. The sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to the filing. In September, Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing showed four anonymous customers made up nearly half of its $30 billion revenues for the second fiscal quarter. Sales from the four customers represented about 46% of total quarterly revenue, or $13.8 billion. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in both 10-Q filings. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.74%), Meta (META-0.73%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.01%), and Tesla (TSLA+3.75%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. Nvidia’s record fiscal third-quarter revenue was up 94% from a year ago. The company set its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which was slightly above expectations.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market. Growth Investment Ratio: 112% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) is an upstream semiconductor company that provides the building blocks of chip design to firms such as NVIDIA and AMD. This provides it with a key role in the ongoing rush of artificial intelligence since these building blocks are indispensable for any chip design. However, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)’s shares are up by a modest 14.9% year to date primarily due to the firm’s exposure to the broader semiconductor industry and not just AI chips. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) has missed analyst guidance for several quarters this year, and this led to its shares being down 3.8% prior to the third quarter earnings. However, Q3 was a reversal in fortune, as the stock soared by 12.5% in its aftermath. This was on the back of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) raised its full-year profit per share forecast to $5.90 over the previous $5.87 on the back of AI-related tailwinds. Subsequently, any AI demand materializing or a recovery in the broader chip sector should benefit the firm. Artisan Partners mentioned Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Bottom contributors to performance for the quarter included semiconductor design and simulation company Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS). Cadence declined due to weaker-than-expected guidance, sensitivity to Cadence’s hardware product cycle in the near term, and uncertainty around China exposure.” Overall, CDNS ranks 15th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of CDNS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CDNS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Full Content:
US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took in $1 billion in daily total net inflows yesterday as Bitcoin inched closer to the $100k mark. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw the most inflows, attracting $608.41 million, according to SoSoValue data. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $300.95 million. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF brought in $68 million and Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB attracted $17.18 million. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only one with negative net flows, recording $7.8 million outflows. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs have earned a combined $30.35 billion since launching in January following approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Elevated trade among the spot Bitcoin ETFs followed as Bitcoin climbed to the $100k mark on November 22, continuing its bull run. The inflows also come after BlackRock launched its options contracts earlier this week. During trading on day one, BlackRock’s options brought in nearly $2 billion, helping to push Bitcoin to more than $94,000. Grayscale announced this week that it was also launching Bitcoin ETF options following BlackRock’s impressive debut and a surge in investor interest. As trade continues through spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s becoming clear that these avenues are one of the main ways for investors to hold Bitcoin. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, US Bitcoin ETFs hit $100 billion in assets, adding on X: “They’re now 97% of [the] way to passing Satoshi as [the] biggest holder and 82% of [the] way to passing gold ETFs.” Speaking of "100" milestones, the US bitcoin ETFs hit $100b in assets (altho more like $104b given the price surge overnight) w/ YTD flows flirting with $30b (double our estimate). They're now 97% of way to passing Satoshi as biggest holder and 82% of way to passing gold ETFs. pic.twitter.com/Y3070yW7Jx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2024 Elsewhere, in the market, Ethereum is up by more than 7% over the past week at $3,285, Solana has seen a nearly 20% increase at $253, and XRP has risen close to 60% to $1.44 in the same time, according to CoinMarketCap.

Title: Deribit Exchange announces integration of Ethena’s USDe as margin collateral
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/deribit-exchange-announces-integration-of-ethenas-usde-as-margin-collateral/
Time Published: 2024-11-22T15:55:48Z
Full Content:
In a groundbreaking move for the cryptocurrency derivatives market, Deribit, one of the world’s largest crypto derivatives exchanges, has revealed plans to integrate Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, into its cross-collateral pool. This integration, set to launch in early January 2025, is contingent upon receiving regulatory approval. Ethena’s USDe, a synthetic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, offers unique decentralized backing through delta-hedging derivatives in perpetual and futures markets. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by physical reserves, USDe’s innovative model enhances decentralization while maintaining stability. The integration with Deribit promises to unlock new possibilities for traders. According to Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs, this initiative will pave the way for “completely new structured product use cases” that were previously unattainable with conventional stablecoin collateral. Young emphasized the significance of this development, stating that Deribit’s dominant market share—over 85% in the cryptocurrency options space—positions the platform as a pivotal venue for USDe adoption. As part of the integration, users will be able to use USDe as margin collateral and earn rewards, adding to its utility within the trading ecosystem. This announcement marks another milestone for Ethena, as other major exchanges, including Bitget and Gate, have also begun incorporating USDe into their platforms. The integration has already impacted Ethena’s ecosystem, with its governance token, ENA, experiencing a notable price surge. After the announcement, ENA’s value rose by 13% to reach an intraday high of $0.63. Although the token has pulled back to around $0.5896, the token has gained approximately 62% over the past month, reflecting growing confidence in Ethena’s innovative financial products. Ethena Labs, founded in 2023, continues to expand its offerings, including its recently announced stablecoin project, UStb (USTB), developed in collaboration with BlackRock and Securitize. The partnership with Deribit underscores Ethena’s commitment to bridging traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. With Deribit’s backing and increasing market interest, USDe is poised to redefine margin trading dynamics, signalling a significant step forward for both crypto-native and traditional finance participants.

Title: Grindr Inc. (GRND): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grindr-inc-grnd-bull-case-155509680.html
Time Published: 2024-11-22T15:55:09Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Grindr Inc. (GRND) on Value Zoomer’s Substack by Myles Kuah. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRND. Grindr Inc. (GRND)'s share was trading at $14.93 as of Nov 21st. GRND’s trailing P/E was 134.66 according to Yahoo Finance. lazyllama/Shutterstock.com Grindr has emerged as a standout business within the dating app industry, distinguished by its unique market positioning and strong financial performance. Unlike traditional dating apps, Grindr operates as a gay hookup platform, allowing users to connect with others nearby without requiring a mutual match. This innovative design, paired with features like advanced filters, paid subscriptions, and ad-supported free use, creates a compelling user experience that drives engagement and monetization. Its dominance in the LGBTQ+ niche, supported by unmatched brand recognition and network effects, positions Grindr as the clear leader in its segment. Grindr benefits from an expanding target market as 11% of Gen Z men identify as LGBTQ+, compared to 5% of millennials and 3% of Gen X. This demographic also boasts higher disposable incomes due to fewer financial obligations, making it an attractive and profitable customer base. Furthermore, Grindr’s focus on casual connections, rather than relationships, ensures consistent user activity and enhances the value of its paid features. The platform’s ability to cater to the fluid dynamics of gay attraction gives it a competitive edge, particularly for users seeking specific preferences or experiences. From a financial perspective, Grindr is highly efficient, with revenue growing at 35% annually and operating margins of 20%. The company’s return on invested capital hovers near 40%, reflecting its asset-light business model. Recent refinancing efforts have reduced interest expenses, enabling Grindr to allocate more resources toward growth and debt reduction. Although the company carries $300 million in debt, its robust free cash flow generation positions it well to manage and reduce this liability. Valuation remains a critical factor, with Grindr trading at a P/E of nearly 60, factoring in its outstanding warrants. While this valuation underscores its growth potential, it leaves little room for error. Investors remain cautious about management, citing concerns over promotional behavior and the CEO’s involvement in a prior SPAC-backed company that ultimately filed for bankruptcy. Despite these risks, Grindr’s dominant market position, scalable business model, and expanding customer base present significant long-term opportunities. A more attractive entry point could unlock value for investors willing to capitalize on this high-quality business. Grindr Inc. (GRND) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 21 hedge fund portfolios held GRND at the end of the third quarter which was 27 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRND as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GRND but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The dividend yield on the S&P 500 is very low these days. Because of that, you won't generate much passive dividend income by investing in an S&P 500 index fund. While the S&P 500 doesn't pay much these days, plenty of other dividend stocks pay a lot more. Nvidia isn't the only amazing stock performer out there. Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors just scooped up 11 million shares of a semiconductor stock not named Nvidia. The Oracle of Omaha has concentrated Berkshire's investment portfolio in his best ideas. Rather than feeling surprised, you should take advantage of such scenarios to scoop up solid growth stocks on the cheap. Ideally, these businesses should be growing their revenue and profits and generating positive free cash flow. Most importantly, these growth stocks should possess catalysts that help them post sustainable growth in the years ahead. Warren Buffett continued to sell Apple during the third quarter, but that wasn't his most surprising move -- not by a long shot. Dalio is piling into artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired stock Palantir Technologies, and dumped shares of a media company with an impenetrable moat. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the most-watched companies on the planet right now, thanks to its dominance in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant holds an 80% share of the AI chip market, and this has translated into triple-digit revenue growth for its data center business quarter after quarter. This market powerhouse once again surpassed analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share, delivered record revenue, and maintained gross margin of more than 74%. Earnings move stocks in the stock market. Looking at annual growth rates and MarketSurge's earnings lines can help you spot leaders. PepsiCo has increased its dividend annually for over five decades, making it a Dividend King. The company's dividend yield is currently around 3.4%, which is near the highest levels seen over the past 40 years or so. In other words, it looks like a fallen angel, which means it is a good company facing temporary challenges. Sign in to access your portfolio

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 250 points or 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped between positive and negative territory, after the major gauges closed Thursday in the green. Markets are regrouping after Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings fell short of definitively settling the question of whether AI would keep boosting stocks. Some of the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacap stocks were under pressure in early trading, also dogged by the potential breakup of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).T The major gauges are still on track to close the week with wins of over 1%, despite getting it off to a lackluster start as the post-election rally stalled. Wall Street is still waiting to learn who Trump will tap for his Treasury Secretary — an announcement that could sway markets, given its importance to the economy. The President-elect tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to be the US attorney general after his prior pick, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday. Meanwhile, surging bitcoin continued to near the landmark $100,000 level, buoyed by growing confidence that the Trump administration will support pro-crypto policies. The leading token broke above $99,500 early on Friday before retreating amid hopes for looser regulatory oversight after SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he will step down soon.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. is offering 7.8 million shares for $145.38 to $148.54 each, which would be valued at as much as $1.2 billion. That price range represented as much as an 8% discount on Reddit's closing price Thursday of $158.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) stepped above the flat line. Stocks wavered at the open on Friday, but the major averages were still on track to end the week with wins.

Bitcoin climbed above $99,400 early on Friday before retreating. The cryptocurrency has been on fire since Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month, amid optimism that his incoming administration will implement crypto-friendly policies.

Title: SMCI Shares Soar 15.1% Amid Auditor Appointment and Regulatory Resolution

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financial) stock price rose by 15.1% to $29.70 on November 21, 2024, following a series of significant developments. This marked a remarkable recovery and restored investor confidence despite ongoing controversies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. The recent surge is coming into the market after SMCI cleared all the compliance issues between it and Nasdaq by appointing BDO USA as their new auditors. This action comes after a somewhat volatile time for the company, which saw its financial reports delayed and the ouster of its prior auditor, Ernst & Young. The appointment of BDO, the fifth largest accounting firm globally, alongside presenting a compliance plan, helped the company put off immediate wipe-out risks, which was a significant achievement in stabilization. The semiconductor industry has received further support from Nvidia's (NVDA, Financial) Q3, FY 2025 results, which depict a healthy demand for AI. Nvidia's results reflected strong revenue and earnings growth and placed a favorable spotlight on system partners such as SMCI. Although Nvidia shares declined on profit selling, the prolonged favorable industry fundamentals and the increase continued driving up the SMCI shares. However, coupled with these developments are some challenges that Super Micros is experiencing, some of which are the accounting fraud allegations made by Hindenburg research early this year. The ability of the company to address these issues while sustaining solid linkages is likely to continue to be an area of interest to investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. The legendary investor reduced his stake is some very well-known companies. An incoming crypto-friendly regulatory environment for U.S. based companies has renewed optimism for certain tokens, especially XRP. Rather than feeling surprised, you should take advantage of such scenarios to scoop up solid growth stocks on the cheap. Ideally, these businesses should be growing their revenue and profits and generating positive free cash flow. Most importantly, these growth stocks should possess catalysts that help them post sustainable growth in the years ahead. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is reporting tremendous demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). It supplies these chips for gaming, data centers, automotive, and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. All that demand is generating plenty of excess revenue for Nvidia and the company is looking for ways to put that money to good use. This eVTOL aircraft maker could have a bright future. Nowhere is that more apparent than the stunning rise of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, a collection known for its strong ties to the technology. Billionaire investors have taken notice, and many hold positions in the Magnificent Seven stocks. Among these closely watched billionaires is Philippe Laffont, who made a name for himself by building Coatue Management into the world's best-known tech-centric hedge fund, parlaying a $50 million investment in 1999 into $27 billion in assets under management. BioLineRx (BLRX) and Ayrmid, the parent company of Gamida Cell (GMDA), announced that the companies entered into a license agreement for motixafortide, BioLineRx’s FDA-approved stem cell mobilization agent indicated in combination with filgrastim for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, BioLineRx granted Ayrmid an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Aphexda across all indications, excluding solid tumo Rising costs of living and shrinking savings force millions of Americans to consider retiring overseas. Last year, data from the Social Security Administration showed that about 450,000 people received benefits outside the U.S. as of the end of 2021, ... W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC) currently sits more than 15% below its 52-week high. The weakness in its share price is a big reason the real estate investment trust (REIT) offers a dividend yield above 6%. The diversified REIT's high-yielding dividend should steadily rise in the future. Three brand-name businesses are perfectly positioned to become Wall Street's premier stock splits in the new year.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. Merely days after Donald Trump won a tightly-contested election for the top office in the US, Elon Musk, one of his most prominent backers, received further good news as xAI, the AI startup he founded in 2023, raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks. Potomac Wealth Advisors president Mark Avallone joined CNBC's 'The Exchange' on November 16 to discuss where he sees investing opportunities following Trump's election. He believes investing in the tech sector makes the most sense given the implications of the 2024 election results for the financial markets. He noted that the election has shifted the underlying dynamics affecting businesses, particularly regarding regulation and taxation. The new administration has changed the previous climate of heightened regulation and discussions around increasing capital gains and corporate taxes. Avallone believes that the potential for reduced regulation and lower taxes on corporations could create a more favorable environment for business growth. He emphasized that corporate America’s ability to deliver earnings will be crucial, relying on continued efficiencies and advancements in technology. This perspective supports his thesis that investing in technology remains a sound strategy for investors. When discussing specific stocks, Avallone highlighted major tech companies from the MAG7 as particularly attractive. He expressed confidence that the current administration would foster a more supportive environment for these companies, allowing them to thrive. Avallone also touched on the defense sector, which has historically benefited from global conflicts. He pointed out that defense companies have shown resilience and believes that ongoing global tensions will sustain demand for defense stocks, providing a hedge against market volatility. However, Avallone expressed caution regarding the healthcare sector, which has been lagging due to heavy regulation and political scrutiny. He noted that despite an aging population driving demand for medical equipment, regulatory pressures have hindered growth in this area. Overall, his analysis underscores a cautious optimism about investing in technology and defense while highlighting potential challenges within healthcare as businesses navigate the post-election landscape. Methodology We sifted through Finviz to compile a list of 30 NASDAQ stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 12 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A scientist in a lab coat observing a beaker with colored liquid as it bubbles and hisses. Average Upside Potential as of November 21: 185.26% Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative oral treatments for chronic metabolic and pulmonary conditions with significant unmet medical needs. Its lead product candidate, GPCR-01, is an oral therapy aimed at treating obesity and related metabolic disorders. The company recently announced its third-quarter 2024 financial results and corporate updates. It reported a strong financial position as of September 30, with $915.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This substantial funding is projected to sustain operations and key clinical milestones, including all GSBR-1290 studies necessary for Phase 3 readiness, until at least 2027. It announced positive developments for GSBR-1290. This oral small molecule targets the GLP-1 receptor and holds promise as a treatment for obesity. The company initiated a comprehensive development program for GSBR-1290, which includes two Phase 2 clinical trials: ACCESS and ACCESS II. These studies aim to determine optimal dosing strategies and evaluate the drug's effectiveness in adults with obesity or overweight and weight-related health problems. The first patients have already been enrolled in the ACCESS trial, with the expectation of including higher dosage groups in ACCESS II by year-end. Topline data from both studies is anticipated in late 2025. While Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) has other programs targeting obesity and related conditions, the focus is clearly on GSBR-1290's progress. This suggests it's the company's most promising candidate at this stage. Overall, this progress reveals that it's well-positioned for success in the industry. Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: “Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) is a biotechnology company dedicated to making oral small molecule medicines to target the obesity and diabetes market. Recent share weakness has been due to two large pharmaceutical acquisitions in the space: Roche’s purchase of Carmot and AstraZeneca’s in-licensing of Eccogene’s GLP-1 asset. These developments were followed by updates from Structure that implied it had a promising asset, but it might be inferior to Eli Lilly’s first-in-class product. Shares fell as analysts reduced the probability of success surrounding potential peak sales. We think it is too early to reach a final conclusion on the company’s oral small molecule GLP-1, as these data sets are limited in total sample size, and there are compelling arguments for both sides. Given how quickly this space changes and our smaller position sizing due to the aforementioned dynamics, we are monitoring our position and making decisions based on our evolving analysis. Overall GPCR ranks 2nd on our list of the NASDAQ stocks with biggest upside potential according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GPCR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GPCR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Fiji’s ‘vulnerable’ comments add needle to Ireland clash – Caelan Doris??????????????
URL: https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/fijis-vulnerable-comments-add-needle-to-ireland-clash-caelan-doris/a210016704.html
Time Published: 2024-11-22T12:41:09Z
Full Content:
Caelan Doris says Ireland will be fired up to take down Fiji on Saturday. Photo by Seb Daly/Sportsfile Ireland captain Caelan Doris admits the comments from the Fiji camp that Ireland are “vulnerable” adds needle to tomorrow’s Autumn Nations Series game at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm). Fiji have never beaten Ireland in their previous five meetings while Ireland will look to record their second win of this international window. Fiji scrum-half Frank Lomani described Andy Farrell’s team as being “so vulnerable that we as a team and as a group we can counter that”. Fiji come into this game after recording their first ever win on Welsh soil with a 24-19 win in Cardiff two weeksSa ago while they beat Spain 33-19 last Saturday. Doris agrees the “vulnerable” description add a bit more spice to tomorrow’s encounter. “Yeah I think so. I mean we definitely respect them, how they play. The two things you look at are their pace and their skillset, the way they throw the ball around, but also they’re a very powerful team,” Doris said after today’s Captains Run at the Aviva Stadium. “It’s going to be a very physical game. I remember the one a couple of years back for how physical it was. It’s going to be the same tomorrow and looking forward to the challenge of that. “I think they'll probably be confident based off a couple of their results and how they've gone against Wales and Spain last week.” Even though Ireland conceded 13 penalties for the second week in a row last week (as well as two yellow cards in their win over Argentina), Doris says belief is still high in the camp. "If it's off the discipline they're looking at, I'm not sure exactly, but there's a lot of belief within our camp still. We feel we have the right people showing us the way and there's excitement about what we can do. The discipline has obviously been talked about a lot and it's been an area that has been very good for us historically, so we're looking forward to getting back on track there tomorrow.” Doris’ Leinster team-mate Gus McCarthy will make his international debut at hooker while Ulster back-rower Cormac Izuchukwu starts at blindside flanker in his first cap. What’s the message to the new players? “Enjoy it is the big one that we always speak about. The two lads in particular getting their debuts this week, they're pretty calm and confident players and people anyway. They've come in pretty seamlessly,” Doris added. “You look at Gus in particular, who's only 21, and he's a had a pretty steep rise from captaining Blackrock a couple of years ago to 20s to Leinster to Emerging Ireland, so he's had a pretty seamless transition the whole way and he's settled in really well in the group, trained really well and he's got his well-deserved opportunity now. “And Izzy as well has showed his class, he's gone on a bit of a longer journey through the sevens and whatnot and then he's showed his class in Ulster over the last season or so. I feel they're definitely both ready and I'm looking forward to seeing how they go tomorrow.”

Title: Goldman Sachs: eBay Inc. (EBAY) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up view of a customers phone, using the mobile app to buy products. Growth Investment Ratio: 71% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a well-known e-commerce retailer that has been operating since the start of the dotcom era of the 1990s. However, unlike Amazon, the firm’s decision to focus primarily on third-party sellers and not bulk merchants has meant that it has been unable to grow to Amazon’s scale. Yet, like Amazon and other retailers, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) also depends on high volumes to drive margins and earn profit. The firm has undertaken a new strategy to attract high-spenders to its platform by offering them hard-to-find items and then retaining them by offering other products. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is also expanding its consumer-to-consumer business model globally to drive volumes in its marketplace. Subsequently, this strategy is now central to the firm’s hypothesis and should influence the share price. The strategy also tends to perform well in an economy where inflation is slowing. As a result, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) could see tailwinds in the future contingent on successful management execution. During the Q3 2024 earnings call eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s management shared details for its new strategy. Here is what they said: “One of the key building blocks underpinning our return to positive GMV growth has been our geo-specific investment, where we leverage our innovation playbook from focused categories to better serve customer needs at the local level. While many of these product experience changes benefit all sellers and buyers, we are particularly focused on consumer-to-consumer or C2C sellers for several reasons. C2C sellers bring some of the most unique inventory to eBay and are typically less price sensitive than B2C sellers. C2C sellers accelerate e-commerce as roughly 60% of their GMV comes from used and refurbished items compared to 40% for our marketplace overall. Overall, EBAY ranks 33rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of EBAY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EBAY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Happy Friday! If you're doing food shopping for Thanksgiving this weekend, you might notice prices feel better … sort of. The cost of Thanksgiving dinner has fallen for the second year in a row. But it's still 19% more expensive than it was in 2019, according to one survey of grocery store prices. In today's big story, billionaire Ken Griffin has some advice for President-elect Donald Trump, including a suggestion for his Treasury pick. What's on deck: But first, can I give you a tip? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of Wall Street's most powerful people offered advice to the president-elect. Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the $65 billion hedge fund Citadel, called for some restraint from Donald Trump regarding policies implemented around immigration and inflation, write Business Insider's Bradley Saacks and Michelle Abrego. While speaking Thursday at the Economic Club of New York, Griffin said he appreciates the importance of those issues to Americans but said aggressive tactics to address them could make things worse. Griffin is one of the biggest donors to the Republican Party, but declined to publicly endorse either presidential candidate this year. Moderation hasn't been the name of the game for Trump with some of his proposed policies. The president-elect promised mass deportations of immigrants in the US illegally and wide-ranging tariffs of at least 10-20% on all imported goods. Griffin said the US should remain a place for ambitious immigrants to find work and warned cutting taxes poses a risk for a government holding so much debt. At a conference just a few blocks away, Pimco CEO Manny Roman also raised the issue of taking a tough stance on immigration amid a tight labor market. Griffin's advice for Trump didn't stop at his policies. He also made a suggestion for the future president's all-important Treasury secretary pick: Apollo CEO Marc Rowan. "Please take the job," Griffin said of Rowan. Griffin also might be looking for some advice. He said he'd be open to selling a minority stake in his hedge fund to the right partner. While Citadel still operates as a private partnership, Griffin sold a stake worth more than $1 billion in sister company Citadel Securities in 2022 to VC firms Sequoia and Paradigm. The relationship has been a massive success, according to Griffin, with the two firms helping Citadel Securities with "real insights" into managing its rapid growth. Almost a quarter of all US equity market volume is handled by Citadel Securities. Hedge funds selling off stakes of their firm are having a bit of a moment these days. Millennium Management, another multistrategy giant in the hedge fund world, is reportedly in early talks to get an investment from BlackRock.

Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more In The Irish Times tomorrow, there is an interview with award-winning children’s author Martin Waddell, who next week will be inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Irish Book Awards. Reviews are Anthony Roche on Nicholas Grene’s Irish Theatre in the Twenty-First Century; Neil Hegarty on Ulster 1912-22: change, controversy and conflict, co-edited by Brian Walker and Alan Parkinson; Declan O’Driscoll on The City and Its Uncertain Walls by Haruki Murakami; Claire Hennessy on the best new YA fiction; Siobhán Long on Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin: A Life in Music; Donald Clarke on Box Office Poison by Tim Robey; and Adrian Frazier on Derek Mahon: A Retrospective, edited by Nicholas Grene and Tom Walker. This weekend’s Irish Times Eason offer is Think Twice by Harlan Coben, just €5.99, a €6 saving. Waterstones has announced Long Island by Colm Tóibín, the follow-up to Brooklyn, as its Irish Book of the Year. Tóibín is the current Laureate for Irish Fiction and the author of 10 previous novels, three of which were nominated for the Booker Prize, two collections of stories and many works of non-fiction. The author said: “I worked slowly and tentatively on ‘Long Island’. I followed my instinct but I was never sure. So it makes a big difference now that this novel ‘Long Island’ is Waterstone’s Irish Book of the Year. It cheers me up and makes me feel that maybe I did something right.” Lily Keohane, Waterstones Irish commercial manager, said: “We’ve been spoiled for choice after yet another outstanding year of Irish writing, with new novels by Sally Rooney, Kevin Barry and Booker longlisted Colin Barrett’s debut to name only a few. But the true standout of the year has to be Colm Tóibín’s masterpiece, Long Island. This deceptively quiet novel full of longing, reconnection, and the joy of love rediscovered is the work of a writer at the height of his considerable powers. For many this is a return to already beloved characters and for others it’s an opportunity to discover one of Ireland’s finest writers for the first time.” * Question 7 by Richard Flanagan has won the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction 2024. The winner was announced by chair of judges, Isabel Hilton, at a ceremony in London. Flanagan becomes the first author to win both the Booker Prize for Fiction and the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, an achievement that affirms him as one of the most significant and acclaimed writers in the English language. Beginning at a love hotel by Japan’s Inland Sea and ending by a river in Tasmania, Question 7 is about the choices we make about love and the chain reaction that follows. Exploring the value of life, Flanagan tackles far-ranging seemingly disparate personal and historical topics, from H.G. Wells’ affair with Rebecca West, to the atomic bomb and his own near-death experience, expertly documenting life’s chain reaction: from past to present to future. * Tyrone translator Ellen Corbett has made history as the first Irish person to win the Stephen Spender Prize for poetry translation. Corbett’s translation of Laoighseach Ní Choistealbha’s Irish-language poem, Scrúdú (Exam), took the top honour in the Open Category, a significant achievement marking the first Irish-language win since 2012. The prize, awarded by the Stephen Spender Trust, is the leading global prize for poetry translation, and for the second year, is now open to entrants worldwide. Judged by British-Bahraini poet Taher Adel, poet and academic Jennifer Wong, and poet Keith Jarrett, the prize offers entrants the opportunity to translate poetry from any language into English. This year, Corbett’s translation stood out among the 1,000 entries from more than 100 languages, with several of her translations making it to the final stages of the judging process. Reflecting on her win, Corbett shared, “It is a huge honour to have won first place for Laoighseach’s poem. I’m absolutely thrilled and hope this will inspire greater interest in Irish-language poetry, especially in emerging poets.” Corbett, a PhD researcher at Ulster University, has dedicated much of her academic work to modern Irish-language poetry and translation studies, and aims to encourage young translators across Ireland to consider creative translation as a career path. Ní Choistealbha, an Irish-language poet from Co Donegal now living and working in Galway, expressed delight in seeing her work in English for the first time. “Obviously it’s a massive privilege to have one’s work translated at all, it’s also very interesting to have your work translated back into your own native language. Irish is my second language and I primarily write through Irish, but English is my first language. It’s almost like a revelation. The poem has a second life that in some ways resonates even more with your own life.” Both poet and translator look forward to future collaboration, with more translations already in the pipeline. For Corbett, “the Stephen Spender Prize has made me realise that I could have a future as a literary translator alongside my research. It feels as though there are so many opportunities out there for me now, I can’t wait to see where they take me!” The winning translation can be read on the Stephen Spender Trust’s website ( First Prize – Open Category (2024) – Stephen Spender Trust ) and will be published in print in Modern Poetry in Translation magazine. * The 37th annual MS Readathon, running from November 1st to December 15th, encourages children and adults to dive into the joy of reading while raising vital funds for MS Ireland. Launched in 1988 by Roald Dahl, the event has grown into a much-loved initiative, supporting more than 10,000 people living with multiple sclerosis in Ireland. This year’s campaign highlights the benefits of reading, with an MS Ireland survey revealing that 75 per cent of parents noticed enhanced creativity and imagination in children who read regularly. Participants are invited to read as many books as possible, with fundraising made easier through personalised QR codes and online platforms. Funds raised help MS Ireland provide crucial services such as physiotherapy, peer support, and respite care. To join, visit msreadathon.ie. According to author Eoin Colfer: “Reading sparks curiosity and imagination, offering worlds that stay with us forever.” * The launch of (S)worn State(s) - a new poetry book by the inaugural winners of the Markievicz Award: Annemarie Ní Churreáin, Kimberly Campanello and Dimitra Xidous, will take place on December 16th at MOLI, Museum of Literature Dublin. Tickets here. This collaborative book is published by world-renowned letterpress The Salvage Press. (S)worn State(s) draws upon social history, myth, and visionary poetics to remember, challenge, and reimagine ‘worn’ narratives of women’s experiences in the context of shifting historical and cultural landscapes in Ireland in the Irish Decade of Centenaries and beyond. * The Limerick Writers’ Centre launches Head First, From a Height, the debut novel by Cork-based author Freyja Hellebust, winner of the 2024 Gerald Griffin Competition for First Original Adult Fiction, on Wednesday, November 27th at 7pm at Prim’s Bookshop in Kinsale, with writer Niamh Prior performing the official launch. “We are thrilled to recognise Freyja Hellebust’s exceptional talent,” says Dominic Taylor of the Limerick Writers’ Centre. “Her novel showcases the vibrant state of original fiction writing in Ireland today.” Hellebust’s literary journey began at age 14 when she won a short story competition at Listowel Writers’ Week. Her talent continued to flourish through her teenage years, garnering multiple accolades including recognition in the Trinity College Book of Kells competition. In 2023, she was awarded the UCC Eoin Murray Memorial Scholarship for creative writing. The Gerald Griffin Competition, named after the renowned Limerick writer (1803-1840), celebrates emerging talent in Irish literature. Griffin’s own masterpiece, The Collegians, achieved international recognition and inspired numerous adaptations across various media. * The Dublin Literary Award will celebrate 30 years in 2025. Dublin City Council this week announced the members of the judging panel, for this, the world’s largest prize for a single novel published in English. The international panel of judges features Gerbrand Bakker, Dutch author and winner of the Dublin Literary Award (formerly IMPAC Prize) in 2010; Martina Devlin, award-winning Irish author and newspaper columnist; Fiona Sze-Lorrain, writer, poet, translator, musician and editor based in Paris; Prof Leonard Cassuto, professor of American literature at Fordham University, freelance literary journalist, columnist, editor and author; and Nidhi Zak/Aria Eipe, poet and editor based in Dublin. The non-voting chairperson is Prof Chris Morash, the Seamus Heaney Professor of Irish Writing at Trinity College Dublin who has led the judging process since 2019. Uniquely, the award receives its nominations from public libraries around the world and recognises both writers and translators. In 2024, there were 70 books on the 2024 longlist nominated from 80 libraries in 35 countries. This judging panel will choose both the shortlist and ultimate winner of the award. The longlist will be announced on January 14th and the 30th winner of this internationally renowned award will be announced next May as part of International Literature Festival Dublin. * The Bridport Prize international writing competition has announced a new £500 Never Too Late Award to unlock the hidden talent of older writers. Writers in later life often struggle to be seen despite a wealth of experience, creativity and stories to tell. This award is for the highest placed writer in the competition aged 60+ across poetry, short story, novel or flash fiction. The deadline is May 31st, 2025. Championed by bestselling author Kit de Waal (64) and London Literary Agent, AM Heath (in business for over a century), this award aims to recognise success over 60 and a ‘never give up’ resilience that is the mainstay of writers. ‘What a privilege to be associated with this award!’ says Kit de Waal. ‘My first novel was published when I was 56, something I never imagined possible. There again, at 56 I was just getting my second wind (or possibly my third …) and even now at 64 I consider myself mid-career with a lot more to do and say. Thanks to The Bridport Prize and the Never Too Late Award, we can recognise the unique voice and hard work of older writers who are just getting started. Hoorah for us!’ Now in her mid 60s, Kit is a highly acclaimed writer of novel, memoir and TV drama. Her bestselling novel, My Name Is Leon is on the English literature GCSE school curriculum while her latest novel The Best Of Everything is published next April. * Rory Brennan, the former director of Poetry Ireland and a lecturer at DCU, died last Sunday in Blackrock Hospice. He is survived by his wife Fionnuala and daughters Orla and Fiona. Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

The huge inflows come after options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF kicked off on November 19, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of the listing of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs last month. Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted the largest inflows of any fund yesterday, drawing in just over $608 million on November 21, according to data from Farside Investors. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), meanwhile, attracted over $301 million of new funds, while Bitwise’s Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) fund attracted $68 million. Though historically extremely high, yesterday's ETF inflows are still quite a way off those recorded on November 8, amid the immediate run-up to the election of Donald Trump and widespread speculation regarding the impact of the pro-crypto U.S. government. Blackrock’s IBIT pulled in a total of $1.12 billion on November 7, beating out its prior October 30 record of $872 million, according to data from SoSoValue. Trump had promised to protect crypto mining interests, fire regulators like the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Gary Gensler (who subsequently announced he was stepping down), and even establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. The news of record inflows comes as Bitcoin ETFs are increasingly becoming one of the dominant ways in which Bitcoin is held. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted how U.S. bitcoin ETFs hit $100 billion in assets on November 22 in a tweet. Speaking of "100" milestones, the US bitcoin ETFs hit $100b in assets (altho more like $104b given the price surge overnight) w/ YTD flows flirting with $30b (double our estimate). They're now 97% of way to passing Satoshi as biggest holder and 82% of way to passing gold ETFs. pic.twitter.com/Y3070yW7Jx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2024 This means that Bitcoin EFTs now account for a larger proportion of the total Bitcoin held than Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, and represent about 82% of the total value of Gold ETFs. However, it seems Bitcoin ETFs’ rosy investor sentiment hasn't carried over to Ethereum ETFs. Per Farside Investors data, Ethereum ETFs have recorded outflows every day consecutively since November 14, hemorrhaging $7 million on November 21.

Title: Goldman Sachs: The Boeing Company (BA) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-boeing-company-ba-110525509.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Growth Investment Ratio: 292% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another mega-American firm that has faced a lot of troubles in 2024. While Intel’s troubles are in the semiconductor industry and have not affected downstream players, the firm’s production woes in the aftermath of safety problems with its aircraft have disrupted the travel industry as well. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has faced off with striking unions and regulators, the cumulative effect of which has led to delayed aircraft deliveries. As a result, the road is long and hard for the firm to regain its lost stature; a fact that’s also evident in its 44.9% year-to-date share price drop. Production efficiencies and safety overhaul coupled with satisfied employees are driving The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s hypothesis and have the potential to affect its share price moving forward. In the meantime, multi-billion dollar orders such as a recent $2.6 billion Air Force contract for prototype aircraft should help the firm. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s management commented on its production during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “The quarter ended with approximately 60 737-8s built prior to 2023, the vast majority for customers in China and India, down 30 from last quarter. Additional progress on shutting down the shadow factory has been impacted by the work stoppage, which will now extend into next year. On the -7 and -10, inventory levels remained stable at approximately 35 airplanes and the certification time lines remain unchanged. On the 787 program, we delivered 14 airplanes in the quarter. And as previously noted, we continue to work through production recovery plans on heat exchangers and delivery delays associated with seat certifications. Overall, BA ranks 3rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Meet Don Jr.’s New Boss

Hours after ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on a Monday last December, Omeed Malik hosted a party at the Core Club in midtown Manhattan. He suggested I come along. “Just look decent,” he texted me, after I asked about a dress code. It was a relatively small gathering. Skyline views. A few New York Post reporters were making the rounds, as were producers for Tucker Carlson, whose post–Fox News career Malik was funding. It was here that the financier wanted to tell me about his idea for a “parallel economy” — a kind of Brexit for conservatives from corporate America, which he saw tilting inexorably into wokeness. Malik’s answer to DEI, he told me, was his own acronym: EIG, or companies that prioritize entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth. “73 million people voted for Donald Trump, and the Brookings Institute quantifies that as 30 percent of American GDP,” he said — totaling roughly $7 trillion. “That’s the third-largest economy in the world. I’m happy to be the financier of the third-largest economy. I don’t need to go to Vietnam or India. I’m here.” As we were talking, though, I couldn’t stop looking at the orange horse-patterned scarf he wore around his dark suit. “Hermès,” he said. “And so is the tie. I guess that’s not necessarily a man-of-the-people look, but it looks good nonetheless.” (As for me, well, I tried.) Nearly a year has passed, and it looks like Malik’s pitch is meeting its moment. Donald Trump’s second election win comes amid a massive corporate retrenchment: the scaling back of DEI, the lionization of anti-woke crusaders like Vivek Ramaswamy and Robbie Starbuck, and the end of the CEO as culture warrior. Malik was already one of the most quietly influential forces dismantling so-called woke capitalism. And now he’s Donald Trump Jr.’s new boss, after the president-elect’s oldest son — a close friend — joined his venture-capital firm, 1789 Capital, as a partner. Woke capitalism is a messy term, but there’s no doubt that the last few years have been a strange time in corporate America. After the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Wall Street banks stepped into the void left by lawmakers and limited business for gun sellers and manufacturers. Larry Fink, the CEO of private-equity giant BlackRock, wrote a letter that same year saying that corporations should not just look out for their shareholders, but make “a positive contribution to society,” and has sold financial products geared toward lofty environmental, sustainability, and governance (or ESG) goals. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which challenged businesses to hire and promote women and minorities, proliferated. The marriage between capital and social justice was sometimes comically awkward. (See: the same jokes every June about weapons manufacturers rolling out their Pride logos on social media.) But to the conservative side of Wall Street, this wasn’t just harmless posturing; it was a means of cutting off financing from businesses. “We looked at a deal with an apparel company — a big portion of this company’s customers are hunters,” Christopher Buskirk, a 1789 co-founder and chief investment officer, told me. “A fund had a deal to buy this company, but broke the deal because, they said, the fact that some of their customers wore the apparel while hunting violated their ESG agreement.” Malik is quite possibly the poster boy for the post-cancellation conservative glow-up. Born in New Jersey to Iranian and Pakistani immigrants, he was, in his own telling, a “run-of-the-mill” Democrat until a few years ago. He wrote speeches for a Democratic congressman, Donald Payne Jr.; after law school, he went to work for Jon Corzine, the onetime Goldman Sachs partner and New Jersey governor, at commodities trading firm MF Global. (Soon after Malik joined, the company collapsed into bankruptcy.) Within a few years, Malik was running one of Bank of America’s most important businesses, its prime-services desk, a special brokerage service that caters to hedge funds. “He was the hotshot young Wall Street guy, and it was a business that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had had a lock on for 20 or 30 years,” one former client said. “He really put them on the map.” On Wall Street, his vibe was decidedly pre–Great Financial Crisis. “With Omeed, it was back to the future,” said Scott Bessent, founder of the hedge fund Key Group, who is currently in the running to be the next Treasury secretary. “His companies are a modern model, but with an old-fashioned ethos.” He wore mirrored aviators, flaunted nice clothes, partied with beautiful women. He would eventually land a walk-on role on the Showtime series Billions. If you’d come across him at, say, Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT conference for hedge-fund managers, you’d find a man who had no second thoughts about enjoying his success. Then, in 2018, he was fired. Allegations of “unwanted advances” toward a female banker were leaked to business reporters. Malik filed a defamation suit against Bank of America, denying that he had done anything wrong. He also filed a claim against the bank alleging that he was fired in retaliation after complaining that one of his bosses didn’t have the required securities licenses. (A markets watchdog later fined the bank over the issue.) Bank of America soon reportedly settled with him for eight figures, and he used some of that money to start his own investment bank, called Farvahar Partners. (He declined to comment on the settlement.) Other companies would follow: 1789 Capital, a venture-capital firm, would invest directly in companies. Colombier, a blank-check acquisition firm, would take them public through SPAC mergers. Soon he was again connecting companies with money from investors, this time in private, as well as public, markets — a sign that his reputation wasn’t really affected by the news. “He does his work, and he understands the role that he’s meant to play. And if he presents that he can do something, he does it. I haven’t seen him fail when he says he’s going to do something,” one person familiar with his business around this time told me. That night at the Core Club, Malik described to me how the pandemic had become a political breaking point for him. At the time, he was newly married and his wife was pregnant. Even though pregnant women were excluded from clinical COVID-vaccine trials, health officials still recommended they take the shots. He was against the prolonged lockdowns and vaccine mandates to re-enter public life. “That was when I said I’ve had it, and we moved to Florida,” he said. Political-donation records show his break from Democrats started earlier, though. During the first half of 2019, almost all of Malik’s donations went to Democrats, including $2,800 each to Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. By July, he had switched almost entirely to Republicans, including Donald Trump. By April 2020, he was contributing to Carlson’s conservative outlet the Daily Caller, and by August, he had invested in the site. It was around this time that Malik and Don Jr. first co-bylined an op-ed that was critical of China. Malik and Don Jr. have been described as very close by three people familiar with their friendship — often traveling and hanging out together. But Malik, a Mar-a-Lago member, has also been quietly making inroads with some of MAGA world’s most important figures not named Trump. He has backing from Rebekah Mercer, the Republican mega-donor, while Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel protégé who has lost two bids for Congress in Arizona, sits on the board of 1789. He has donated to, and frequently interviewed, Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democrat. Malik was also described by one Trump adviser as part of J.D. Vance’s inner circle. Malik was one of the biggest backers of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raising millions of dollars for his third-party election campaign. But he remained close to the Trump family, according to two people directly familiar with his relationships. “He was day one,” one said. “There’s a group who just kept going after January 6, and he was part of that.” (Malik’s Instagram account on that day shows a video from the Capitol riots with the caption”I don’t care what side someone is on — violence is unacceptable in every situation,” but doesn’t mention Trump.) Two people told me he was involved in getting Kennedy and Gabbard to endorse Trump, and helped them get administration appointments: Gabbard as the director of national intelligence, and Kennedy to lead Health and Human Services. But what good is a parallel economy when you’ve already won? 1789 has invested in companies like Substack, which has been a favorite of the conservative, non-elite media, as well as a pharmaceutical-delivery service that doesn’t seem obviously involved in any culture wars. Malik took the retail company Public Square, a kind of Amazon for conservatives, public last year through a SPAC, and he now sits on the board. Since its debut, however, the stock is down about 90 percent from its peak, and its last quarterly report showed it made $6.5 million in revenue — about what Amazon makes every ten minutes. (Malik holds a roughly 10 percent stake in the company and hasn’t sold any shares. He has been collecting a $60,000-a-month consulting fee from the company, two people familiar with the arrangement told me. One of them said that arrangement ended in November.) Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos has been trying to get in Trump’s good graces, and Amazon’s stock — the real thing, not the anti-woke version — is near all-time highs. With wokeness on the retreat, it’s not clear whether Malik’s old playbook will be as relevant as it once was. But with his fortune and his deep connections to the incoming presidential administration, he probably isn’t too bothered by that. “When you’re the loyal opposition, maybe it’s okay to have ‘anti-’ in front of your name,” Malik said during a November 17 CNBC interview. “But I think we were validated in our thesis a couple of weeks ago.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: The 'Roaring 20s' rally will continue in 2025. UBS shares 8 ways to maximize gains.

Full Content:
If the future is anything like the last five years, not even a crystal ball could prepare investors for what's ahead. Anyone who had known heading into 2020 that a once-a-century pandemic was imminent likely would have unloaded all of their risk assets and braced for a years-long economic contraction. But that would have been a massive mistake, as a brief global downturn during the health crisis soon yielded to a booming economic recovery. Global markets are up around 50% in the last half decade while GDP growth has surged and US corporate earnings have risen roughly 70%. "Markets have had a 'roaring 20s' — with five years of strong performance for global equity market indices, technological breakthroughs, and stronger-than-expected US economic growth," strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management (GWM) recently wrote. Although it's impossible to predict what's next and how markets will respond, the team at UBS GWM gave it a shot in their 2025 outlook report, which was released on November 21. A key focus of the report is how the global economy may be at a pivot point, following a surge in populist sentiment that culminated in the election of Donald Trump earlier this month. While Wall Street is confident that there will be a continued boom under Trump, UBS GWM is less sure. This new political regime "might extend or end the Roaring 20s," strategists remarked. What happens may depend in large part on what happens with Trump's tariff policy. "A tariff shock could trigger a stagflationary downside scenario," UBS GWM strategists said. "At the same time, negotiations with trading partners or domestic legal challenges might mitigate their scope and impact, and tax cuts and deregulation could support a more positive market narrative." With that in mind, UBS GWM is preaching humility and portfolio diversification to its clients. After all, investors have seen how troubling global events can coincide with rallies, and vice versa. "We have to be prepared for a wide range of outcomes in the year ahead," Mark Haefele, UBS GWM's chief investment officer, said in a statement. There are four potential templates that markets could follow in 2025, in UBS GWM's view. UBS GWM thinks the most likely outcome is that the US economy will continue to grow, even as tariffs are implemented, due to deregulation and bright sentiment from business leaders. In this backdrop, the S&P 500 could rise to 6,600, provided that inflation and interest rates also fall. "The prospect of lower taxes and deregulation adding to a positive 'Roaring 20s' market narrative built on solid growth, and continued investment in AI" has led to optimism in markets, Haefele noted. An even more upbeat view is that the S&P 500 will soar to 7,000 thanks to exceptionally strong economic growth and continued excitement about artificial intelligence, all with minimal inflation. Stocks would also benefit from lower taxes, fewer regulations, and trade deals that minimize the pain that tariffs could bring. Interest rate cuts would be the icing on the cake. Investors will most likely be satisfied at the end of next year, UBS GWM believes, as the firm assigned a 50% likelihood to its base case and a 25% chance to the bull scenario. However, there's about a one in four chance that next year is marked by major market losses. A so-called "tariff shock" scenario has about a 15% chance of happening, and it could send the S&P 500 tumbling to 5,100 as a burgeoning trade war sends inflation higher while crushing global growth. In this backdrop, it's hard to see how US stocks could dodge heavy losses. "The risk scenario is that trade tariffs, excessive fiscal deficits, and geopolitical strife will contribute to higher inflation, weaker growth, and market volatility," UBS GWN strategists said. Tariffs are far from the only risk to markets. An old-fashioned recession featuring a weaker jobs market and softer consumer spending could send the S&P 500 all the way back to 4,500. Although there's no way to know which of those four outcomes will occur, UBS GWM spotlighted eight investments that are likely to appreciate. Technology stocks are among the firm's top ideas, including semiconductor firms and companies tied to artificial intelligence. Tariffs could weigh on growth, but the sector's long-term growth story is likely intact regardless of what happens on the political policy front. "AI infrastructure spending remains robust, and we expect key semiconductor components needed for AI to remain supply constrained in 2025, supporting pricing," UBS GWM strategists wrote. Utilities are also a less heralded way to ride AI momentum, UBS GWM noted, plus the group is defensive and could hold up better in a bearish scenario. "Although utilities companies with high renewables exposure could face near-term pressures, we also expect significant growth in AI data centers to fuel power demand, leading to higher power prices," UBS GWM strategists wrote. The other sector that UBS GWM highlighted is financials, which has handily outperformed the market in the last month. Strategists are confident that the group has more room to run. "We expect Fed rate cuts to lead to lower funding costs, higher loan growth, and more capital market activity," UBS GWM strategists wrote. "Following the US election, we also expect the financial sector to benefit from deregulation." In international markets, the firm is bullish on Asian stocks outside of Japan as interest rates fall in the region. Additionally, small- and mid-sized European stocks — which are relatively cheap — should benefit from solid economic growth and lower rates, though tariffs are a risk. Outside of equities, UBS GWM recommends high-quality bonds while interest rates fall. Bond yields have risen lately on the back of Trump's win, since investors now expect higher growth, inflation, and budget deficits. This may be a good time to lock in higher rates, UBS GWM said. "We believe investment-grade bonds offer attractive yields and expect mid-single-digit returns in US dollar terms," UBS GWM strategists wrote. Precious metals are also worth owning, UBS GWM said. Gold can continue to rise to $2,900 next year, in the firm's view — and copper, lithium, and nickel also appear to have upside. "In 2025, we believe gold will remain an effective hedge against key political concerns, including government debt levels, inflation, or geopolitical tensions," UBS GWM strategists wrote. Lastly, investors should have exposure to real estate, in light of lower interest rates, limited supply, and healthy demand. Residential and commercial properties both make sense, though UBS GWM specifically cited property types like logistics, data centers, and multifamily housing. Jump to

Oura smart rings will soon be able to help users track their blood sugar levels through a new partnership with Dexcom (DXCM), the maker of the U.S.’s first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) head of vaccine safety said on Thursday that President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of vaccine skeptics like Robert. F. Kennedy Jr. could be an opportunity for the science community to make a case for vaccines to the public. Novo Nordisk (NVO) — the company credited with ushering in the current weight-loss drug revolution when it launched its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic in 2017 — is working on its next act, a stronger weight-loss drug called CagriSema.

Title: Katriona O'Sullivan: So many children in poverty and Fine Gael's answer is a savings account?

If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 22 Nov WHEN POLITICAL PARTIES release their election manifestos, there’s bound to be one or two elements that cause us to roll our eyes. But this week, there was one offering in particular that just stuck in my craw. At a time of increasing deprivation and child poverty, I found myself seriously questioning who is advising Simon Harris, and Fine Gael, in terms of their policy decisions. In their manifesto, admittedly amid some fine ideas, we also had the unveiling of the ‘Acorn’ project, which stopped me in my tracks. The Acorn project promises to deposit €1,000 into a bank account set up for every child born in the state. The account will be in the child’s name, and as a mark of their consideration for the poor unfortunate children from disadvantaged backgrounds, they will allocate an extra €500 to these children. So every child born in Ireland will get a bank account created for them and Fine Gael will deposit €1,000 to most kids, and €1,500 to the poor kids. According to Harris, the aim of this hair-brained scheme is to encourage parents to save for their children’s future. The Fine Gael Manifesto highlights that if a family were to deposit €2,000 annually into the account, the child would potentially have almost €53,000 by the time they turn 18. Harris himself said that Acorn “fosters a culture of saving and financial literacy, and it will help get every child off to the best start in life.” Let’s start with what is good about Acorn — the idea itself isn’t a bad one, wouldn’t we all like to be a bit better at saving, and teach our children the value of saving for the future? However, the idea that we need to be told, or taught, how to save for our children is slightly patronising. What underpins Acorn is the idea that Fine Gael needs to teach us how to be better parents, and how to be financially literate. Advertisement Firstly, this is totally unnecessary when it comes to the middle-income bracket. Most people I know in this position are already financially literate, they are already putting away money for their children’s future — even if it is only the child benefit — many are preparing themselves for college fees or the like. The manifesto comes from a party that prides itself on its financial prudence and on how it pulled us out of austerity, so shouldn’t it be the one to teach us about money? The Acorn promise is especially annoying for me because we are being taught financial literacy by a political party that some may argue isn’t as financially literate as it claims. For one, Fine Gael has overseen years of growing inequality, and hasn’t it been in charge of the biggest overspend on a national hospital in the history of the world? Are we to take financial guidance from a party that has, with its coalition partners, presided over an economy so heavily reliant on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) that it’s now exceptionally vulnerable to global shocks? One of the parties to oversee the most painful and pervasive housing crises in the history of modern Ireland? We have the lowest investment in education per person across the OECD — oh, and we spend 100s of thousands of euros on bike sheds when we have thousands of children on waiting lists for psychological assessments. It perturbs me a little to have this government saying they are going to teach me how to manage my money better, when they clearly have not been able to manage MY money better themselves. Imagine the scenario where a newborn child is born into homeless services or housing insecurity (which is happening right now), and his or her parents have no money to spare — no home, and no capacity to support their child. They may be living in a hotel room — probably buying takeaway food most nights because they have no cooking facilities. But Fine Gael will pop €1,500 into the child’s bank account to encourage the parents to think about the child’s future. A carrot to dangle in front of them, the promise of a bright future they can’t yet see. It is estimated that Acorn will cost the state about €78 million a year; would we not be better off spending that money on housing, health or helping children get the security they need to live a full and free life? I was homeless, I lived in the insecurity of homeless services when I was 16 — me and my child — and I still carry the indelible mark of homelessness with me. I never feel fully safe in my home. I always have a low-level worry that I may lose where I live. The 4,561 children currently living in homeless services in Ireland deserve better than token gestures. The 378 families living in hotels and hostels in Dublin for over two years deserve more. They need support now. Not in 18 years. My final problem with the Acorn project is that potentially it will increase inequality — rather than reduce it. An issue which was also flagged by the Labour leader Ivana Bacik this week. Let’s imagine that Acorn is set up for each child, and the families who can save in it do, and the families who can’t save in it don’t — what do you think is going to happen? We are going to see a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.

While the poor kid growing up in homeless services, whose mam and dad are barely making ends meet, will be left further behind. He won’t be getting a new car at age 18, or a trip inter-railing with his pals. If I were advising Simon Harris, I would tell him that we don’t need shiny new things to impress us, we don’t need one-off payments or Acorn savings schemes. What we need is for your party and your political colleagues to press STOP on political gimmicks and revisit the genuine, heartfelt reasons you went into politics. We need you to admit the failings of the last few years, we need you to be honest and earnest in your recognition that things have gone wrong, and most importantly we need a commitment to the children of Ireland that you will do more to reduce inequality and ensure that everyone gets the opportunity to shine — and to feel safe.

Title: Farmers have hoarded land for too long. Inheritance tax will bring new life to rural Britain

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/21/2024 9:53:46 PM PST by Jonty30 One of the baleful dimensions of our times is the way that the conversation about what constitutes the good society is framed by the rich and their interests. A conception of the common good withers; instead it is replaced by the existential importance of private wealth, private interests and private ownership to societal health. Nowhere is this more exposed than in the debate over taxation, and in particular the taxation of inherited wealth – as the debate over the past fortnight has dramatised. Half a million people die every year. Under the reforms to inheritance tax relief on agricultural land proposed in the budget, about 500 individuals who inherit land worth more than £2m (£3m if they were married to the deceased) will join the rest of society and have inheritance tax levied on their bequest – albeit at half the rate, with an enlarged exemption and 10 years to pay it, concessions not made to the rest of us.

According to SoSoValue data, this achievement represents 5.4% of Bitcoin’s total market value. The 12 Bitcoin ETFs, launched by prominent issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity, have reached this milestone in just 10 months since their debut in January. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which manages $45.4 billion in assets. Grayscale’s GBTC takes the second spot with $20.6 billion, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) follows in third with $18.4 billion. Other notable contributors include the Ark 21 Shares BTC ETF (ARKB) at $4.6 billion and Bitwise BITB at $4 billion. The rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs makes them one of the most successful fund categories to date.

Title: Russia creates plan for division of Ukraine and may offer it to USA - Media

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/21/2024 6:00:12 PM PST by hardspunned The Russian Ministry of Defense has developed a forecast for the evolution of the global military-political situation until 2045, which includes the elimination of Ukraine and its division into parts. Moscow may transmit this plan to the United States through diplomatic channels, according to the Interfax-Ukraine agency. How Russia’s plan looks The first part, according to the Russian plan, involves the so-called new regions of Russia. This refers to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions, and Crimea with Sevastopol, which are to officially become part of the Russian Federation. This is the focus of Moscow today. The second part, according to agency sources, is the pro-Russian state formation. This concerns the creation of a "state" with pro-Russian authorities in the territories of the city of Kyiv, the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, and Zhytomyr regions. This "state formation" will reject European and Euro-Atlantic integration and will agree to a Russian military presence, following the example of Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The third part involves the disputed territories in western Ukraine. These are the Volhynia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Chernivtsi, and Zakarpattia regions, which the Kremlin plans to divide with neighboring Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

Putin will stop today with what he has and a neutral Ukraine. Nope, DC doubles down again and by doing so doubles down on Uke territorial losses. That third part is going to get messy.

Putin has tried relentlessly to NOT take Ukrainian territory. All the Ukes had to do was quit killing ethnic Russians and play by Minsk rules. Where are you getting these Russian propaganda talking points? Putin has been trying his best to take Ukrainian territory. The story of Ukraine killing ethnic Russians is pure myth. Ukraine passed the law required by Minsk that would have given autonomy to Donbas and was in the process of conducting the required referendum. It was Russia who violated Minsk by not withdrawing its forces, by not handing over the border to Ukraine, and by blocking Ukraine's referendum, all required by Minsk.All the Ukes had to do was to abide by the negotiated Istanbul peace accords and Ukraine would have gotten everything but Crimea back. There was no negotiated agreement at Istanbul, Russia's demands were too high. Nor had Russia agreed to withdraw from the territory that it occupied.Putin will stop today with what he has and a neutral Ukraine. Putin rejected this proposal by Turkey. Putin has publicly declared that he will start negotiations only after Ukraine withdraws from the rest of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzia. 11 posted on 11/21/2024 6:15:11 PM PST by Petrosius [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep Good news finally.

Russia’s largest refineries are having to shut down, as Russian oil industry revenues have continued dropping significantly five months in a row. Putin has scuttled Russia beyond repair. They need a bailout, and China is not going to do it, while they have problems of their own.

This refers to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions, and Crimea with Sevastopol, which are to officially become part of the Russian Federation. This is the focus of Moscow today. The second part, according to agency sources, is the pro-Russian state formation. This concerns the creation of a "state" with pro-Russian authorities in the territories of the city of Kyiv, the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, and Zhytomyr regions. This "state formation" will reject European and Euro-Atlantic integration and will agree to a Russian military presence, following the example of Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The third part involves the disputed territories in western Ukraine. These are the Volhynia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Chernivtsi, and Zakarpattia regions, which the Kremlin plans to divide with neighboring Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

Title: Gene Munster Is Bullish, Talks About Pressure Points on Nvidia’s (NVDA) Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster shared his views about NVIDIA (NVDA)'s earnings call yesterday. Here is a summary of his thoughts: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company’s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don’t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much. The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company’s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia’s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs. The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia’s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia’s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small. This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier—from “into 2025” to “mid-2025.” Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn’t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum. Driving Nvidia’s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, likened this to Moore’s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry’s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia’s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook. Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia’s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate. Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ezmsg-blackrock added to PyPI

Time Published: 2024-11-22T00:22:35Z

pip install ezmsg-blackrock Copy PIP instructions Released: Nov 22, 2024 Blackrock Cerebus ecosystem interface for ezmsg Interface for Blackrock Cerebus ecosystem (incl. Neuroport) using pycbsdk pip install git+https://github.com/CerebusOSS/ezmsg-blackrock IMPORTANT NOTE: pycbsdk is only compatible with Central Neuroport/Cerebus Suite/NSP Firmware 7.0.5+, built using cbhwlib/hardware library/network protocol 3.11+. Anything older is not supported by pycbsdk. Check this requirement in Central by navigating to Help > About Central Blackrock Neuroport/Cerebus uses UDP multicast traffic to deliver upwards of 30000 packets/sec of data with low latency. There are better ways to do this now, but back when this hardware was made, the engineers were dealing with the limitations of the hardware they had. UDP comes with no packet delivery guarantee, but dropped packets can be catastrophic when interfacing with the Blackrock hardware. As such, do your best to locate the highest quality networking equipment you can find, and have a high tolerance for blaming ethernet adapters and/or your router/switch for errors during troubleshooting. The NSP startup procedure involves blasting several thousand UDP packets from the NSP to the interfacing computer in a few milliseconds. Many low-quality adapters and network switches will simply drop some of these UDP packets, but this will result in errors during startup. This setup describes a setup with a Legacy NSP, a Windows PC (called "Central PC") running Central Suite that can configure the NSP, and a third machine (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) that will be running ezmsg-blackrock, henceforth forward referred to as the "Client PC". The documentation highlights the differences when using Blockrock's newer ("Gemini") NSP and Hubs. Central cannot run on the same PC simultaneously as ezmsg-blackrock because pycbsdk exclusively binds the port that central would use to communicate with the NSP. The NSP has too many settings to implement in ezmsg-blackrock, so in practice, we use Central to configure the NSP then acquire live data thereafter. If you want to, you can use ezmsg-blackrock on the Central PC once you've configured the NSP and closed Central. When you do this, the Central PC and the Client PC are the same PC/IP address. Its assumed that this PC is running windows because Central Suite is only available on Windows. Find the highest quality ethernet (yes, wired) network switch or router that you can. Look for 1+ Gigabit speed ratings (2.5 Gigabit better, 10 Gigabit is best), and features like QoS (Quality of Service) that can guarantee packet delivery. Ensure both the Central PC and the Client PC have high quality ethernet network adapters. Not every ethernet adapter will work, due to packet buffering requirements. High quality ethernet cables are also important; aim for Cat6E or better. It is possible to emulate Blackrock hardware while playing back previously recorded data using a software tool called "nPlayServer". The publicly-available and supported nPlayServer is only available on Windows but unsupported Mac and Linux binaries (x86 or ARM) are available. Open an issue to ask. If your intention is to only test on 'localhost' (i.e., ezmsg-blackrock and nPlayServer on the same machine), then there is nothing more to be done. However, if your intention is for the emulation PC to be a different machine than the client PC, nPlayServer must be configured to work over the network. 0.2.2 Nov 22, 2024 0.2.1 Nov 22, 2024 0.2.0 Nov 22, 2024 0.1.0 Nov 22, 2024 Download the file for your platform.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Nov 21, 2024 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, War | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. “This is a war that should never have happened,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the beginning of the year. “It’s a war the Russians tried repeatedly to settle on terms that were very very beneficial to Ukraine.” “The big military contractors want to add new countries to NATO all the time,” he said. Why? “Because then that country has to conform its military purchases to NATO weapon specifications which means certain companies … get a trapped market,” he explained. Who Really Profits from the Ukraine War? By Wisdom Land, 2 September 2024 Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business – namely, opportunity. It’s not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine’s vast agricultural lands- among the most fertile in the world – are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (“RFK Jr.”) deftly and clearly explains. [You can find a copy of the video above published by RFK Jr. on YouTube HERE and a write-up published by Indian news outlet Times Now World HERE.] JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country’s reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a “blended finance” approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate, and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock, and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The “fund of reconstruction” proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country’s future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company’s presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey’s lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process.

(NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other trending AI stocks that are making waves today. Is artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn’t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn’t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House.

As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country’s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader. News like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many. According to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren’t trained enough (or at all), there’s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools. This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way.

(NASDAQ:PANW) offers AI-driven cybersecurity solutions for all apps, users, and devices. On November 21, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a “Buy” rating on Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and raised the price target to $420.00. Several factors, such as the company’s impressive financial performance, and strategic growth initiatives, have led to the rating. The company’s next-generation security ARR has surged 40% year-over-year, reaching $4.5 billion. Meanwhile, its RPO has grown 20% to $12.6 billion. These metrics demonstrate the high demand for Palo Alto’s products. Moreover, the company’s focus on platformization on a unified AI-driven platform and product innovations, including Cortex and SASE, is driving substantial growth and paving the way for further opportunities. Overall PANW ranks 7th on our list of the trending AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Do Redditors Think That Altimmune Inc. (ALT) Has a Big Upside Potential?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Reddit Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) stands against the other Redditor-approved stocks. Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, together with Dana D'Auria, Envestnet co-chief Investment Officer, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell: Overtime' on November 12 to discuss the market's reaction to the election results and earnings. Paul Hickey believes that the AI bull market is likely to continue now. This recent conversation centered around the key forces to watch in the current political and economic landscape, particularly in light of potential energy impacts from Ukraine, shifts in Middle Eastern policies, and possible market effects from trade policies with China. Hickey thinks that as President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet begins to take shape, it will provide clearer insights into future expectations. He emphasized that while election results can lower barriers to the market and reduce speed bumps, their impact is often overstated. He notes that over the past 16 years, the market has shown strong performance under different administrations, with annualized returns of 16.3% during both Barack Obama’s and Donald Trump’s first terms, and 14% under Joe Biden. This consistency, according to Hickey, suggests that market returns have remained relatively stable despite varying political landscapes. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing AI bull market, which has been broadening since the summer and is expected to continue. The S&P 500 recently closed above 6,000, reflecting positive momentum in the markets, including gains in the NASDAQ. There was a discussion about how a sweeping victory for one party could have been perceived as detrimental to equities; however, Republicans achieved this outcome and equities responded positively. To maintain this momentum, D'Auria suggested that Republicans might need to exercise more fiscal responsibility. The implication is that a single party cannot implement all its plans without consideration of fiscal implications. D'Auria thinks that as tax cuts from 2017 are likely to be extended under Republican leadership, inflation concerns may arise due to higher tariffs and increased government spending. The Republican stance thus far has been viewed as pro-business, which is reflected in current market performance. However, a potential challenge lies ahead; she is of the idea that stocks are now being priced with expectations of a low regulatory environment. This regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining market growth moving forward. As the market continues to react positively to political developments and the ongoing AI bull market, investors should consider focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Methodology We sifted through threads to compile a list of 30 trending stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 11 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A researcher in a lab coat examining a petri dish of a biopharmaceutical drug. Average Upside Potential as of November 11: 167.76% Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops peptide-based therapeutics for obesity and liver diseases. Its lead drug, Pemvidutide, targets obesity and liver inflammation. They are also developing HepTcell, an immunotherapy for chronic hepatitis B. The company reported positive developments for its drug candidate Pemvidutide, a novel GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist in its obesity program, designed to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It finished enrolling patients in its Phase 2b IMPACT trial (~190 people). This trial assesses Pemvidutide's effectiveness and safety in treating MASH. Top-line data on the drug's success is expected in the second quarter of 2025. If successful, Pemvidutide could become the first MASH treatment to achieve both reduced liver fat and significant weight loss within 24 weeks. Overall, it has finalized the design of four pivotal Phase 3 trials with the FDA to assess the impact on obesity-related comorbidities. Additionally, data from a Phase 2 study highlighted its ability to reduce body fat by 21.9% while preserving lean muscle mass, especially in older adults. To expand Pemvidutide's potential, the company plans to submit IND applications for up to three additional indications by the end of 2024, with the first trial anticipated to start in H1 2025. Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is confident that 2025 will be a significant year for Pemvidutide and the company based on the progress made and upcoming milestones. Overall ALT ranks 2nd on our list of the Redditor-approved stocks with biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ALT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ALT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (This Nov. 21 story has been corrected to fix the Nov. 12, 2024 entry to remove reference to cryptocurrency market value hitting $3 trillion 'for the first time') Bitcoin neared $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president fuelled expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled from this year's low of $38,505 and is up about 45 per cent in the two weeks since Trump's sweeping election win. Here are key events in bitcoin's journey towards $100,000: 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the cryptocurrency's presumed developer, introduces the concept of bitcoin 2010: The first retail transaction takes place when a user pays 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's pizzas 2013: As bitcoin's popularity grows, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, file their first application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments launches the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended private bitcoin trust. 2016: The Winklevoss brothers adjust their application numerous times, such as the exchange on which the product would be traded. They also file amendments naming State Street as administrator. Grayscale files with the SEC to convert its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2017: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss application on the grounds bitcoin markets were not mature enough. Grayscale withdraws its first attempt to convert its trust into an ETF, saying the regulatory environment was not developed enough. 2018: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss twins' second application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, saying cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the necessary controls to prevent manipulation. 2020: Grayscale transforms its trust into an SEC-reporting entity, and its shares begin trading on the pink sheets, for stocks that trade over the counter. Although not an ETF, it is the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S. 2021: The first spot bitcoin ETF launches in Canada. Gary Gensler replaces Jay Clayton as SEC chair in April. In October, the SEC approves the ProShares Bitcoin Trust listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting the CME has a satisfactory mechanism for surveilling abuse in the futures market. It is the first U.S.-listed futures-based bitcoin ETF, accumulating $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading - faster than any other ETF. Also in October, Grayscale again submits an application to the SEC to convert its trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC rejects several applications from would-be spot bitcoin ETF issuers, including SkyBridge, Fidelity and Bitwise. The SEC also rejects Grayscale's application, prompting the company to sue the agency. Amid crashing crypto prices, multiple crypto companies file for bankruptcy, including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is also charged with fraud. 2023: May: Cathie Woods' ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets file for a spot bitcoin ETF, giving the SEC a maximum of 240 days to approve or reject the application. June: BlackRock files a spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, raising industry hopes the agency may approve the product and sending the price of bitcoin to a one-year high. A flurry of other issuers and exchanges, including Fidelity and Invesco, file bitcoin ETF applications in the subsequent weeks and months. August: A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. rules in favor of Grayscale, saying the SEC did not justify why it had rejected its proposal. Europe's first spot bitcoin ETF begins trading on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. October: The SEC opts not to appeal the court's ruling in the Grayscale case and is required to reexamine the application. 2024: Jan. 10: The SEC approves 11 proposals from issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, among others, to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. February: Net inflows into the 10 largest ETFs hit $4 billion in the first month, according to LSEG data. March: Bitcoin tops $70,000 for the first time to hit a record high, having doubled in value in the five months. June: Trump pitches himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser. July: Trump tells a bitcoin conference that, if elected, he will create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and will ensure the United States is the "crypto capital of the planet." October: The SEC grants "accelerated approval" to U.S. exchanges to list and trade options tied to 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Nov 6: Trump is declared winner of the presidential election, sparking a huge rally in a range of assets, with bitcoin being the standout gainer. Nov 12: Total crypto market cap tops $3 trillion. Year-to-date ETF net inflows hit $25.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Nov 21: Bitcoin nears $100,000 for the first time in history, driven by a swell of buying from investors in anticipation of Trump dismantling a lot of the regulation around crypto investment. The price has risen by around 40 per cent since the election.

Title: Warner Music Tumbles After Results Show Streaming Slows

(Bloomberg) -- Warner Music Group Corp. stock dropped the most in 18 months after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and said streaming growth stalled. The record label reported net income of $48 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, down 69% from a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.8% to $1.63 billion, beating the $1.59 billion expected by analysts. Recorded music streaming revenue increased 2.1% in the quarter, a significant slowdown from the 9.6% growth in the same period a year earlier and softer than some analysts expected. The shares fell as much as 11% to $29.96 in New York after the results were released but recovered much of those losses later in the day. They were down 5.9% at 2:53 p.m. Warner Music and its larger rival Universal Music Group NV have both been grappling with investors concerns over a slowdown in streaming growth. UMG stock got walloped in July after second-quarter results showed a deceleration in subscription revenue, which it attributed to a slowdown in subscriber growth at some platforms and as Meta Platforms Inc. stopped licensing premium music videos for Facebook. Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. also aren’t signing up a lot of new customers. Investors have known the streaming boom has been over for a while, but seeing the effects in the numbers has spooked Wall Street. Warner Music also said the end of its music distribution deal with BMG would weigh on financial results next year. In September, BMG, a unit of Germany’s Bertelsmann, said it would handle its digital distribution in-house, ending its nearly 8-year deal with WMG. In the first quarter, “streaming growth will be impacted by the BMG digital distribution roll-off, the digital license renewal in the prior year, and the lapping of Spotify price increases,” Bryan Castellani, chief financial officer of Warner Music Group, said on a call with analysts to discuss results. “Our digital distribution relationship with BMG that was planned to roll off by the end of fiscal ‘24 will now continue into fiscal ‘25.” That will affect revenue in the first quarter by about $16 million, he said. Recorded Music revenue was up 3.6% to $1.34 billion, in the fourth quarter, however the end of the distribution agreement with BMG resulted in $25 million less revenue compared with a year earlier, the company said. A renewal with one of the company’s digital partners also resulted in a $4 million “unfavorable impact” on recorded music streaming revenue. Music publishing revenue fell 1% to $295 million, missing analysts expectations of $313 million. (Updates with streaming revenue in third paragraph.)

Indexes ended higher on Thursday as traders digested another solid earnings beat from Nvidia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by almost 500 points, and the S&P 500, while the Nasdaq traded nearly flat as several mega-cap tech names struggled throughout the day. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: Nvidia stock whipsawed throughout the day, flipping between losses and gains before ending the day slightly higher, up 0.5% to $146.67 per share. The company reported another solid earnings beat, with revenue exceeding expectations and guidance coming largely in line with estimates. Over 20 firms boosted their Nvidia price targets afterward. JPMorgan upped its price target from $155 to $170, pointing to its strong competitive edge, while Goldman Sachs lifted its target from $150 to $165 on the expectation the company can deliver over $200 billion in revenue next year. "The team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms," JPMorgan analysts wrote Thursday, adding, "The team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time." Meanwhile, tech stocks largely sold off. Google parent Alphabet ended over 4.5% lower as the US Department of Justice called for the company to divest its Chrome business in an anti-trust push. Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft also closed lower. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims dropped again last week, falling to 213,000, a 6,000 decline from the week before, according to data released Thursday. That number remains near the lowest since April. Continuing claims, or the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, remain high, though. Those claims rose to their highest in three years at 1.91 million last week, a 36,000 increase from the week before.

VOTERS IN DUBLIN Mid-West might think they’re seeing double when they open their ballot paper on 29 November. Two candidates with the same name – and similar taste in snazzy spectacles – are standing in the five-seat constituency. There’s Sinn Féin’s high profile housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin – and there’s Independent-turned-Social Democrats councillor for Clondalkin Eoin Ó Broin. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin, on his second canvas of the day at teatime on Tuesday in freezing conditions, is taking no chances: every prospective Sinn Féin voter is warned about the Other Eoin. “Don’t forget, there will be a second Eoin Ó Broin on the ballot,” he explains to one older voter in an estate on the outskirts of Clondalkin village. “Is he with…?” the woman trails off, seemingly confused. “He’s with the Social Democrats. The way it will be on the ballot, my name will be first with my face and the logo. Just follow the face and the logo.” The Eoin Ó Broins of Dublin Mid-West, of Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats respectively. Alamy / TheJournal Alamy / TheJournal / TheJournal The two men know each other. They both live in this area – they’ve even received each other’s post. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin first became aware of his fellow Eoin 20 years ago when, at a conference in Canada, the person introducing him included details in his potted biography seemingly found online in relation to another Eoin Ó Broin, then president of the University of Limerick students’ union. The two met a couple of years later, when Ó Broin (of Sinn Féin) joined a Shell to Sea protest, alighting a bus in Ballinaboy to see “this fella looking at me”. “And I’m look at him, and I’m going: ‘Are you Eoin Ó Broin?’ And he goes: ‘Are you Eoin Ó Broin’? So we had a big chat.” The Social Democrats’ Eoin is a fluent Irish speaker, having attended Irish-medium schools in Clondalkin; there is a large Irish-speaking community in the area, associated with the longstanding Áras Chrónáin cultural centre. Sinn Féin’s Eoin doesn’t speak Irish, but the Irish language surname is on his birth cert; his father attended a Gaelscoil. A few streets away, earlier that day, the Soc Dems’ Eoin Ó Broin doesn’t let the freezing rain stop him from going door to door. Like his fellow Eoin, he’s out twice a day as the election approaches. His biggest pitch to voters, apart from his own track record as a councillor (he got the council to fix a footpath in this particular estate), is his party’s commitment to Sláintecare – the plan to reform healthcare to end the current two-tier system, a policy with which Social Democrats founder Róisín Shortall has been particularly associated. He believes small parties need to be strategic, and the Social Democrats can position themselves as authoritatively on universal access to healthcare as his namesake has managed to do on housing. He adds that he believes Sláintecare would be “transformative” not only for healthcare but for citizens’ relationship with society and the state in Ireland. “I’ve seen a one-tier health system in Sweden, when I lived there. I didn’t need health insurance, and a trip to the doctor was a tenner,” the Soc Dems’ Ó Broin says. “It gives everybody a sense that they’re getting something back. They don’t have this unfortunate bitterness which exists [among] those who are above thresholds.” He believes the Irish system of means-tested thresholds for medical cards is a “Victorian charity” approach, whereas universal access would be “a game changer we need in Ireland for people to feel that we’re all in this together.” Advertisement The Soc Dems’ Ó Broin completed a PhD in energy systems modelling in Sweden, before undertaking postdoctoral research in France. With his background in environmental science, he was a member of the Green movement when he lived in Sweden, but he believes the Green Party do not sufficiently prioritise housing and workers’ rights. In the estate he’s canvassing today, he meets some voters who say he’ll get their number one, and a few undecideds. Do people bring up the name much? “Yeah. Some people say, ‘this will be fun’. Some people say, ‘that’s confusing, you should change your name’.” He is not impressed by this suggestion. “You know, you don’t just change your name. I grew up in Clondalkin, I went to the all-Irish school here, so because I grew up here and it is my name, why should I change?” the Soc Dems candidate says. (Although Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin has been living in Clondalkin for many years with his partner, Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan, he is originally from Cabinteely and went to school in Blackrock. A blow-in Ó Broin, if you will.) Election posters in Clondalkin for Eoin Ó Broin and Eoin Ó Broin. The Journal The Journal Housing, waiting times for healthcare and access to supports for those with disabilities and additional needs are among the top issues that come up on the doorsteps in Clondalkin. Access to school places is also a big issue in this area, where public services do not seem to have kept pace with population growth. Both Eoin Ó Broins say the heat has somewhat gone out of the issue of immigration, relative to the local elections in June; this mirrors what The Journal heard from other constituencies. However, immigration is definitely still on the agenda, and it’s raised a few times with Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin. He pushes back hard against the idea that immigrants are being prioritised on the housing list, as one Sinn Féin voter alleges, telling the man that that “every single one of those families” waited on the list for the same length of time as Irish families. “The only people who get council houses are people who have a legal right to reside and work with the state,” he says. However at another house (also voting Sinn Féin) he criticises the government for not consulting with the local community on a nearby accommodation centre for people seeking international protection. He tells a couple who say they’re concerned about the safety of women in the area that “a lot of concerns that you have, which are genuine concerns, can be addressed” through immigration being “properly managed”. “It’s the fear of not knowing what’s going on in your own community, and that’s why, for me, community engagement and consultation is key, right? People are gonna come, right? You can’t stop people coming, but what you have to make sure is when people arrive to claim international protection, there’s a proper process,” Ó Broin tells them. It is understood there have not been any incidents affecting the safety of local residents involving residents of this accommodation centre. Sinn Féin’s immigration manifesto, launched last week, promises to take the provision of accommodation for international protection applicants into complete state control, and pledges that new purpose built centres will not be located in deprived communities. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin explains that to protect “community cohesion”, good quality accommodation has to provided in communities that “have capacity”, not in those that have been marginalised, and which are struggling already with a lack of basic infrastructure. He says these areas are identifiable using the deprivation index produced by Pobal, the state’s social inclusion agency. By that metric, would areas in this constituency be suitable for new centres – in, say, Lucan, much of which is classified as “affluent” or “very affluent” by Pobal? Ó Broin seems to accept this could indeed by the case, telling The Journal that “the definition of ‘deprived’ is objective, and it has to be”, and adding that “large parts of Dublin city” would be deemed suitable for new centres under Sinn Féin’s plan. However, he adds that Sinn Féin would additionally require audits of local services to check whether there are enough school places and GP places before new accommodation for international protection applicants is approved. Related Reads Soc Dems pledge to spend €5.5 billion on disability legislation reform if in Government 'We want to go into government': SocDems says 50,000 affordable homes is red line issue It sounds like you could rule out almost every area of Dublin with those additional criteria? “No, I don’t believe that,” Ó Broin says, reiteriating that he “absolutely” believes there are areas of Dublin that would right now be suitable for new asylum accommodation. He adds that while he advocates for more community consultation, he does not believe anyone should get a “veto” in the same way that nobody gets to veto Irish people moving into their area. “It’s about respect. It’s about engagement. It’s about talking to people, letting people know what the plan is,” he says. Sinn Féin wants to lead Ireland’s first left-wing government after the election, so if it gets enough seats there’s no doubt Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns will be getting a call from her counterpart, Mary Lou McDonald. For her part, Cairns has indicated she hasn’t ruled out taking that call and talking to Sinn Féin. What do the two Eoin Ó Broins think are the biggest points of difference between their parties? Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin says: “Sinn Fein is the only political party that can lead an alternative government of change. So if people want a change of government, they really need to think wisely as to where they give that vote.” He adds that there are “significant policy differences” between the two parties; the examples he gives are USC (Sinn Féin wants to reduce this tax and the Social Democrats don’t) and the fact that a united Ireland is a “key part of [Sinn Féin's] agenda”. He acknowledges that on healthcare and childcare the two parties’ policies “chime”, but claims Sinn Féin’s housing and other policies are more comprehensive. The other Eoin Ó Broin says the Social Democrats are a “coherent, centre-left party in an international left-wing tradition, whereas Sinn Féin struggle to define where they are politically”. “Migration is a good example,” he says, instancing Sinn Féin’s election literature ahead of the June local elections, which stated that the party was opposed to open borders. “That’s rhetoric borrowed from the United States. The EU has open borders by default. There’s an open border with Northern Ireland that they fought very hard to keep. So it’s that kind of inconsistency, I would say, which differentiates us,” the Social Democrats’ Ó Broin says. He adds that he believes it to be “disingenuous to people” for Sinn Féin “put it out there that we can have a society without property taxes or carbon taxes”. “We’re solid that we want healthcare, education, childcare, elderly care, to be available free at the point of use and paid for by tax, and we’re strong on the environment as well,” he adds. Dublin Mid-West gains an extra seat in this election, so Sinn Féin will be hoping it can once again return two TDs, Ó Broin and Mark Ward. Fine Gael TD Emer Higgins will also try to bring in a running mate, while Fianna Fáil, which lost its seat in 2020, is also running two candidates. People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny is running again. The Social Democrats aren’t the only party to have poached an Independent councillor – Labour has nabbed Clondalkin’s longstanding council poll-topper, Francis Timmons. Independent councillor and former Green Party TD Paul Gogarty, who topped the poll in the June elections in Lucan, could benefit from the fact that the incumbent TDs skew to the Clondalkin end of the constituency, while Independent Ireland councillor Linda de Courcey is running on an immigration platform. There are also candidates from the Greens and Aontú, as well as the anti-EU Irish Freedom Party and anti-immigration Irish People Party, along with other Independents.

Title: Bitcoin Barrels Close To $98,000—Is The $100K Barrier Next?

Bitcoin continues its price explosion this Thursday, hitting a new all-time high and breaking the $97,000 barrier during intra-day trading. The crypto asset’s price then spiked 5.7%, reaching $97,811 on Bitstamp, boosting its market cap to $1.93 trillion. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value is not just a market trend, but a reflection of the growing optimism surrounding incoming US President Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies and his pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief. This optimism has led to a 3% increase in the cumulative cryptocurrency market cap, now standing at $3.37 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume on Thursday saw a 5% increase, reaching $ 190 billion. The obvious sign of the optimistic trend in the bitcoin market: its price has more than doubled this year. The whole industry has joined the upward surge, contributing an amazing $900 billion to the total crypto market capitalization. Given that Bitcoin is barely $3,000 short of the $100,000 milestone, the sector is bursting with hope about what the next few weeks can bring for the digital asset. According to Edu Patel, CEO of Mudrex, Bitcoin’s price last year was $30,000. Today, the asset’s price surged to more than $97,000, reflecting a growth of over 300%. Patel said several factors are pushing Bitcoin’s price, including Trump’s election and optimism over his pick as chairman of the SEC, and his friendly crypto policies. In addition, he also acknowledged the growing institutional participation in Bitcoin options and ETFs. The recent price surge of Bitcoin underscores the growing importance of the asset and cryptocurrency to the economy. The Trump administration has also signaled the possibility of creating a specific office to oversee the administration’s cryptocurrency policies. According to some sources, the president’s team is currently considering this office, and many crypto execs are jockeying for an audience with the president. 1/ MicroStrategy just convinced investors to pay $520,234 per Bitcoin That’s the biggest Bitcoin play I’ve ever seen: pic.twitter.com/yeZfGlcm6j — ELI5 of TLDR (@explain_briefly) November 20, 2024 Some experts also attribute Bitcoin’s recent run to MicroStrategy’s bold “Bitcoin-first” policy. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy has doubled down on this approach and purchased additional BTC to boost its portfolio. Other companies have followed suit and are planning to add the asset to their inventories. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs also helps, and the market currently benefits from the introduction of options trading. According to multiple sources, more than $4 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs since the November elections. Also, this week, Reuters reports that BlackRock is off to an exciting start with its BTC ETFs with call options.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Do Redditors Think That Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Has a Big Upside Potential?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Reddit Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) stands against the other Redditor-approved stocks. Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, together with Dana D'Auria, Envestnet co-chief Investment Officer, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell: Overtime' on November 12 to discuss the market's reaction to the election results and earnings. Paul Hickey believes that the AI bull market is likely to continue now. This recent conversation centered around the key forces to watch in the current political and economic landscape, particularly in light of potential energy impacts from Ukraine, shifts in Middle Eastern policies, and possible market effects from trade policies with China. Hickey thinks that as President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet begins to take shape, it will provide clearer insights into future expectations. He emphasized that while election results can lower barriers to the market and reduce speed bumps, their impact is often overstated. He notes that over the past 16 years, the market has shown strong performance under different administrations, with annualized returns of 16.3% during both Barack Obama’s and Donald Trump’s first terms, and 14% under Joe Biden. This consistency, according to Hickey, suggests that market returns have remained relatively stable despite varying political landscapes. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing AI bull market, which has been broadening since the summer and is expected to continue. The S&P 500 recently closed above 6,000, reflecting positive momentum in the markets, including gains in the NASDAQ. There was a discussion about how a sweeping victory for one party could have been perceived as detrimental to equities; however, Republicans achieved this outcome and equities responded positively. To maintain this momentum, D'Auria suggested that Republicans might need to exercise more fiscal responsibility. The implication is that a single party cannot implement all its plans without consideration of fiscal implications. D'Auria thinks that as tax cuts from 2017 are likely to be extended under Republican leadership, inflation concerns may arise due to higher tariffs and increased government spending. The Republican stance thus far has been viewed as pro-business, which is reflected in current market performance. However, a potential challenge lies ahead; she is of the idea that stocks are now being priced with expectations of a low regulatory environment. This regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining market growth moving forward. As the market continues to react positively to political developments and the ongoing AI bull market, investors should consider focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. In that context, we're here with a list of the 11 Reddit stocks with biggest upside potential to help you diversify your portfolio. Methodology We sifted through Reddit threads to compile a list of 30 trending stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 11 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A solar panel array stretched across a large open field, its glimmering panels reflecting the sun. Average Upside Potential as of November 11: 59.76% Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, and sells home energy solutions, including solar microinverters, batteries, and EV chargers. It offers cloud-based monitoring and control and sells its products to distributors, installers, and homeowners. A microinverter is a small electronic device that converts direct-current electricity produced by a solar panel into alternating-current electricity that homes and businesses can use. This company's IQ microinverters are expanding into new markets, including Japan, where the company is targeting a 1.3 gigawatt market. The IQ8P commercial microinverter is gaining traction in the US, with over 380 sites installed. It is also developing the IQ9 microinverter, powered by Gallium Nitride technology, which will offer higher power output and support elevated AC grid voltages. The company reported a 30.89% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3, reaching $380.87 million. Despite this, Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) saw a 13% sequential growth, shipping 1.73 million microinverters and 172.9 megawatt-hours of IQ batteries. It is poised to capitalize on international markets, especially in Brazil, India, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Currently, the main driver for its growth remains the US market, where revenue increased 43% sequentially. While the company has faced challenges due to the declining solar demand and rising interest rates, its long-term growth prospects remain promising. Overall ENPH ranks 11th on our list of the Reddit stocks with biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ENPH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ENPH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Prior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected. The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time. Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that. Read more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest? “With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance. “And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.” But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand. “It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.” For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips. The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible. As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need. “Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.” In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday. This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

Title: A Look Back On The Best And Worst Industries For Job Seekers In 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/karadennison/2024/11/21/a-look-back-on-the-best-and-worst-industries-for-job-seekers-in-2024/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T19:27:37Z
Full Content:
A Look Back on The Best and Worst Industries for Job Seekers in 2024 In a year marked by technological breakthroughs and shifting consumer preferences, certain industries have emerged as clear frontrunners in the global economy. From artificial intelligence disrupting traditional business models to healthcare innovations addressing growing demographic demands, 2024 has witnessed remarkable growth across several key sectors, even if it’s felt like a tough market for job seekers. On the other hand, traditional industries have struggled to keep pace with the evolving business environment, facing challenges from automation, changing consumer behaviors, and digital alternatives. Let’s take a look back on the best and worst industries for job seekers in 2024 and prepare for the new year. It’s no surprise that AI has established itself as the undisputed leader in industry growth. With private investment in generative AI projects reaching an astounding $25 billion in 2023, according to Stanford University research, the industry shows no signs of slowing down. The AI market is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027, driven by widespread adoption across sectors, marking AI a hot industry for those looking at an upcoming job search. Healthcare continues to dominate job creation, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting it will account for 45% of all U.S. job gains over the 2022-2032 decade. The sector's growth spans multiple areas, from personal care aides to nurse practitioners and medical service managers. Healthcare is a great industry to look into, even if you don’t have a traditional healthcare background, as healthcare organizations will need operational and technological support as they continue to scale. E-commerce has further solidified its position as a cornerstone of the retail economy, with the Census Bureau reporting that the industry reached a valuation of $1.1 trillion at the end of 2023, and that number keeps climbing. E-commerce accounts for 16.2% of global retail sales as of Q3 of this year, totaling $288.8 billion for Q3 alone, a 7.5% increase from 2023’s Q3 numbers, representing a significant shift in consumer shopping habits. This growth in e-commerce has created robust demand for roles in logistics, supply chain management, and digital marketing. The cybersecurity sector has become increasingly critical over the last few years with the fluctuation of remote, hybrid, and return-to-office shifts. The industry has responded to a troubling $8 trillion in cyber attack losses in 2023 with robust growth in security solutions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 32% growth in information security jobs over the coming decade, with information security and cybersecurity professionals commanding average annual salaries exceeding $120,000. The travel industry has shown remarkable recovery after the pandemic, with the World Travel & Tourism Council reporting an increase of 27 million global tourism jobs in 2023. Air travel, hotel occupancy, and international tourism have returned to near pre-pandemic levels, and could hit a new record this Thanksgiving, as about nearly 80 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles away from home during the holiday. The travel industry is vast and incorporates hospitality, transportation, and tourism, and many roles are needed across all sectors within this industry, from sales, marketing, development, logistics, customer service, and more. As organizations invest in infrastructure upgrades, commercial office space focused on employee engagement during return-to-office mandates, and leveraging sustainability practices, the construction industry is in demand. Construction companies that are innovative and provide unique solutions, such as mobile offices, modular and shared spaces, and buildings that can be adaptable for multiple uses, will be in high demand. This industry will be in need of creative tradespeople, innovative leaders, and real estate experts who will be able to partner with organizations looking to grow their physical footprint. With the rise of automation, robotic processing, and 3D printing, advanced manufacturing transforms production by driving productivity, efficiency, and total units produced. Advanced manufacturing is responsible for producing cutting-edge products across almost every industry and is creating a host of new roles from supply chain management, engineering, systems and team management, technology, process improvement, and more. The renewable energy sector has maintained strong momentum, accounting for 10% of global GDP growth, approximately $320 billion, in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. The Inflation Reduction Act's substantial funding for clean energy projects has created numerous opportunities across the sector, from solar panel installation to engineering and supply chain management. It remains to be seen if this will continue to be a growth industry during the upcoming administration. There are several key factors that have fueled explosive growth in these industries: Technological advancement is the most significant driver, transforming how businesses operate and consumers engage with products and services. The rapid evolution of AI, machine learning, and renewable energy technologies has created new possibilities for automation and efficiency while developing entirely new business models and service offerings. Changing consumer preferences have played a pivotal role, particularly in accelerating digital adoption and environmental awareness. The post-pandemic shift in consumer behavior has permanently altered how people shop, work, and access services, benefiting industries that facilitate digital interactions and remote capabilities like telehealth and e-commerce. Recent government policy and regulatory support have provided crucial momentum, particularly in sectors like green energy and healthcare. The financial support for clean energy has created a robust foundation for sustainable industry growth, while healthcare legislation has helped expand access to services and drive innovation in patient care and medical treatments. Demographic shifts have emerged as another significant growth driver, particularly in healthcare and related services. An aging population, combined with increased life expectancy, has created sustained demand for medical services, home care, and innovative health technologies. The technology sector has faced perhaps the most significant headwinds in 2024, with widespread layoffs affecting industry giants and smaller players. Tech companies have been particularly aggressive in workforce reductions, with major players like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM all announcing significant reductions in force. Cisco Systems alone cut 7% of its global workforce as part of a restructuring plan in August of this year, while Amazon has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs across divisions, including AWS, Prime Video, and MGM Studios. The automotive industry has shown significant signs of stress, particularly in the electric vehicle segment. Tesla announced plans to cut more than 10% of its global workforce in April, citing duplication of roles and the need for organizational streamlining. This was followed by Lucid Motors reducing its workforce by 6%, highlighting the challenges facing EV manufacturers in an increasingly competitive market. Media and entertainment companies have experienced substantial contractions throughout 2024. Paramount Global cut 3% of its workforce, roughly about 800 jobs, as the company navigates the decline of traditional cable television. The Los Angeles Times laid off 94 journalists, while Pixar Animation Studios reduced its workforce by 14%, impacting about 175 employees. These cuts reflect the industry's struggle to adapt to changing consumption patterns and the shift toward streaming services. As businesses evolve, job seekers need a strategic approach to capitalize on emerging opportunities. There are many ways to do that, but here are the top ones to have in mind: Start by developing a comprehensive job search plan that aligns with current market demands. High-growth areas like cybersecurity, manufacturing, and healthcare services deserve particular attention as these sectors continue to show demand. Be sure to set goals in your search, like specific salary expectations, desired benefits, and preferred work arrangements, and determine what is a non-negotiable and what you can negotiate on to enable you to focus on what’s most important to you and your career growth. Beyond understanding basic company information, investigate workplace culture, industry trends, work policies, and technological adoption rates. Learn how you can make an impact within your industry or a new one by pointing out your transferable experience, the impact you’ve made at past companies, and leading with your results and achievements. Additionally, with only 10% of job listings offering remote options despite receiving 46% of applications, carefully evaluate your flexibility requirements regarding work arrangements and factor this into your search strategy. Develop your personal brand with particular emphasis on impact, results, transferable skills, and soft skills. With 79% of leaders believing technical skills have a five-year shelf life, companies increasingly value adaptability, executive communication, and leadership potential. Your personal brand is not just your resume but how you’re showing up and contributing to your industry. Create a powerful LinkedIn profile with content that showcases these abilities, and ensure your digital presence aligns with your career objectives. Cohesive, clear, and direct branding will help eliminate confusion for hiring managers and recruiters. If you’re struggling, hire a career coach or resume writer that you trust to tell your career story with you. The investment can have long term benefits for your career beyond landing your next role. While online job boards remain the go-to for job seekers in their search, it’s increasingly becoming the lowest return on your time and energy investment. Between ghost jobs, automatic rejection emails, and recruiters inundated with resumes copied and pasted from the job description, networking has become increasingly important when it comes to landing your next role. Attend industry conferences, participate in professional communities, and leverage LinkedIn for industry connections. 84% of companies believe that employee referrals are the most cost-effective way to hire, according to a study done by Aptitude Research, and referrals are ranked as the number one top source of hire. Employee referrals also account for a 62% reduction in time-to-fill a role, a 24% improvement in the candidate experience, a 2X improvement in first-year retention, and a 2X more likely improvement in the quality of the hire. This shows that companies see the value in employee referrals across strong and weak economies, and referrals tend to be the highest-valued hire. If you’re considering entering a job search at the beginning of the year, having the right strategy is important, which includes understanding what industries will be in demand, how to adapt to these career shifts, maintaining a clear focus on your objectives, and leveraging the right strategy to separate yourself from the crowd of job seekers clogging the job boards by leveraging networking and referrals.

Title: Nvidia is in for larger beats as Blackwell rolls out, analysts say
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-larger-beats-blackwell-ai-chip-ship-q3-earnings-1851704918
Time Published: 2024-11-21T17:55:00Z

Despite Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) modest guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter, analysts are anticipating larger earnings beats on strong demand for its new artificial intelligence platform. The chipmaker set its fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above expectations of $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.34%). Nvidia’s expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter were “likely hampered by ongoing Blackwell shipment constraints,” Kunjan Sobhani, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. Nvidia chief executive Colette Kress said both Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are facing certain supply constraints, and that Blackwell demand is expected to exceed supply into fiscal year 2026. The modest guidance sent Nvidia’s shares slightly down in after-hours trading on Wednesday into Thursday morning. “Unfortunately, market participants have become too short-term oriented,” Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Absolute good reports seem less interesting than relatively less good but still good. There is nothing wrong with NVDA, I suggest investors use any weakness to buy the stock because demand will be satisfied at some point and these slight misses will turn into big beats yet again.” On the company’s earnings call, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said production of its Blackwell AI platform “is in full steam” after a design flaw was fixed, and that the company expects to deliver more Blackwells in this quarter than previously estimated. In the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia said it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell chips to customers. “The supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we’re going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year,” Huang said. Nvidia is likely “sold out” of Blackwell until the end of next year, and “has much better visibility in its forecasts than it is letting on,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. “This allows it to offer guidance that it knows it can beat by a small margin, which will help the share price hold onto the massive rally it has enjoyed over the last 18 months,” Windsor said. Nvidia’s shares are up over 198% so far this year. Concerns with Blackwell’s commercial deliveries have not reflected in Nvidia’s earnings reports yet, likely because issues mostly center on data center infrastructure around the chips, and because customers don’t want “to lose their place in the queue” and are therefore buying Blackwell and fixing issues after, Windsor said. Huang addressed a report that Blackwell chips are overheating in custom-designed server racks, saying “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” He also said Nvidia plans “to execute on our annual road map” of producing new chips. Jefferies (JEF+2.33%) analysts said in a note that they “are not overly concerned with any of the issues on this call” and that they “see increasing beats as Blackwell ramps.” But strong demand for Blackwell and Nvidia’s ability to deliver to customers despite production issues might not sustain growth in the long-term. “Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for NVIDIA compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their ROI on AI compute,” analysts at D.A. Davidson said in a note. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple Stock In 2025: A Prediction On Where It's Price May Head

Time Published: 2024-11-21T17:34:14Z

Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. If someone asked you to tell them the first thing you think of when you hear the word “apple,” your immediate response would probably say a lot about your age and what you have lived through. Maybe it would be a reference to Isaac Newton, who introduced the concept of gravity in the 1600s, and is the subject of a factually inaccurate story about an apple hitting him on the head. Or maybe it would be Apple, the record company famous for its longtime association with the Beatles. But the world-altering company started by a pair of college dropouts, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, in 1976 is likely what “apple” brings to mind first. That is, unless you’re a nutritionist. Apple (AAPL) is now a $3.4 trillion market cap company, whose product line of software and hardware have revolutionized personal communication and business productivity. It is its own ecosphere. But after decades of success, where is its stock price headed? Apple has grown revenue at an 8% rate the past five years, and carries a very manageable debt to equity ratio of less than 2.0. Its dividend yield was briefly high enough for some to consider it a yield stock last decade, but at 0.4% now, that yield only provides decent cash flow to the stock’s largest holders. Apple sells for 37x trailing earnings per share, and 30x next year’s earnings, which are both lofty figures. Through mid-November, the Apple stock was up 17%, well behind the S&P 500’s 24% return and the Nasdaq 100’s 23% gain. The stock is more than 8% of the latter index’s total value and more than 6% of the former’s weighting. So it is clearly a prominent stock, and its price has benefited from the massive inflows to index funds that track those popular market benchmarks.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. Apple is still true to Jobs’ vision of “delighting and surprising” consumers, particularly in the middle to upper end of the consumer market. Cost control is a priority, as is maintaining profit margins and a dominant market share in the areas in which it competes. In recent years, it has expanded its App Store, and its brick and mortar Apple stores have brought it to the people it serves, enhancing an already iconic culture. The iPhone is the leading source of revenue. Apple generated more than $46 billion in revenue from that segment alone during its latest quarter. However, iPads, Mac computers, watches, streaming video and the entire service component are also critical to the company’s continued growth. However, iPhone, now in its 16 version, is a mature business, and perhaps a victim of its own success, as adding updated versions of existing products is less profitable than the next new device or technology. Upgrade cycles contribute more to the company’s bottom line than innovation. That was not always the case. And the company has a new challenge, given its reliance on China, both for production and sales of Apple products. The iPhone is truly the centerpiece of the business, as other products are essentially designed around it. That is especially true of new applications, such as subscription bundles and augmented reality. With $25 billion in service segment revenue in the most recent quarter, this continues to be a driver for Apple. This includes iTunes, digital content, AppleCare, Apple Pay and licensing segments. This is a central part of the company’s future growth, as it provides a second juggernaut business line that makes up for potential cyclicality that has crept into the hardware segment as the company’s products are now so widely owned. Global expansion is an ever-present project for the U.S.-based Apple. The company has helped its own growth in relatively poorer countries by offering installment plan purchases. That has helped it expand in Europe and China, and it now has its sites set on deeper penetration of emerging economies.

As with many market sectors, Apple is likely to be impacted by the dramatic turn of events in Washington D.C. The new administration is determined to reshore manufacturing, and become more inwardly-focused. Apple, as a prominent global manufacturer, is going to have to navigate that situation, and it is way too early to determine how that will work out. This may be where its oligopolistic nature and confirmed industry leadership provides a strong backstop. Based on estimates compiled by Seeking Alpha, Apple is projected to earn $415 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025, which ends next September. That implies a price to sales ratio of 8.2, which is not cheap. Earnings are expected to grow to $7.40 a share, which is certainly strong, but also not enough to make the stock inexpensive. As for sentiment, the best way to view that is in the chart pattern (at least, that’s my view after charting stocks for 44 years). On that measure, Apple is again a victim of its own success, but there is a potential silver lining. At around $225 a share, its price has stagnated while younger businesses like Nvidia (NVDA) have rocketed higher, the way Apple’s stock used to do. Apple’s chart is rangebound. However, its price has been trending up steadily, not dramatically, since back in August 2020, when it split its stock price 4-for-1. In 2025 and each successive year beyond that, Apple’s biggest challenge is not staying in business or producing massive revenue. It is too entrenched in too many areas for that to happen. However, being great doesn’t always impress Wall Street, especially when your stock is so richly valued. So what Apple will need to do going forward is to justify its valuation to investors. That is harder to do as a mature business than when it was proverbially taking over the world with its cutting-edge technology and innovation, changing our lives for the better. Over the past 18 months, Apple’s stock price has traded in a range from $165 to $235, and it currently sits near the top of that range. So a sustained breakout through that upper level will be needed for the stock to avoid disappointing investors in the coming year. And with the most recent path to its recent all time highs originating from the $190 area, that will be a key test if the stock breaks down. Apple is far from an upstart, but a cash-rich balance sheet, debt it can manage well, and a “wide moat” via its very devoted customer base all make this a stock that likely has a floor. However, it is a prominent part of the S&P 500, and that means it is always at risk of being caught up in market-wide selloffs. I judge the stock price to be vulnerable at these levels, both chart-wise and due to its hefty valuation. However, if any business can continue its run of being in Wall Street’s good graces, this is it. Post-U.S.-election policy, as well as Apple’s ability to continue expanding its global footprint. And, its success in avoiding disruption of its low-cost production efforts. It is growing, though not at the rate it was, and that growth is likely priced into the stock already. Apple recently scrapped its Project Titan, which aimed to develop a self-driving car to compete with Tesla and others. This ends about a decade of speculation and efforts in this area. Apple will settle instead for applying what it learned from that ill-fated project to other parts of its business, including Apple Carplay. “Safe” and “stock market investing” are two things that simply do not overlap. That is evidenced by the fact that this leading company’s stock has suffered numerous 50% drawdowns in its history, including an 81% peak-to-trough decline. The last big test for the broad stock market was in 2022, when the S&P 500 index fell 18%. Apple stock fell by 26%. So it is far from immune to macro market issues. That said, its strong financial condition is an above-average support mechanism for very long-term investors in the stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) weighed on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile.

"We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup.

The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth.

The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter.

The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail.

And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup.

Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues.

Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery.

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%.

The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail.

And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery.

Title: ASML Remains A Valid Medium-Term Investment Despite Weak Outlook
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/21/asml-remains-a-valid-medium-term-investment-despite-weak-outlook/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T16:08:27Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

Title: ASML Remains A Valid Medium-Term Investment Despite Weak Outlook
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/21/asml-remains-a-valid-medium-term-investment-despite-weak-outlook/

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) shares made a slight recovery at the market open on Thursday, before reversing and continuing its fall during after-hours and pre-market trading. The chipmaker’s shares were down by around 1.2% on Thursday morning but had climbed over 4% at the open. Nvidia’s stock was down by around 1% during pre-market trading on Thursday. Ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday, the chipmaker’s shares were down 0.75% at the market close. Its stock continued falling in after-hours trading — down 3.47% after releasing its fiscal third quarter results, and down 1.2% later in the evening. The company set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, but was expected to set guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet (FDS+0.34%) estimates. Nvidia would need fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion to maintain stock performance on earnings day, according to John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, in comments shared with Quartz ahead of earnings. After it reported fiscal second quarter earnings in August, Nvidia’s shares fell 6.9% in after-hours trading due to a lower-than-expected guidance for the fiscal third quarter.

How are young investors using dividend investing for early retirement? Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000.

Title: The War on Remote Work

Trying to find a balance isn't getting any easier. The Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental governing body headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is taking on remote work for government employees. The move by DOGE to reduce the federal workforce pushes back on remote work—especially if government workers quit as a result of the initiative. While 18% of the Fortune 500 companies require 100% full-time in-office work, it’s no secret that removing remote work as an option is reducing the workforce. A survey by BambooHR found that a quarter of VP and C-suite executives and a fifth of HR pros admitted to hoping for voluntary turnover after implementing a return-to-office policy. Is the push against remote work a strategy for low-cost layoffs, reducing an over-bloated workforce? Or, as the Wall Street Journal reports, is it an initiative designed to drive efficiency, collaboration and growth? Making plans for the future of work. Workers want remote options now more than ever, according to a survey from Buffer. According to the report, 98% of respondents would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Gallup polling found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term”, according to CNN reports. The Daily Mail says that not a single U.S. federal agency had over 50% office space utilization between January and December2023. Consider the cost of carrying that underused real estate on the taxpayers’ balance sheet. Underutilized real estate is part of the reason for the push against remote work. Consider office vacancies in cities like Salesforce, with iconic addresses in downtown San Francisco, New York, Indianapolis and other cities, issued a return to work policy that made headlines. San Francisco and Austin (the two top cities for unused commercial real estate, both tied at 27.7% vacancies, according to CommercialEdge) are cities struggling with utilization. While employees may howl at the mandates, companies have the right (and the shareholder responsibility) to maximize their assets. RTO is the battlefront of utilization, in the push against remote work. Here is a partial list of companies that have fully ended remote work, according to Tech.co: Justification of expenses is a challenge for any organization. Consider that, in a recent survey, 23% of workers at the Department of Commerce (that’s the government entity that handles business in the US) were found to be overpaid - because they did not tell their employer that they had moved to a less expensive area to work remote. Deception, not remote work, is the real issue here. But consider the possibilities, for workers. If given the choice while making the same salary: would you rather live in Abilene, Texas or the Washington, DC metro area? (That’s a cost of living difference of 56.42%, if you are curious). Flexibility and work-life balance are important to today’s workforce. The ability to live where you want, avoiding commutes and urban costs, can be a big advantage for your bottom line - and your family time. Ultimately, the reason any business organization exists is to return shareholder value. For many leaders today, RTO (return to office) mandates are becoming more common - because companies are working in their shareholders’ (or constituents’) best interests. For employees, those interests may require sacrifice: increasing time in the office...or increasing time in the job search. As Charles Dickens said, “Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?” That question seems to lie at the center of the push against remote work. Ultimately, work requires sacrifice - that’s why it’s called work. Time and talents are traded for salary and benefits. Reaching an equitable and fair equation in the workplace is the employment conflict of the ages. Or is that the “conflict of the wages”? Employment at will means that employers can dictate the terms. Employees decide where and how they work. But choices today are limited, tipping the scales in favor of employers. On the battleground of the labor market, only 12,000 new jobs were created in November 2024 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). And Bamboo reports that 70% of companies plan on increasing the required time in the office. For workers, both economic growth and labor force growth are on a declining trend. When choices are limited, workers must make difficult decisions. Those decisions center on what sacrifices are acceptable, and do-able, in the push against remote work. One Community. Many Voices.

In a remarkable display of market confidence, Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) Inc., the company renowned for its law enforcement technology, has achieved an all-time high, with its stock price soaring to $627.67. This milestone underscores a period of significant growth for the company, which has seen an impressive 172.34% increase over the past year. Investors have rallied behind Axon's innovative product line and strategic market positioning, propelling the stock to new heights and reflecting a robust demand for the company's offerings in the public safety sector. The 1-year change data not only highlights the company's strong performance but also suggests a bullish outlook among investors for Axon's future. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise Inc. reported a strong third-quarter performance during its earnings call, with a 32% year-over-year increase in Q3 revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.7%. The company's record bookings for Q3 surpassed $1 billion, demonstrating continued momentum. Axon's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and TASER products, including the TASER 10, has contributed to its success and potential for international expansion. The integration of its recent acquisition, Dedrone, along with the launch of new AI-driven products, has led to Axon raising its Q4 revenue guidance to $560-570 million and projecting its full-year revenue to exceed $2.07 billion. Despite a slight deceleration in software and annual recurring revenue growth due to timing and seasonality, Axon remains optimistic about its future. These developments are recent and illustrate Axon's commitment to enhancing public safety through technology and innovation. Axon Enterprise's recent stock performance aligns with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization has reached an impressive $47.41 billion, reflecting its strong position in the law enforcement technology sector. InvestingPro data shows that Axon's revenue growth remains robust, with a 32.32% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a 31.7% quarterly growth in Q3 2024. This growth trajectory supports the stock's remarkable 166.97% price return over the past year. InvestingPro Tips highlight Axon's financial strength, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and "liquid assets exceed short-term obligations." These factors contribute to Axon's financial stability and ability to invest in future growth. Additionally, the tip that "analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year" aligns with the company's recent performance and market optimism. It's worth noting that Axon is trading near its 52-week high, with the current price at 97.6% of that peak. While this indicates strong investor confidence, the InvestingPro Tip that the "RSI suggests the stock is in overbought territory" may warrant caution for potential investors. For those seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 23 additional tips on Axon Enterprise, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq slides as Nvidia, Alphabet lead 'Magnificent 7' tumble

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup.

Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026.

Title: What’s Happening With Google Stock?

Time Published: 2024-11-21T13:22:25Z

The Google logo displays on a smartphone screen in Reno, United States, on November 15, 2024. (Photo ... [+] by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been in the news lately, with the Department of Justice suggesting the sale of Google Chrome, and sharing data with rivals, among other measures to end its monopoly. The judge has set the trial on proposals for April 2025. Google will be given a chance to present its own proposals in December. [1] It was known that Google is facing antitrust cases and the remedies could be as extreme as selling the android platform. This overhang has also weighed on GOOG stock performance lately. Looking at a slightly longer period, GOOG stock has seen a 23% rise from levels of $144 in early 2022 to $177 now. This can primarily be attributed to: Google’s revenue growth over the recent years has been driven by its cloud business, which is seeing a strong momentum, with the segment sales surging a solid 72% between 2021 and 2023. However, its contribution of 11% to the company’s total sales is much smaller than 56% for its Google search business. The core search business is also doing well, with the company’s AI integration helping it to garner higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue in the near term. Looking at the latest quarter, Google’s revenue of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did the company see strong revenue growth, its profitability has improved. Alphabet’s operating income rose 34% from $79 billion in 2021 to $105 billion now. Its operating margin has improved slightly from 30.6% in 2021 to 30.9% in the last twelve months. With 26% gains this year, GOOG stock has fared marginally better than the broader S&P500 index, up 24%. However, the increase in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and Google’s antitrust case, could GOOG face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think its stock price appears to be fairly priced. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, broadly aligning with its current levels of $178. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 25x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. Now, Google has a monopoly with 90% of searches. The recent argument by prosecutors focused on the company’s search engine – Chrome – which is a widely used browser with over 3 billion users. Chrome is very important for Google, given that it acts as a gateway through which users access the search engine. The web browser alone could be worth as much as $20 billion. [2] Furthermore, the prosecutors stated that Google should share data it gathers from users with competitors. And, if the remedies fail to increase the competition, then Google should consider selling Android. None of these remedies would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term.

Weekly jobless claims due later Thursday will give the market insight into the labor market as they weigh the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest-rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury Secretary pick, as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed 5% to a fresh all-time high above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the "Trump trade," as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the the pre-market. From top to bottom, Target's results flat out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target could deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN). This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." Below I list out several of the challenges Target is up against. Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the pre-market after earnings last night. Makes sense as Jensen didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high-end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps production of its latest AI chip Blackwell. Usually during ramp periods costs are elevated, and profit margins not at peak levels. Notes Keybanc analyst John Vinh: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Title: Nvidia Reports Another Blowout Quarter—Here’s Why Its Stock Price Is Falling

Nvidia (NVDA) is retaining its title as the darling of the A.I. revolution—at least for the time being. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker reported record revenue yesterday (Nov. 20) for the July-September quarter that surpassed Wall Street’s already lofty expectations. Demand for Nvidia’s A.I. chips continues soaring, according to the company’s CEO Jensen Huang. “The age of A.I. is upon us and it’s large and diverse,” said Huang during an earnings call.

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s quarterly revenue jumped 94 percent to $35 billion while net income more than doubled to $19.3 billion. Before the A.I. boom, Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) were most used by the gaming industry. Today, the company’s data center business, which serves mostly A.I. clients, accounts for nearly 90 percent of its total revenue, bringing in $30.7 billion for the quarter compared with $14.5 billion last year. Gaming revenue, meanwhile, totaled at $3.2 billion. The rest of the company’s sales came from its automotive and professional visualization departments. Huang said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs, which began shipping this month, “is very strong” and production is “in full steam.” In recent months, Nvidia has struggled to meet demand for its Hopper chips. Despite a blowout quarter, Nvidia’s share price slipped nearly 2 percent after the earnings release. Some investors were spooked by the chipmaker’s $37.5 billion revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, which would represent a slowdown in the rapid growth witnessed during past quarters. The “conservative revenue forecast” is “a touch disappointing,” said Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at broker XTB, in an investor note. The company’s customer base is also increasingly concentrated. Cloud service providers, which include the likes of Amazon Web Services, accounted for around half of Nvidia’s data center revenue, compared with 45 percent during the same period a year ago. Nvidia’s reliance on this sector “could be a mild cause of concern” going forward, according to Brooks. While some players in the tech industry have also raised concerns that A.I. model improvements are hitting a plateau, Huang remains optimistic about their scaling potential. “Pre-training scaling is intact and its continuing,” said the CEO, adding that test-time compute research has also emerged as an additional and promising method of scaling. “As a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great.” Nvidia expects the A.I. hype will only continue as society embraces the technology. Besides predicting that machine learning will eventually replace coding, Huang noted that data centers around the world are being modernized into “A.I. factories” that will generate A.I. “just like we’ve generated electricity.” The early foundations of an A.I.-driven world are already evident in developments like the adoption of A.I. agents across workplaces and breakthroughs across physical A.I., said Huang. “We expect this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several more years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Inflation Data Unwinds Some of the Post-Election Rally Stocks soared on 11/6/24 on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration would issue business-friendly policies including relaxed regulations and additional tax cuts. The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date. The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration. October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings. Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices. For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%). There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations. PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point. The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase. Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months. The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18. According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather. In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Re ITW ELAN ELAN, SNOW, BDX, ITW, XEL BIDU GAP

Title: Nvidia reports solid Q3, stock down as guidance underwhelms lofty expectations

Investing.com - Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, but its current-quarter guidance underwhelmed lofty investor expectations amid red-hot AI demand. The company forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares initially fell roughly 3% in premarket trading Thursday, but rebounded 0.9% into positive territory after the market opened. The company announced Q3 earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.75 on revenue of $33.09B Data center revenue was $30.8B, up 17% from Q2 and up 112% from a year ago. That compared with estimates for $28.84B. Looking ahead to Q4, revenue is expected to be $37.5B, plus or minus 2%, compared with estimates of $37.09B. GAAP gross margins were expected to be 73.0%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Commenting on the print, Bank of America analysts said they "expect [the] stock to churn near-term as investors digest lack of “sizzle” but we continue to like the stock on its “substance”. They note that Nvidia remains the fastest-growing mega-cap company and the undisputed leader in converting $1 trillion of legacy infrastructure to accelerated systems, and continues to generate solid free cash flow (FCF). Separately, Piper Sandler analysts said Nvidia's report, despite missing elevated guidance expectations, sets up the chipmaker "for extremely strong growth starting in April." "The key here is that NVDA is going through a product transition with Blackwell ramping and H200 remaining strong," analysts led by Harsh V. Kumar wrote. "We also continue to believe that starting April, the beat cadence will be quite a bit higher than the $2B cadence NVDA has more or less maintained thus far," they added. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, which some believe represent the next frontier for the company, are expected to face supply constraints amid red-hot demand. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," Nvidia said on Wednesday. Yasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $35.1 billion for Q3, up 17% sequentially and 94% year-on-year, surpassing their outlook of $32.5 billion. Data center revenue reached a record $30.8 billion, with a 17% sequential increase and 112% year-on-year growth, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper and H200 products. NVIDIA's AI enterprise revenue is expected to more than double from last year, with a growing pipeline and annualizing software service and support revenue at $1.5 billion, projected to exceed $2 billion by year-end. The company is experiencing significant demand for its new Blackwell GPUs, with plans to exceed previous revenue estimates and ramp up supply to meet customer needs. NVIDIA's gaming revenue increased by 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year, supported by strong back-to-school sales and healthy channel inventory. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces supply constraints in gaming, which are expected to impact Q4 revenue despite strong sell-through in Q3. Gross margins are expected to moderate to the low 70s as Blackwell ramps up, with initial configurations potentially impacting profitability. Networking revenue was sequentially down, despite strong year-on-year growth, indicating potential challenges in meeting demand for networking components. The company anticipates competitive market conditions in China due to export controls, which could affect future data center revenue from the region. There are concerns about potential digestion phases in hardware deployment cycles, which could impact growth as the market adjusts to new technologies. Q: Can you discuss the debate around whether scaling for large language models has stalled and how NVIDIA is addressing this? A: Jensen Huang, President and CEO, explained that foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and continuing. NVIDIA is helping customers with post-training scaling and inference time scaling, which are driving demand for their infrastructures. The next generation of models starts with 100,000 Blackwells, indicating strong industry movement. Q: There were reports about heating issues with Blackwell. Can you address concerns about your ability to execute the roadmap with Ultra and Rubin? A: Jensen Huang assured that Blackwell production is in full steam, with more units being delivered than previously estimated. The supply chain is robust, and NVIDIA is on track with its annual roadmap, focusing on performance improvements and reducing AI costs. Q: How is Blackwell expected to ramp this year, and how will it affect gross margins? A: Colette Kress, CFO, stated that Blackwell will ramp with initial gross margins in the low 70s, improving to mid-70s as production scales. Jensen Huang added that Blackwell shipments will increase each quarter, with significant demand driven by shifts in computing from CPUs to GPUs. Q: Could NVIDIA recover to mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? A: Colette Kress confirmed that reaching mid-70s gross margin in the second half of next year is a reasonable assumption, depending on the mix of ramp. Q: Can you provide an update on Sovereign AI demand and explain the supply constraints in gaming? A: Colette Kress noted that Sovereign AI demand remains strong, with growth opportunities in regional clouds and AI factories. Gaming supply constraints are due to fast sell-through and efforts to ramp up supply, expected to improve in the new calendar year.

Title: Snowflake’s shares surge higher on blowout earnings, a promising acquisition and new AI partnership

UPDATED 20:17 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the cloud data warehouse company Snowflake Inc. jumped more than 30% in trading Thursday, with the bullish sentiment driven by a crushing earnings and revenue beat and increased guidance for the fiscal year. The company also announced a key partnership with the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic PBC and said it’s going to acquire the data integration startup Datavolo Inc., further boosting investor optimism. Snowflake reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 20 cents per share in the quarter, easily beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 15 cents. Revenue for the period rose 28% from a year ago, to $942 million, cruising past the Street’s target of $897 million. However, the strong numbers didn’t prevent Snowflake’s loss from widening. It reported a net loss of $324.3 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $214.3 million one year earlier. The company said product revenue accounted for 96% of its total sales. The company uses product revenue as its main guidance indicator, and it said it sees a total of $3.43 billion in fiscal 2025, which would imply growth of 29%. That’s up quite a bit from its previous product revenue forecast of $3.36 billion, issued three months ago. In addition, Snowflake said it’s now anticipating an adjusted operating margin of 5%, up from 3% earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) said the company intends to focus now on saving money with a view to increasing its profitability in the quarters ahead. “We’ve been creating centralized, more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster,” Ramaswamy said. However, the company’s chief financial officer Mike Scarpelli butted in to say that the company is not planning any layoffs in the foreseeable future, despite that reorganization. The company reported 10,618 paying customers at the end of October, up 369 from three months ago and above the Street’s target of 10,601 customers. One of those customers is the U.S. government, which generates only a very small fraction of its revenue at present. But Scarpelli told analysts that he sees significant room for growth. “We feel good about what we’re doing, and we think there’s a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years,” he said. No doubt part of that potential stems from Snowflake’s recent acquisition of a company called Night Shift Development Inc., a data analytics startup focused on the U.S. public sector. That acquisition was announced in September, when Snowflake said it will complement its ongoing investment in enabling more informed decision-making across government agencies. Snowflake’s cloud data warehouse offerings have become more relevant to enterprises thanks to the ongoing shift from traditional on-premises servers to the cloud. In recent months they have been further boosted by the growing demand for data to power artificial intelligence workloads. For years, the company has been viewed as a rival to public cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but at the same time, those companies are also key partners, providing it with its underlying infrastructure. Ramaswamy indicated that those partnerships are now taking on even more significance. “Through our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters,” he told analysts on the call. Third Bridge analyst Jordan Berger said the company’s strong revenue growth signals a return of strength and a subsidence of cost optimization headwinds that had held it back in recent quarters. “As an additional positive indication, after a period of sequential deceleration, its net revenue retention remained stable quarter-over-quarter at 127%,” the analyst said. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. praised Snowflake for its strong revenue growth, driven by enterprise’s hunger for data-driven insights, but said investors may be worried at its worsening profitability. “Snowflake’s growth is coming at an increased cost, with the company loosing $1 for every $3 it grabs in revenue,” the analyst pointed out. “On the plus side, its research and development costs have overtaken sales and marketing expenses, which suggests the company is accelerating innovation for AI-powered analytics and insights. But in the long run, investors will want to see Ramaswamy and his team find a way to put costs and revenue growth in sync, so they can work on boosting that bottom line.” The acquisition of Datavolo also looks to be an important move. Snowflake didn’t reveal how much it paid to acquire the startup, which had raised $25 million in funding and sells tools for building multimodal data pipelines for AI models. Ramaswamy said the acquisition will enable Snowflake to create more versatile data pipelines for its own customers. For instance, using Datavolo’s tools, a customer might be able to replace single-use data connectors with more flexible pipelines that facilitate the movement of information from the cloud, to on-premises servers, and then to Snowflake’s data warehouse. “By bringing Datavolo into the Snowflake fold, we are expanding how much of the data lifecycle Snowflake captures — unlocking both simplicity and cost savings for our customers, without any sacrifice to data extensibility,” Ramaswamy explained. As for the multiyear partnership with Anthropic, which is a rival to OpenAI, this is all about strengthening Snowflake’s hand in generative AI. The alliance means Anthropic’s most powerful Claude 3.5 models will be made accessible via Snowflake Cortex AI, which is a fully managed service for AI development that runs on AWS. Also, Snowflake’s AI agents, such as Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Analyst, will be able to leverage Claude. According to Snowflake’s executive vice president of product, Christian Kleinerman, Anthropic’s Claude models will help improve the ability of Snowflake’s AI agents to analyze data, run ad-hoc data analytics, create visualizations based on that information, and perform other multistep tasks. In addition, another benefit of the partnership is that Claude users will be able to leverage Snowflake’s Horizon Catalog service, which provides enterprise-grade compliance, security and privacy for Cortex AI. In other words, it means Claude can be secured with granular access controls and safety guardrails, ensuring more secure and trustworthy AI, Snowflake said. “Our partnership with Anthropic represents a massive leap forward in expanding on our promise to provide thousands of global customers with easy, efficient and trusted AI for a holistic set of enterprise use cases,” Kleinerman insisted. Despite the impressive after-hours gains, Snowflake’s stock is still down 35% in the year to date, compared with a gain of 24% in the broader S&P 500 index.

The offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Nvidia (NVDA) stock opened the year at about $50 per share (on a split-adjusted basis). As of late November 2024, the AI hardware giant stock's price had eclipsed $145 — that growth equates to a year-to-date market value increase of almost 195%. When one of the world's largest companies nearly triples in value over 11 months, investors take notice. You might naturally wonder if Nvidia will keep growing and, if so, whether you can benefit. To help you decide if you should invest in Nvidia, let's review key factors from the company's last earnings release and the questions you should consider before placing a buy order. Learn more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue and $0.81 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter. Revenue had increased by 94% from the prior-year quarter, and EPS rose 103% year over year. Learn more: Track Nvidia’s stock price here Notably, Nvidia generated nearly 88% of its revenue from its data center reporting segment, which includes the company's AI computing solutions. Data center revenues grew 112% year over year, outpacing the company's other three segments. Nvidia's gaming revenues grew 15%, professional visualization revenues were up 17%, and automotive and robotics revenues increased 72%. Nvidia first reported triple-digit data center revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now that the company has lapped those gains, comparisons will be more challenging going forward. Even so, Nvidia's leadership team expects more growth. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance is $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. This compares to revenue of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin expectation for the upcoming quarter is 73.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Nvidia has held its non-GAAP gross margin over 70% throughout this recent growth phase, since the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Latest news: Nvidia earnings, forecasts top expectations as 'age of AI is in full steam' Nvidia plans to ship its most powerful graphics processing units, or GPUs, to date later this year. The launch is one for investors to watch. According to Nvidia, the next-generation Blackwell chips will deliver more computing power with lower energy consumption than the company's industry-leading H100 chip. Nvidia recently reported positive test results for the Blackwell platform. Against MLPerf Training 4.1 industry benchmarks, Blackwell delivered up to 2.2 times more performance per GPU. MLPerf benchmarks are developed by a consortium of AI leaders from multiple disciplines to evaluate workloads for machine-learning workflows. If Blackwell chips live up to expectations, it could spark another wave of strong AI hardware demand. Video: Nvidia's Blackwell and what it means for AI chip demand in 2025 Nvidia has business momentum, but that does not solely justify a decision to invest. An ownership position in the chip designer only makes sense when it aligns with your risk tolerance, investing goals, and interests. Before you buy, test this alignment using the eight questions below. Nvidia lost 50% of its value in 2022. The company also fell nearly 83% in 2002 after the dot-com bubble burst. The stock recovered from both declines eventually, but Nvidia remains a high-volatility position. The potential for large value changes, up or down, should influence how much Nvidia stock, if any, you want to own. Diversifying your holdings beyond Nvidia provides some protection from future volatility. Consider setting a cap on your relative Nvidia exposure based on your risk tolerance. A conservative approach, for example, would be limiting the value of your Nvidia stock to 1% of your portfolio. At this allocation, Nvidia could fall dramatically, and your net worth would remain largely intact. Nvidia pays a dividend, but it is not a good dividend stock. The dividend yield of 0.03% compares poorly to yields on cash savings accounts and many other S&P 500 stocks. For comparison, the average cash deposit rate in the U.S. is 0.43% and the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.24% as of Nov. 19. If income is your primary investing goal, there are better options than Nvidia. Learn more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide Nvidia's stock price is high relative to its historic sales and earnings. Investors buying Nvidia today largely believe the company's future earnings will justify the current price tag. This is a common rationale for growth stocks, but it comes with risk. Stocks that trade at high prices relative to earnings can be volatile. The stock price moves higher on investor optimism but may fall quickly if earnings fail to meet future expectations. If you prefer a safer approach, you could wait until Nvidia's price dips before you buy. As long as the decline is related to investor sentiment or a temporary circumstance, it should not affect the company's long-term potential. The optimistic outlook for Nvidia relies on continued AI infrastructure spending. Multiple researchers and analysts believe the AI technology buildout still has years of growth ahead. However, research and advisory firm Forrester notes that "only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024," despite billions spent on AI infrastructure in 2023. AI implementations must deliver returns, or the trajectory of spending on data center infrastructure will change. A spending decline could challenge Nvidia's efforts to meet investor expectations. The Department of Commerce has proposed new rules limiting the export of high-powered semiconductors and related technologies. The rules are intended to prevent foreign adversaries from developing technology that could threaten national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. is enforcing its existing export restrictions. In November 2024, the Department of Commerce ordered Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), a major supplier to Nvidia, to stop shipping high-powered chips to Chinese customers. Existing and new semiconductor export restrictions limit Nvidia's opportunity in China, which is a sizable market. Statista estimates the Chinese chip sales totaled $185 billion in 2023. If you intend to invest in Nvidia, plan on following these regulatory developments and evaluating their ongoing impact on the business. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Nvidia competitor, is also targeting the AI chip market. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has raised the company's R&D budget dramatically and made a string of acquisitions to broaden AMD's AI resources and expertise. AMD does not have a meaningful market share in AI chips today, but the company says its newest chip, the MI325X, is more powerful than Nvidia's H200. As a prospective Nvidia investor, you might consider analyzing a competitor like AMD to understand its capabilities and how they could affect Nvidia's prospects. Nvidia also faces competition from the major cloud computing providers: Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). These tech giants, currently among Nvidia's largest customers, are developing their own AI chips to avoid being overly dependent on Nvidia. It is always smart to define your sell parameters before buying any stock, especially the volatile ones. Sell triggers can be positive developments that push the stock price higher and create profit-taking opportunities. Or, triggers can be negative circumstances that permanently dampen the company's outlook. Having documented sell triggers can discourage you from making an emotionally driven decision to liquidate. With Nvidia's history of price declines and recoveries, a rash decision to sell could leave you watching from the sidelines as the stock returns to growth. Only you can decide if the risks associated with Nvidia stock are worth the rewards. Learn the business, know your risk tolerance, and choose a position size that makes sense. Remember that you can always add to your Nvidia holdings once you become comfortable with its behavior. A robo-advisor is a digital investment platform that automatically builds you a portfolio and rebalances it over time. Learn more about how they work, how they compare to financial advisors, the cost, and more.

Learn more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue and $0.81 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter. Revenue had increased by 94% from the prior-year quarter, and EPS rose 103% year over year.

Data center revenues grew 112% year over year, outpacing the company's other three segments. Nvidia's gaming revenues grew 15%, professional visualization revenues were up 17%, and automotive and robotics revenues increased 72%. Nvidia first reported triple-digit data center revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now that the company has lapped those gains, comparisons will be more challenging going forward. Even so, Nvidia's leadership team expects more growth. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance is $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. This compares to revenue of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin expectation for the upcoming quarter is 73.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Nvidia has held its non-GAAP gross margin over 70% throughout this recent growth phase, since the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Latest news: Nvidia earnings, forecasts top expectations as 'age of AI is in full steam' Nvidia plans to ship its most powerful graphics processing units, or GPUs, to date later this year. The launch is one for investors to watch. According to Nvidia, the next-generation Blackwell chips will deliver more computing power with lower energy consumption than the company's industry-leading H100 chip. Nvidia recently reported positive test results for the Blackwell platform. Against MLPerf Training 4.1 industry benchmarks, Blackwell delivered up to 2.2 times more performance per GPU. MLPerf benchmarks are developed by a consortium of AI leaders from multiple disciplines to evaluate workloads for machine-learning workflows. If Blackwell chips live up to expectations, it could spark another wave of strong AI hardware demand. Video: Nvidia's Blackwell and what it means for AI chip demand in 2025 Nvidia has business momentum, but that does not solely justify a decision to invest. An ownership position in the chip designer only makes sense when it aligns with your risk tolerance, investing goals, and interests. Before you buy, test this alignment using the eight questions below. Nvidia lost 50% of its value in 2022. The company also fell nearly 83% in 2002 after the dot-com bubble burst. The stock recovered from both declines eventually, but Nvidia remains a high-volatility position. The potential for large value changes, up or down, should influence how much Nvidia stock, if any, you want to own. Diversifying your holdings beyond Nvidia provides some protection from future volatility. Consider setting a cap on your relative Nvidia exposure based on your risk tolerance. A conservative approach, for example, would be limiting the value of your Nvidia stock to 1% of your portfolio. At this allocation, Nvidia could fall dramatically, and your net worth would remain largely intact. Nvidia pays a dividend, but it is not a good dividend stock. The dividend yield of 0.03% compares poorly to yields on cash savings accounts and many other S&P 500 stocks. For comparison, the average cash deposit rate in the U.S. is 0.43% and the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.24% as of Nov. 19. If income is your primary investing goal, there are better options than Nvidia. Learn more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide Nvidia's stock price is high relative to its historic sales and earnings. Investors buying Nvidia today largely believe the company's future earnings will justify the current price tag. This is a common rationale for growth stocks, but it comes with risk. Stocks that trade at high prices relative to earnings can be volatile. The stock price moves higher on investor optimism but may fall quickly if earnings fail to meet future expectations. If you prefer a safer approach, you could wait until Nvidia's price dips before you buy. As long as the decline is related to investor sentiment or a temporary circumstance, it should not affect the company's long-term potential. The optimistic outlook for Nvidia relies on continued AI infrastructure spending. Multiple researchers and analysts believe the AI technology buildout still has years of growth ahead. However, research and advisory firm Forrester notes that "only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024," despite billions spent on AI infrastructure in 2023. AI implementations must deliver returns, or the trajectory of spending on data center infrastructure will change. A spending decline could challenge Nvidia's efforts to meet investor expectations. The Department of Commerce has proposed new rules limiting the export of high-powered semiconductors and related technologies. The rules are intended to prevent foreign adversaries from developing technology that could threaten national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. is enforcing its existing export restrictions. In November 2024, the Department of Commerce ordered Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), a major supplier to Nvidia, to stop shipping high-powered chips to Chinese customers. Existing and new semiconductor export restrictions limit Nvidia's opportunity in China, which is a sizable market. Statista estimates the Chinese chip sales totaled $185 billion in 2023. If you intend to invest in Nvidia, plan on following these regulatory developments and evaluating their ongoing impact on the business. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Nvidia competitor, is also targeting the AI chip market. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has raised the company's R&D budget dramatically and made a string of acquisitions to broaden AMD's AI resources and expertise. AMD does not have a meaningful market share in AI chips today, but the company says its newest chip, the MI325X, is more powerful than Nvidia's H200. As a prospective Nvidia investor, you might consider analyzing a competitor like AMD to understand its capabilities and how they could affect Nvidia's prospects. Nvidia also faces competition from the major cloud computing providers: Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). These tech giants, currently among Nvidia's largest customers, are developing their own AI chips to avoid being overly dependent on Nvidia. It is always smart to define your sell parameters before buying any stock, especially the volatile ones. Sell triggers can be positive developments that push the stock price higher and create profit-taking opportunities. Or, triggers can be negative circumstances that permanently dampen the company's outlook. Having documented sell triggers can discourage you from making an emotionally driven decision to liquidate. With Nvidia's history of price declines and recoveries, a rash decision to sell could leave you watching from the sidelines as the stock returns to growth. Only you can decide if the risks associated with Nvidia stock are worth the rewards. Learn the business, know your risk tolerance, and choose a position size that makes sense.

Title: Nvidia Says Its Blackwell Chip Is Fine, Nothing to See Here
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-earnings-blackwell-chips-overheating/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T00:15:14Z
Full Content:
Chip giant Nvidia reported its third-quarter earnings earlier today, and all ears—and presumably some watch parties—were tuned in to try to determine what the company’s performance might mean for the near future of the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. The fate of the company’s newest AI chip, Blackwell, was a major focus after production issues caused shipments to be delayed for several months earlier this year. On Sunday, The Information also reported that Blackwell chips were overheating when connected together in Nvidia’s customized server racks, prompting the company to make design changes. But Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts and investors on its earnings call today that Blackwell production now “is in full steam.” “We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated,” Huang said. Some of Nvidia’s most important customers, like Microsoft and OpenAI, have already received the new chips, and Blackwell sales could end up generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company next quarter, executives said. Some industry analysts reported earlier that problems with the new chips had been fixed. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at the research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business insider that the Blackwell overheating issues “have been present for months and have largely been addressed.” Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy, told WIRED that his manufacturing contacts were unaware of any major overheating issues. But it's not unusual, he said, for there to be tension between design, engineering, and production when bringing a new chip design to market. “It’s a debate as old as semiconductors: Is it a design issue? Is it a production issue?” Moorhead said. “People are going to look for any type of smoke that can get in the way of the thesis of [Nvidia’s] dramatic growth.” Nvidia generated $35.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating estimates of $33.2 billion. Its revenue rose 94 percent compared to last year. That’s a relatively small increase compared to a few of its recent quarters, when revenue rose as much as 265 percent on an annual basis—but Nvidia isn’t going out of business anytime soon. The results indicate that the AI market is continuing to boom as companies pour billions of dollars into buying advanced chips and other equipment, albeit at a slightly slower pace. A large portion of Nvidia’s growth this quarter was driven by data center revenue, totaling $30.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 112 percent from last year. The company’s gross profit margin was 74.5 percent, essentially flat from a year ago. But analysts expect that Nvidia’s margins could shrink as the company shifts to producing more Blackwell chips, which cost more to make than their less advanced predecessors. Nvidia’s earnings reports are seen as an important bellwether for the AI industry. The chip architect’s advanced GPUs, which power complex neural network processing, are what made the current generative AI boom possible. As Silicon Valley giants raced to build new chatbots and image-generation tools over the past few years, Nvidia’s revenue exploded, allowing it to surpass Apple as the most valuable public company in the world. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, Nvidia’s stock price has increased nearly tenfold. Almost every major tech company working on AI, even those building their own processing units, rely heavily on Nvidia GPUs to train their AI models. Meta, for example, has said that it is building its latest AI technology on a cluster of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100s. Smaller AI startups, meanwhile, have been left without enough AI compute power as Nvidia struggled to keep up with demand. Blackwell, Nvidia’s newest GPU, is made up of two pieces of silicon each equivalent to the size of its previous chip, Hopper, which are combined together into a single component. This design has resulted in a chip that’s supposedly four times faster and with more than double the number of transistors as its predecessor. But the launch of Blackwell hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Originally slated to ship in the second quarter, the new chip hit a production snag, reportedly delaying the rollout by a few months. Huang took responsibility for the problem, calling it a “design flaw” that “caused the yield to be low.” Huang told Reuters in August that Nvidia’s longtime chipmaking partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, helped Nvidia correct the issue. Moorhead told WIRED he remains bullish on Nvidia and is confident that the generative AI market will continue to grow for at least the next 12 to 18 months, despite some recent reports suggesting AI progress is starting to plateau. “I think the only way shareholders would have a mutiny is if they were concerned about the capital expenditures or the profitability of the hyperscalers,” Moorhead said, referring to big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta that are heavily invested in AI cloud services. “But I think they’re just going to keep buying up Nvidia until that day actually comes.” Enterprise AI is still an area of growth for Nvidia as well, he added. On today’s earnings call, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said Nvidia’s enterprise AI tools are in “full throttle,” including an operating platform that lets other businesses build their own copilots and AI agents. Customers include Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow, she said. Huang echoed the same thing later in the call: “We’re starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI,” he said. “It’s really the latest rage.”

Despite the strong performance, shares dipped more than 2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor caution over valuation and tempered guidance. The chipmaker posted revenue of $35.08 billion for the quarter ended October 27, a 94% increase year-on-year and beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $33.28 billion. Nvidia’s non-GAAP earnings-per-share came in at $0.81, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.75 EPS. Revenue from the Data Center segment, Nvidia’s key growth driver, reached a record $30.8 billion, up 112% from the same period last year. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, called the quarter a reflection of “AI in full steam” as enterprises adopt Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs and anticipate the launch of its next-generation Blackwell platform. The tech giant has been riding high this year following an explosion of investor interest in AI-related firms and businesses. That has helped drive the Nasdaq to record heights amid prospects of a return to cheaper borrowing should the U.S. Federal Reserve continue to slash its benchmark rate. Despite strong results, Nvidia’s stock fell 0.76% during regular trading and dropped another 2.39% in after-hours, closing at $142.40. Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking after Nvidia's year-long rally, along with cautious reactions to the company’s Q4 guidance. Nvidia expects revenue of $37.5 billion for the next quarter, representing a 7% sequential increase and aligning with analyst forecasts. Nvidia’s gaming segment also saw steady growth, reporting $3.3 billion in revenue, up 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. However, smaller segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization, while growing, contributed modestly to overall revenue.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) fiscal third quarter revenues beat Wall Street’s expectations for another straight quarter at a record $35.1 billion — up 94% from a year ago. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October are up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. Nvidia reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” Nvidia was expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.34%). Net income was expected to be $17.4 billion and EPS was expected at $0.75. Shares of the chipmaker were down 0.76% at the market close on Wednesday. Nvidia’s shares are up 202.86% so far this year. The company’s data center quarterly revenue was $30.8 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter, and up 112% year over year. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company was expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet estimates. “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia would have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz ahead of earnings. On an earnings call with analysts, the company said that it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell samples in the fiscal third quarter, and that the artificial intelligence platform is in full production. In response to an analyst’s questions about reports of Blackwell overheating and Nvidia’s roadmap to produce AI chips on a one year cycle, Huang said that the company plans to deliver more Blackwells in the current quarter than previously estimated, and that “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” “We’re expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map,” Huang said. “Everything is on track as far as I know. Nvidia’s shares were down 3.47% during after-hours trading on Wednesday after it released its earnings results. The shares remained down by 1.2% later in the evening. The chipmaker’s shares fell 6.9% in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal second quarter earnings in August. Nvidia had set fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above the average analysts were expecting, but below top end estimates.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steep losses Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers, has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the prices of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group, Kostin said, could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said, "We've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued, "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season.

US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

Target posted its biggest earnings miss in two years and cut its forecast. The company spoke about a "deceleration in discretionary demand" and blamed higher costs caused by the rush to move inventory ahead of the short-lived port strike in October. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Cornell described U.S. consumers who are "shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation" and holding out for the best possible deal. Walmart, on the other hand, hiked its full-year forecast. It said it's gaining upper-income shoppers and seeing better trends for sales of merchandise outside of the grocery department, even as consumers look for value. Customer traffic gains were similar at the two stores, yet Walmart's sales trends looked much better than Target's. Walmart's traffic growth edged out its rival's, with a gain of 3.1% at Walmart U.S. versus 2.4% at Target. Walmart's same-store sales rose 5.3%, while Target's increased only 0.3% year over year. Walmart's e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 22%, a bigger increase than the nearly 11% at Target. The sharp differences between the two big-box retailers — and how their businesses are executing in the same economic backdrop — illustrate where consumers are willing to spend money and where they are pulling back as they remain selective about spending. That sharp divergence of the winners and losers in the industry could become even starker as retailers enter their most crucial sales season of the year. Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Target's disappointing results reflect the company's performance rather than the health of consumers. "It's as simple as this: They are losing share," Baker said. "They are losing share to Walmart, Amazon and Costco." He said Target's inconsistent results over the past year are a warning sign about execution. The company has missed Wall Street's quarterly sales and earnings expectations in two quarters and beat on them in two other quarters. "That kind of back and forth makes you wonder if there's something going on internally," he said. Several equity research analysts, including Citi Research, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Global Research, downgraded Target's stock Wednesday, citing concerns that the Minneapolis-based retailer has lost shoppers and sales to competitors. Its stock dropped more than 20% in trading Wednesday. In a research note, Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst for Citi, said the company's poor results and weak outlook show Target is "likely losing share" to Walmart and risks losing more of the market unless it steps up promotions. One of the roots of Target's troubles is the company's merchandise mix, said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs. About 60% of Target's sales come from discretionary items, such as home goods and clothing. That's the opposite of Walmart, which draws about 60% of its sales from everyday necessities, such as groceries and household items such as paper towels. Those discretionary categories, which customers sometimes splurge or pull back on, explain "some of the volatility and the bumpiness you are seeing that is more specific to Target," she said. Both Walmart and Target mentioned the negative impact of the port strike, but Target appeared to put a major share of the blame for its weak quarter on the stoppage. D.A. Davidson's Baker said weak sales can "make those kinds of cost increases stand out more." Target has other questions that will factor into its future, including who will lead the company. Cornell, who has been chief executive since 2014, agreed in September 2022 to stay on as the company's leader for three more years. On a call with investors Wednesday, Cornell pointed to "green shoots" in the business, even as sales results disappointed. He spoke about customer traffic growth, online sales gains and relative strength in apparel sales, even as unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers from buying clothes for cooler temperatures. Yet on that same call, several analysts posed questions about Target's plans for the future. UBS equity research analyst Michael Lasser asked if Target needs to make changes or invest more in its business. Cornell said the company will stick with what it already does: offering unique items and national brands, opening new stores, expanding its advertising business and offering more ways for shoppers to buy online. "We'll continue on our current strategy, stay in step with the consumer and make sure Target's doing the things that consumers across America expect from us," he said. Got a confidential news tip?

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO). What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry. Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations. Don’t Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook. Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes. By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company. Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so. If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline. Check It Out: Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

Title: Weight loss drug makers want more insurance plans to cover Wegovy and Zepbound
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-zepbound-insurance-coverage-1851703905
Time Published: 2024-11-20T16:14:00Z

Weight-loss drug makers are directly targeting employers in a campaign to expand health insurance coverage of their popular, but pricey, medications. The Wall Street Journal reports that reps for both Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.39%), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.30%), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro, are visiting labor unions and HR teams across the country to make the case for anti-obesity drugs. These treatments belong to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. The drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Morgan Stanley (MS-0.24%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030, but that will hinge on patient access. However, insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the specific use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have been reluctant to cover these treatments due to their steep costs, which can significantly inflate employers’ healthcare budgets and drive up premiums across the board. Without insurance, Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. Only about 65 million, or 25%, of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight-loss drugs, according to data from consulting firm Leverage. The firm’s AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus database tracks the insurance coverage of weight-loss treatments of roughly 80% of Americans. The majority of GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage comes from state Medicaid plans. Leverage estimates that Medicaid plans, which are government programs for low-income families, provide weight-loss drug coverage for 31.6 million people. Medicare only covers these treatments if they are prescribed to treat a second condition in addition to weight loss. When it comes to private or employer-sponsored plans, these only provide GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage for 13.7 million people, according to the database. But because many employers don’t make the details of their plans public, Leverage estimates this number could be up to 24.4 million people. A recent survey revealed that only around 44% of U.S. employers with 500 or more employees offered coverage for weight-loss drugs in 2024. In response, drugmakers are emphasizing that addressing obesity and its related complications could lead to significant long-term savings in healthcare costs for employers. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been testing these medications to uncover any additional health benefits they might provide. This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes. Eli Lilly is also seeking approval for Zepbound to treat sleep apnea. Additionally, numerous studies suggest these medications may help with a range of conditions — from treating addictions and Alzheimer’s disease to reducing the risk of COVID-19-related deaths.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Eli Lilly (LLY) and Hong Kong-listed Laekna (2105.HK) will collaborate to develop an experimental obesity drug that aims to help patients lose weight while preserving muscle, the biotech said on Wednesday. Why it matters Lilly is aiming to strengthen its position as a leader in the obesity treatment market, which is expected to hit $150 billion in revenue by the next decade. Last year, the company spent about $2 billion to acquire Versanis' drug that acts directly on fat cells, without prompting lean mass loss. Several other drugmakers including Regeneron and Scholar Rock are testing treatments that could help preserve muscle, which is often lost when patients lose weight through lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery or the use of GLP-1 treatments such as Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk (NVO)'s Wegovy. Context The collaboration will accelerate the development of Laekna's experimental drug, LAE102, which belongs to a class of drugs that play a key role in muscle regeneration as well as the breakdown and storage of fat for energy. Lilly will fund the development of the drug and share its resources and expertise, but Laekna will retain the global rights for the drug and plans to advance the early-stage trial of the drug in China. Laekna said the drug has shown to increase lean mass and decrease fat mass in lab studies. In combination with a GLP-1 treatment, it could further reduce fat mass and help patients significantly regain the lean mass lost during weight loss.

Title: Weight loss drug makers still have huge upside, and the market overreacted to RFK Jr. named to top health role, BMO says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/weight-loss-drugs-stocks-rfk-trump-health-hhs-secretary-ozempic-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-20T14:41:12Z

Shares of pharmaceutical companies that produce popular weight loss drugs have tumbled since president-elect Donald Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, but analysts at BMO Capital Markets said this week that the selloff is overdone. Since Kennedy's nomination last Thursday, stocks like Wegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Zepbound maker Eli Lilly have lost 3% and 7%, respectively. Other weight loss drug stocks like Amgen and Structure Therapeutics, meanwhile, have fallen 5% and 13%. The selloffs "reflect more fear than real fundamental downside risk," the analysts argued in a note. They say Kennedy's role as the top health leader in the US comes with limited ability to actually change policy that would impact the pricing and availability of the drugs. As a result, there is likely little risk to the shares of companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. "The head of HHS is typically a more administrative position," the analysts said. Kennedy has previously pledged to fight obesity with nutrition instead of GLP-1 drugs. In an interview with Fox News last month, he pointed to a bill that would make Ozempic available to overweight Americans, which would cost $3 trillion per year, he said. He suggested those funds would be better used for other initiatives. "If we spend about one-fifth of that giving good food, three meals a day to every man, woman, and child in our country, we can solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight for a tiny fraction of the cost," he said. In reality, though, the health secretary has limited actual authority to influence either GLP-1 drug pricing or the passage of future bills like the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which expands Medicare coverage to cover weight loss drugs, the BMO analysts said. If a public health emergency was declared, the secretary could adjust Medicare reimbursement for some "Part B" drugs, but weight loss drugs fall under "Part D," the analysts say. "While RFK Jr. appears less optimistic on the use of incretins to curb the obesity crisis, he remains limited in his ability to influence either policy or pricing of obesity medications," the analysts said. As a result, weight loss drugs still have massive potential, the analysts said, pointing to Novo Nordisk's recent Wegovy launch in China, which has a largely untapped potential market of around 180 million obese adults. "Importantly, China's national healthcare will not cover Wegovy, and upcoming patent expiration may limit long-term sales in the geography, but we continue to highlight the significant size of patient population and prevalence of cash payment in China may be a tailwind that benefits Novo going forward," the analysts say. The analysts maintain their $156 price target for Novo Nordisk stock, implying 52% upside from current levels, as well as a price target of $1010 for Eli Lilly, a potential 38% rise. Kennedy's nomination also sparked a sell-off in health stocks more broadly, particularly among vaccine makers like Moderna, Pfizer, and GSK, as well as a range of European healthcare stocks with exposure to the US market. Kennedy has been a vocal skeptic of vaccines, once calling those that protect against COVID-19 a "crime against humanity." The sector's losses stand out from much of the rest of the market, which has rallied on the hopes that Trump's deregulatory policies and corporate tax cuts will boost profitability.

MIT professor Max Tegmark and Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson discuss what AI policy might look like under the next Trump Administration at the 2024 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Camille Tuutti Stay Connected By Camille Tuutti A second Trump administration could reshape U.S. and global tech industries, with deregulation, artificial intelligence safety and Elon Musk’s growing influence at the forefront. These potential shifts were discussed at Lisbon’s Web Summit during the Nov. 12 session “A New Trump Era,” moderated by NPR CEO Katherine Maher. “Pod Save the People” host DeRay Mckesson and “West Wing” actor Richard Schiff explored how Trump’s second presidency might impact the tech world. Schiff began the session by comparing tech’s growing influence to that of the oil industry, highlighting its ability to drive policy and accumulate wealth. “I think Elon Musk has already doubled his wealth since last Tuesday,” he said. “And tech to me . . . might very likely be the new oil in that it's going to affect policy because the money is there and the power is there.” Schiff said he doubted the Trump administration would regulate tech or address monopolies, a stance he said benefits the industry but raises equity concerns. “The most important tech person in the world has now become the shadow vice president and, if not more, so I think the tech industry is going to get whatever they want,” he said, referring to Musk. “Are we going to stop monopolies? Probably not. Are we going to regulate? Probably not. Maybe that's great for tech, I don't know. I don't know how good it is for the world, the country.” Mckesson turned the conversation to Musk’s leadership, criticizing his tenure at X for making the platform more ideological, despite Musk’s claims to oppose such tendencies. He compared Musk’s polarizing approach to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s growing reputation as a more moderate leader. “[Zuckerberg] was a villain for so long in Silicon Valley,” Mckesson said. “Now, he's sort of the sane person left standing, it seems. So it'll be interesting to see what he does with WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook — these places that are in the ecosystem that is not Twitter.” Maher then shifted the discussion to AI, asking whether a stronger AI sector could bolster national security. Schiff offered a cultural perspective, suggesting that tough times often ignite creativity. “The silver lining, for me, might be that in authoritarian societies, the best art comes out of the more compressed artists feel, the more expression they end up having,” he said. “There's that darkness that there's light somewhere.” Musk’s role in the Trump administration At a Nov. 13 panel titled “Did Elon Musk Destroy Twitter?” panelists examined Musk’s leadership style and its implications as the proposed head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Kate Conger, a New York Times tech reporter, argued Musk’s drastic cost-cutting measures at X could serve as a blueprint for how he might address federal bureaucracy. “Musk's campaign to downsize Twitter is really a model for what he wants to do for the federal government, and in a lot of ways, it's empowered him to pursue this role,” she said. She pointed to Musk’s perceived success in maintaining X operations after massive layoffs that gutted 75% of the workforce. “Despite some small outages, it still has continued to run, and so he must feel very empowered by that and feels that he can make these deep cuts to the government and bureaucracy,” she said Ryan Mac, another New York Times tech reporter, brought up Musk’s potential conflicts of interest leading DOGE. Tesla and SpaceX, both of which rely on federal contracts, are under at least 20 federal investigations, according to NYT reporting, he said. As DOGE head, Musk could wield significant influence over the agencies regulating his companies, Mac added. “If there is a situation at the [Federal Aviation Administration], which oversees Tesla and SpaceX, could [Musk] have his finger on the scale to change what the FAA does?” Mac asked. “We just don't know. I think that potential is pretty scary.” AI policy and power concentration Trump has suggested rolling back President Joe Biden's 2023 executive order on AI, a move that could shutter the U.S. AI Safety Institute. Part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the institute addresses risks to national security, public safety and individual rights. During the panel “Is AI the Answer or the Problem?” Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson explored whether Musk’s outspoken concerns about AI risks might influence Trump to adopt stricter AI policies instead of loosening regulations to compete with China. She asked MIT professor Max Tegmark if Musk’s views could shape Trump’s approach to AI governance. “I hope so,” Tegmark said, stressing the need to educate leaders about AI’s dangers. “You don't actually need to persuade them that they shouldn't want to be replaced by and dominated by some new weird machine species. They are already against that. It's just a matter of education.” Tegmark expressed optimism that Musk could help Trump grasp the national security risks posed by uncontrolled AI and the economic importance of building safe, manageable AI. “I'm definitely hoping that Elon can help Donald Trump understand that this is just not in America's national security interests that American companies build something that we lose control over in two years, and that the real path to prosperity in America and even strength is to build AI tools that can be controlled,” he said. Olson also highlighted the growing concentration of AI power, pointing out how companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google are snapping up smaller startups. Tegmark identified two major risks: the dominance of a few companies and humanity losing control over powerful AI systems. Despite these concerns, Tegmark ended on a hopeful note, highlighting AI’s potential to solve global challenges if developed responsibly. “With AI, there's so many things we would love to do but just haven't figured out how to do — prevent our loved ones from dying of diseases and safeguard our climate and so on and so forth,” he said. “And if we can get this right with tool AI, we can have a more amazing future than we ever dreamt of.” This year’s Web Summit attracted over 71,500 attendees from around the globe, according to a LinkedIn post by the event's organizers, including industry leaders, policymakers and innovators.

In a November 19 Twitter Space discussion hosted by Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck, the Bitcoin maximalist announced that he has agreed to deliver a concise, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s leadership. The pitch comes amidst a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to assess Bitcoin’s potential impact on its balance sheet. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a 3-minute presentation,” Saylor said. “That’s all you’re allowed—and I’m going to present it to the board of directors” A staunch advocate of Bitcoin, Saylor criticized corporations with large cash reserves for “burning shareholder value,” during yesterday's the Twitter space discussion. In his view, Bitcoin can bring great stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky stock if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he stated. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 252,220 BTC valued at $16.8 billion, believes Bitcoin is a necessary asset for companies with large cash reserves. He shared during the discussion that his earlier request for a private meeting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to discuss the topic has not yet been accepted. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 In October, Saylor directly addressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Twitter, saying, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment on Dec. 10. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) introduced the proposal last month, citing MicroStrategy’s success with Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed Microsoft’s by 313% this year, even though the company operates at a much smaller scale. “MicroStrategy, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, it holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet,” noted NCPPR in the proposal. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal. Microsoft maintains that it already evaluates a broad range of investment options, including Bitcoin. The company’s share price traded relatively modest on Wednesday, increasing 0.49% to $417.79, Google Finance data shows. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies. All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers. Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well. To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight. Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year. Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026. As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power. The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively. While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components. While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year. Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period. Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year. The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67. In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions. Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand. Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2. I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood. Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters. As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge. For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations). This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4. It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again. This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%. On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026: Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints. The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month. TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity. By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023. Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars. For a limited time, get up to $250 off with one of our biggest sales of the year starting Nov 28th. Sign up for our newsletter for more information on the upcoming sale or Follow me on xAI/Twitter.

Title: Pulling in top talent: The work perks that really matter
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/11/20/the-work-perks-that-really-matter/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T06:00:00Z

From performance bonuses to babysitting, Deliveroo vouchers to doggy day care, employee benefits packages have got a whole lot more interesting. Big employers use headline-grabbing benefits to position themselves as desirable and to attract top talent. From carpooling to counselling, grocery delivery to co-working hub vouchers, some companies are even offering free babysitting to make sure knackered staff get out on date night. But which perks are worth the most, and how do you make sure you are getting everything available? In addition to salary, good benefits increase an employer’s chance of beating others to the best staff. Some benefits are arguably aimed at a specific demographic only, leaving other applicants cold. This may be a strategy. Would you be persuaded by seemingly generous doggy day-care vouchers and Just Eat delivery? These benefits signal that new hires can expect to be time-poor, unable to commit to mealtimes at home, or to responsibilities outside of work. They are likely to be aimed at attracting those for whom the office can be dominant in their lives — they won’t require being away from it much. If that’s where you are at, then these perks can pay off in the short term. A dog sitter in Dublin city for example is about €25 a day, or about €4,500 a year for someone in the office four days a week. Those travelling for business can expect to pay €35 for overnight dog sitting. If you’re offered food delivery credits as a perk, know that how you use them may be restricted. In October, staff at Meta in the US were fired for eating the meal at home instead of the office. Meta, like many big tech companies, offers free food to employees based out of its Silicon Valley headquarters. Staff in smaller offices without a canteen are offered Uber Eats or Grubhub credits, for example, for food to be delivered to the office. They are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and $25 for dinner. Employees who were getting the meals sent home when they were required to only eat the food in the office were fired. Some perks leave a bad taste. Less than one per cent of employers offer anything by way of childcare vouchers, says Trayc Keevans of Morgan McKinley survey. What’s the benefit the employees in Ireland most care about? No, it’s not doggy day care that’s really keeping us awake at night, but rather how to pay for our lives once we retire. Pension tops the list of the most desired benefits, according to a survey of 3,400 professionals and 650 employers globally as part of a 2024 report by recruiter Morgan McKinley. “We are seeing employees younger than ever before actually looking at pension,” says Trayc Keevans, Morgan McKinley Ireland’s global foreign direct investment director. “It wasn’t as important before, but in the most recent survey, right across the board, pension was an important benefit,” says Keevans. By 2046, Irish men can expect to live to 85 and women to 89. So if you retire at the current State pension age of 66, you’ll have about 20 years of living after your last pay cheque. [ Has Fingal County Council found a solution to Ireland’s housing crisis?Opens in new window ] If you start to save for retirement at age 30, on a salary of €40,000, you will need to set aside a minimum of 18 per cent of gross salary every year until age 66 to get an income of €2,000 a month in today’s money – and that’s including the State pension, according to Pensions Authority calculations. With parenthood and home ownership happening later than ever, the cost of supporting children and paying a mortgage is now stretching past retirement age. Housing costs mean more people will be renting in retirement too. This is bringing employer pension contributions into sharp focus for employees. Don’t just ask a prospective employer if there’s a pension, ask about the terms, says Keevan. Some are only finding out when it comes to contract signing that the terms are less generous than their current employer. Know the contribution from your current employer at least get that matched, says Keevans. Smaller companies will usually pay pension contributions of between 3 and 6 per cent, matching your contribution, she says. “Standard in a midsize to multinational company would be from 5 per cent matching up to manager level,” says Keevans. “Above that, a company might make contributions of anything up to 10 or 12 per cent. The larger multinationals will go even higher,” she says. “The best pension I have seen was a 19 per cent employer contribution, with the employee being asked to make a contribution of 4 per cent, bringing it up to 23 per cent.” Ask if pension entitlements increase as you climb the ranks. Employer pension contributions nudge up when you reach a certain age in some companies. Knowing this can help inform your job hunting. Paid private health insurance is the second most valued employee benefit, according to the Morgan McKinley research. A separate survey of 1,000 adults by Dooley Insurance Group puts health insurance top of the heap with 56 per cent of employees prioritising it. More than three in 10 of us didn’t go to a healthcare appointment because we could not afford it, according to an Irish Cancer Society survey last month [November]. One in four, meanwhile, felt we must prioritise other costs over healthcare. With the average adult paying €1,685 a year for health insurance, according to the Health Insurance Authority figures, this is a valuable perk for your health and your pocket. “We find at manager level and above, the policy covers the spouse and dependents as well,” says Keevans. Families with two adults and two children can pay up to €5,000 a year for insurance cover. You’ll need to earn about €10,000 to pay for that out of after-tax income. The cost isn’t the only benefit with paid health insurance, but rather access to basic treatment in a reasonable time frame. Almost two-fifths of people put off a medical appointment due to pressures in the system, according to the Irish Cancer Society survey. Working from home takes the third spot as the most valued employee benefit, says Morgan McKinley survey. Remote working was also highly rated by participants in the Dooley Insurances survey, with 35 per cent placing significant value on it. Remote working saves on transport and clothing costs. Coupled with flexible working, it may even enable some households to save on before and after-school care. This can mean significant savings. Only about a fifth of those eligible are claiming the remote work tax credit, according to Revenue figures. The credit for a year averages about €40 to €60, so there’s no boon here. The real pay-off is work-life balance, and job candidates are negotiating hard on this. “If they take a holiday in Spain every year, they might ask to tag on another few weeks and work from there, if that’s permissible,” says Keevans. “They are asking for a ‘work from anywhere’ policy in their contract that would allow them to do that. That’s quite attractive and we’ve seen a lot of people negotiate that.” Companies are still grappling with how many weeks an employee can work out of the country, before triggering tax liabilities there, she says. “Companies are tending to be quite conservative in guesstimating what that will be, the most we have seen is six weeks, but we see a lot of reluctance to it.” Flexibility around working patterns remains a prominent request. “Somebody might be joining a company where the standard is three days a week in the office, but it’s moving to four days. They might negotiate to move it back to three, but that can be difficult in the current climate,” says Keevans. New hires could negotiate an initial period of office time to get to build relationships and understand the culture, with that being reviewed, she says. Who doesn’t love a bonus? If this is part of the package, it’s important to understand what’s on offer. “Is it tied to your personal contribution and meeting personal performance metrics such as sales quotas, project milestones, performance reviews or KPIs? [key performance indicators]” says Keevans. “We see some employers and if the company isn’t performing, there’s no bonus for anyone and if it is performing, then the individual performance piece is cleared for payment,” she says. “The better you perform, the better chance you have of a bonus, but again, it tends to be predicated on the company performing first.” Exceptions to retain top talent can be made, rewarding them even when the company isn’t performing, she says. If a new employer needs you to join pronto, but that means missing out on the bonus at your old job, then negotiate on this. “They may pay you a sign-on bonus to offset what you are losing,” says Keevans. Shares can be great, but only if you know what to do with them. “In most cases, it’s a share purchase scheme that is offered. This is where you can buy shares in the company through salary sacrifice or bonus, usually at a discounted rate,” says David Looney or Alpha Wealth. Typically if these shares are held for three years, you don’t have to pay tax on the benefit, so the only tax due will be capital gains on any increase in their value if sold. Sometimes senior staff are offered stock options or restricted share units. Stock options are where you are allowed to buy a specific amount of shares at a fixed price in the future. If the share price is more than that price at the time you buy, happy days. Options usually have an expiration date, so a perk like this requires ongoing review to assess if it makes sense to buy at a particular time. Share prices can go up and down of course, and things can change quickly. You may benefit from independent financial advice. “We meet clients with little in their pensions, large mortgages and car loans, little in other savings and investments, and then have hundreds of thousands worth of Google stock that they are too afraid to sell,” says David Looney. “You can benefit from tax-free gains of €1,270 a year if selling, previous capital losses can be offset against gains too, but I would encourage anyone with a large amount of shares, six figures, to ignore this and put risk management above tax efficiency,” he says. Selling company stock and investing the proceeds in a more diversified way means all your eggs aren’t in your employer’s basket. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor to present Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.
