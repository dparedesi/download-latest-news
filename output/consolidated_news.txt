Reviews ethics statement These Alexa commands are built to help you take control of your life, one task at a time. Your day gets easier when you know which Alexa commands to use. Alexa may have been originally introduced as a voice assistant to help you with reminders or adjusting your music, but over the last 11 years it's come a long way. Now Alexa is getting a new upgrade. Alexa Plus delivers new AI-powered tools to become smarter, more conversational, and for the first time, more proactive than ever. It can control your smart devices, keep your calendar organized even if it changes, manage your Fire TV and even move from one speaker to another when you change rooms. Alexa is now integrated in a way that makes it easier to use. If you've been ignoring Alexa for a while, now is a great time to check out new commands and see if they can keep up with your busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response.

Title: Donald Trump's Mass Deportation Agenda Has A Surprising Stakeholder: Bill Gates

Log in to hide these messages. Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk Senior Reporter President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda has a surprising stakeholder: Bill Gates. The multibillionaire tech mogul and philanthropist owns a large portion of a key service provider for immigration flights. And now, with new funding from Congress and an aggressive push from the White House, more and more immigration flights are taking off, transporting immigration detainees both within the United States and to their home countries — or, in some cases, to places they’ve never been before. Gates’ connection to the U.S. detention and deportation machine is a company called Signature Aviation. Signature calls itself “the world’s largest network of private aviation terminals,” and it’s a linchpin in the day-to-day machinery of Trump’s immigration enforcement apparatus. For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. Support our mission to keep us around for the next 20 — we can’t do this without you. Private charter carriers subcontracted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to transport immigration detainees — part of a network known as “ICE Air,” a reference to the Department of Homeland Security’s ICE Air Operations — use Signature’s services daily. As a fixed-base operator, or FBO, Signature supplies ground crews, aviation fuel, boarding stairs, and airplane hangar space at hundreds of airports around the world, mostly in the United States. The private firm that holds Gates’ and the Gates Foundation Trust’s assets, Cascade Investment, increased its stake in the company to 30% in 2021, when it and two partners bought Signature outright for $4.7 billion. Human rights advocates — plane trackers and activists who keep tabs on deportation flights, as well as the aviation and logistics companies profiting from them — say Gates’ stake in Signature is at odds with his humanitarian work, including the Gates Foundation’s support of a plethora of immigration-focused nonprofits. Without FBOs like Signature, they say, Trump’s mass deportation agenda would be stuck on the ground. Gates himself has not publicly commented on Signature Aviation’s crucial role in servicing ICE Air flights. Neither the Gates Foundation nor Cascade Asset Management Company, which oversees Cascade Investment, responded to multiple requests for comment. At one airport, Signature appears to have worked to make its branding less visibly associated with immigration flights. Last month, a set of Signature boarding stairs in Seattle — where the county government set up cameras in 2023 to keep an eye on immigration flights — got a new accessory: two sheets of cardboard, taped over the company’s logos. FBOs “are critical, obviously, because they provide fuel and other services while the plane makes its stops,” said Tom Cartwright, a retired financial executive who has tracked ICE flights for nearly six years. Cartwright estimated that through the end of June, 95% of the ICE Air flights he’d tracked were operated by charter companies, with military and Coast Guard planes being used for the remainder. That doesn’t include a tally of commercial flights used to deport people, he said — but in fiscal year 2017, ICE Air used charter flights to remove or transfer 181,317 people, compared with just 8,288 who were removed on commercial flights, according to a 2019 DHS inspector general report. “In this case, when they’re doing 1,100 flights a month, that’s a pretty significant piece of the operation — so they’re absolutely critical,” he said of the planes carrying immigration detainees. “Without a fixed-base operator, I’m not sure this system really operates.” In a recent report covering local connections to alleged human rights violations stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR), which has studied ICE Air flights for years, called out Gates’ Signature Aviation investment specifically. “In Washington, our most famous philanthropist grows his investments in part by supporting a company complicit in gross human rights abuses, potentially ascending to the level of crimes against humanity,” the report alleged. To report this story, HuffPost scoured government records and plane location data, collected plane-spotting reports from activists on the ground, and matched aviation photographs to planes known to ferry ICE detainees. Still, ICE Air operates largely in the shadows, and many key players, including Signature Aviation, did not answer detailed questions about their operations. So we wanted to see the process for ourselves. On Aug. 31, HuffPost witnessed Signature Aviation in action. On the tarmac of Newark Liberty International Airport, a couple hundred yards from Signature’s private terminal, a Signature-branded set of boarding stairs and fuel tanker met a Boeing 737 belonging to Avelo Airlines, the low-cost carrier that has faced protests and a boycott from potential passengers over its work with ICE Air. Like other Avelo planes working ICE Air flights, this plane, with the tail number N801XT, was recently painted completely white, erasing any prominent Avelo branding. One by one, 16 people dressed in white and gray, and shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, hobbled off the plane and onto Signature Aviation’s boarding stairs, unable to reach the handrail on the stairs. On the tarmac, the second man in line shuffled his feet slightly, taking uneven steps as his head drooped, making him look older than the rest. The plane had just finished a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Alexandria, Louisiana, a central hub for ICE Air flights, meaning the men had likely been shackled for several hours straight. The detainees waited on the tarmac as they were processed into sprinter vans with flashing police lights. A Signature-branded fuel tanker sidled up to the plane, and personnel on the ground hauled plastic mesh bags known to be used for detainees’ personal belongings. Eventually, accompanied by Port Authority police vehicles, the caravan left the tarmac, likely heading to nearby ICE detention facilities. Two weeks prior, HuffPost saw a similar scene play out, when a plane operated by Eastern Air Express — the same aircraft CNN recently spotted ferrying people in ICE custody — was met with similar fanfare at Newark. Law enforcement vehicles with flashing lights approached that plane as well, including one that looked similar to a shuttle bus previously filmed transporting detainees out of Delaney Hall, the infamous immigration jail. In both cases, after about an hour on the ground, the planes continued on their way around the country, ferrying people in ICE custody to other detention facilities, and for some, onto their ultimate deportation, according to one activist plane spotter who goes by the moniker “JJ in DC” on Bluesky and who helped HuffPost track the aircraft. “In Washington, our most famous philanthropist grows his investments in part by supporting a company complicit in gross human rights abuses, potentially ascending to the level of crimes against humanity.” Such scenes are now commonplace throughout the country. But they are not new. For over a decade, private aviation contractors have handled tens of thousands of ICE Air flights, according to Cartwright’s count, which can collectively transfer or remove hundreds of thousands of people annually. Recent video from King County’s cameras at Boeing Field-King County International Airport in Seattle shows a grim parade of detainees. One climbs a set of boarding stairs while shackled and holding a cane. Another, also shackled — detainees generally are, including during flights — is manhandled by several guards who run him onto the plane; a few feet before Signature’s staircase, the group stumbles and the man falls onto the tarmac. “The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights is a standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.” “ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” the statement added. “ICE Air Operations flights are law enforcement sensitive. ICE conducts flights throughout the U.S. on a daily basis. For operational security purposes, ICE does not discuss ongoing or future operations.” Activists working to end ICE Air’s presence in Seattle have zeroed in on Signature’s work as a service provider for charter flights. “The presence of Signature is essential for ICE to be within the airport, because without having a fixed-base operator to service the planes, they can’t land there, and no one else is doing this type of work,” said Guadalupe Gonzalez, flight monitoring coordinator for La Resistencia, an immigrant-led activist group in Washington state that seeks to end immigrant detention and deportation. “Signature Aviation specifically are the ones responsible for servicing ICE at Boeing Field.” Gonzalez said La Resistencia volunteers, who observe ICE Air transfers in person at Boeing Field, have in recent years reported seeing detainees bound in the “WRAP” restraint system, a type of full-body restraint device that has come under scrutiny in the past. More commonly, Gonzalez said, people with mobility issues were made to walk up Signature’s stairs to a waiting ICE Air flight. Not having a presence at Boeing Field, Gonzalez said, “would impair [ICE’s] efforts to deport as many people as possible — or, at the very minimum, make it more costly.” Signature Aviation did not answer a lengthy list of questions about its practices, including its involvement with ICE Air. Instead, the company sent a one-sentence statement. “Our FBOs must accept flight operations that comply with the law, FAA regulations and contract requirements at federally funded airports,” said Rosanna Fiske, the company’s global head of corporate affairs. Fiske did not respond to follow-up questions about the nature of Signature’s obligations, including the terms of contracts it may have signed with ICE Air charter operators. Gates is a significant shareholder in Signature Aviation. Cascade Investment LLC, the holding company for Gates’ and the Gates Foundation’s assets, first bought a piece of the company’s predecessor, BBA Aviation, in 2009. In 2021, a bidding war broke out over the company, and Gates’ Cascade — then Signature’s largest individual shareholder, with a 19% stake — joined forces with Blackstone Group and Global Infrastructure Partners to buy it outright. (Global Infrastructure Partners was acquired by BlackRock in 2024.) Working together, the three firms bought Signature for $4.7 billion, with Cascade winding up with 30% of the company. Cascade Investment LLC is overseen by Cascade Asset Management Company. That firm’s chief investment officer is Michael Larson, who has Gates’ “complete trust and faith,” Gates said in 2014, at a party he threw celebrating the 20th anniversary of Larson managing his assets. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that their arrangement was “simple: Mr. Larson makes money, and Mr. Gates gives it away.” Cascade Investment is located in the same Kirkland, Washington, office park as Gates’ personal office, The New York Times noted in a 2021 story. Cascade’s mandate, one unnamed former employee told the Times for the same story, was: “We don’t want Bill’s name in the headlines.” Cascade’s work on Gates’ behalf has come up in the news before. For example, when The Land Report revealed in 2021 that Gates was “America’s largest private farmland owner,” what they were really talking about, as NBC News later described it, was farmland “purchased through a constellation of companies that all link back to [Bill and Melinda Gates’] investment group, Cascade Investments, based in Kirkland, Washington.” When Gates was asked about his farmland purchases, which made national news, he said, “My investment group chose to do this” and “all these decisions are made by a professional investment team.” The same might apply to Signature Aviation. It’s unclear how much Gates knows about his stake in the company, or whether he knows that Signature plays such a crucial role in Trump’s mass deportation operation. Still, “it would be surprising if Gates couldn’t influence a decision to disinvest of this particular investment,” said Cartwright, who before his retirement spent decades at J.P. Morgan, including as chief financial officer of one division that covered 5,000 bank branches. The foundation has previously addressed concerns about its money being invested in Signature Aviation. One complaint recently filed through EthicsPoint, a public-facing portal to submit ethical concerns to the foundation, and later shared with HuffPost, accused the foundation of “providing material support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement” through its investment in Signature. In response, the foundation said it did not “control or participate in the activities of the Gates Foundation Trust.” Instead, the foundation said, the trust’s assets were “independently managed by Cascade Asset Management Company.” Look closely and you’ll see Signature Aviation popping up across Trump’s mass deportation pipeline. In fact, the company is part of perhaps the most infamous footage of Trump’s second term so far: an “ASMR” video that glorifies shackling and transporting immigration detainees. The video was filmed at Boeing Field, where the number of contracted ICE flights, all serviced by Signature Aviation, has shot up this year. It also happens to be a 20-minute drive from the Gates Foundation’s offices. Signature’s distinct logo is visible at the top of a set of boarding stairs about five seconds into the clip: ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight 🔊 pic.twitter.com/O6L1iYt9b4 Signature did not answer HuffPost’s inquiry about where it serviced ICE Air flights, but the company has had a significant footprint in servicing aviation contractors hired by ICE. In 2019, one internal ICE document listed Signature as the designated FBO for contracted ICE flights at 12 major domestic airports: Atlanta, Dallas, Newark, Houston, Laredo, Kansas City, Memphis, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Chicago, San Diego, San Antonio, and Denver, where HuffPost recently spotted a set of Signature boarding stairs pulled up to another all-white Avelo Air plane. And while it’s not clear whether ICE Air still uses every airport on the 2019 list, the list also doesn’t include airports where Signature has recently been spotted servicing ICE Air flights. For example, the 2019 document doesn’t include Seattle’s Boeing Field. Signature now frequently services ICE flights there, and detainees picked up at the airport have ended up in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, Guantánamo Bay, and South Sudan, according to the recent report from UWCHR. The human rights center previously obtained the 2019 list of airports that listed FBOs servicing the ICE flights pursuant to a public records request to ICE. Signature also appears to be servicing immigration flights out of Jacksonville, Florida. One March email with the subject line “ICE Schedule This Week” notes several charter flights landing at Jacksonville International Airport. The activist group Ground ICE — which aims to “limit the rate at which I.C.E. can transport and remove its detainees” — obtained the document through a public records request and shared it with HuffPost. Recipients of the email included Signature Aviation’s Jacksonville manager as well as several email accounts associated with GEO Group, a private prison contractor. In July, Fox 13 News Utah captured video of apparent immigration detainees climbing a set of Signature boarding stairs at Salt Lake City International Airport. And Rolling Stone recently spotted a Coast Guard plane refueling and boarding ICE detainees at Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Independent journalist Gillian Brockell, who wrote the Rolling Stone story, told HuffPost that Signature Aviation refueled the plane. Signature is also the only FBO at Buffalo Niagara International Airport, Ground ICE has noted. Planes carrying immigration detainees pass through that airport once or twice a week, according to Cartwright, who is currently transitioning his work over to the group Human Rights First. Various entities involved with Gates’ ICE Air investment proclaim their commitment to human rights. Signature Aviation itself says it is committed to “refraining from coercion and never deliberately causing harm to anyone” and that it takes steps “to confirm that our businesses and supply chains are free from modern slavery and human trafficking.” Another company policy requires that suppliers “never use, support, or engage in forced or indentured labor, or practices involving coercion, deception, or abuse of power — including human trafficking, slavery and child labor.” As part of its efforts to combat human trafficking, it says it works with the Department of Homeland Security. (ICE falls under the purview of DHS.) Cascade says it takes “a value-oriented approach” to investing money for Gates and the Gates Foundation Trust, and that one of its objectives is to “protect Bill and the Trust by acting lawfully, honestly, ethically, and with integrity, safeguarding their assets and information.” It notes that “neither Cascade nor the Trust play a role in the grantmaking or operations of the foundation” and that the foundation “does not control or participate in the Trust’s investment activities.” The Gates Foundation says its mission is to “create a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life,” and the foundation has awarded grants to multiple prominent immigration-focused nonprofits. The experiences of immigration detainees traveling on ICE Air — particularly ICE’s use of shackles, which bind their wrists and ankles — seemingly stand in contrast to those commitments. The shackles “felt very disrespectful, dehumanizing to a lot of degrees,” Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist jailed and threatened with deportation for his beliefs, recalled to Zeteo after his release from ICE custody in June. After more than a day of travel, “by the time I arrived in Jena, [Louisiana, home to an infamous ICE jail,] I couldn’t walk because my leg was swollen from the shackles,” Khalil added. Deportation flight passengers have alleged “the use of racist epithets and insults, and rough physical treatment upon boarding,” as well as, in more isolated cases, “beatings, the use of straitjackets, verbal abuse and threats, and the denial of access to restrooms,” according to a UWCHR summary of public records it received detailing the complaints. In one case, a Somalia-bound deportation flight sat on a tarmac in Senegal for a full day due to technical issues, while detainees remained shackled inside and the plane’s toilets “overfilled with human waste,” according to a subsequent lawsuit. The plane eventually returned all of the detainees to the United States. (The suit was ultimately dismissed for jurisdictional reasons, and many of the people on the ill-fated flight continued to face deportation proceedings.) Relying on private contractors at every stage of the deportation process creates major vulnerabilities for ICE — which may be why the Trump administration is reportedly considering purchasing its own fleet of deportation planes. While giant private prison companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group are dependent on federal contracts to survive, FBOs work in different economic conditions. Most rely on business from corporate and private jet travel, and they’re often subject to local political pressure. For example, Ground ICE has encouraged pilots to write to Signature Aviation and “let them know you will not be buying fuel from them” due to their work for ICE. More than anywhere else, Seattle’s Boeing Field represents how local anti-deportation sentiment can affect FBOs and seriously slow down ICE’s work. In 2019, amid pressure from local activist groups and an impactful report from UWCHR concerning “King County Collaboration with ICE Air Deportation Flights at Boeing Field,” then-King County executive Dow Constantine ordered, among other things, that future leases at Boeing Field contain a prohibition against the private transport of immigration detainees. The FBO for those flights at the time, Modern Aviation, stopped servicing them soon after that executive order, even though the order was ultimately blocked in court. Two other FBOs at the airport, including Signature, also said they “will not take over from Modern in servicing ICE flights,” The Seattle Times reported at the time, citing the airport’s director. (Matt Dill, general manager at Modern Aviation’s location at Boeing Field, declined to comment.) “Without the help of such companies,” the paper reported, “flights cannot operate at the airport. Though they can technically take off and land, [airport director John] Parrott said, flights need a company to open gates, to provide stairs to get passengers on and off planes, and to offer fuel.” Without an FBO in Seattle, ICE was forced to route planes through Yakima — where the airport was smaller, more remote, and hours inland. In a court filing, the Trump administration said it only landed on the remote airport after approaching three others “without success.” The Trump administration also acknowledged at the time that this shift jammed the gears of its deportation machinery, particularly when it came to people detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. “Transporting detainees from Tacoma to Yakima, as compared to Tacoma to Boeing Field, adds, at a minimum, six hours of travel time to the process of executing an ICE Air flight,” the filing read. “Additionally,” it continued, “the transport to Yakima and back frequently requires the use of an additional bus and two additional officers, as well as additional meal and fuel costs. This takes resources away from federal law enforcement tasks that would otherwise be performed if the ICE Air flights were flying out of Boeing Field. Relocation of the ICE Air flights to Yakima also impacts ICE operations in Yakima, requiring ICE to utilize staffing of at least two officers from its Yakima sub-office to facilitate the flight processing in Yakima. Additionally, travel over the mountain passes in winter is hazardous, and frequently either slowed significantly by road conditions or suspended altogether, as was the case on January 14, 2020, when an ICE Air flight had to be cancelled due to road conditions prohibiting transport.” On March 30, 2023, a federal judge ruled against the county’s executive order requiring future FBO leases to prohibit work on deportation flights. “At that time, Signature Aviation said, ‘OK, we’ll do that business,’” recalled Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, the director of UWCHR. “Ever since then, the ICE flights have resumed at Boeing Field, and they’re being served by Signature Aviation.” Local public radio station KNKX described Signature at the time as “the fixed-base operator that agreed to service ICE flights at Boeing Field.” By May 2, four years after ICE Air flights stopped at Boeing Field, they resumed again, according to records of the flights kept by the county. Signature has been their sole service provider ever since, according to the same records. “Without a fixed-base operator, I’m not sure this system really operates.” For Godoy, the years-long absence of deportation flights running through Seattle shows just how important FBOs like Signature Aviation are. “Here in Seattle, what we saw in 2019 and to this date, was that when there was enough local concern, and people expressing local outrage about it, that the other FBOs also didn’t want to do it,” she said. “There are businesses who will say, ‘No, we don’t want this, we don’t want to be associated with this.’” Local pressure also may have recently disrupted ICE Air operations on the other side of the country. Last month, after media attention and local protest over the spike in immigration flights from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts — including specific attention on Signature Aviation for servicing the flights — the ICE Air flights to that airport stopped, instead going through Portsmouth International Airport at Pease in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Signature does not have a presence. “It was because the activists were so annoying, basically, to that airfield, and they were so focused on Signature, that they decided to shift to [Portsmouth International Airport] as the hub for New England,” JJ in DC posited to HuffPost, referring to the shift from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. Godoy also speculated that the shift came in response to protest. “My impression is that, for Signature, the ICE flights are only a portion of their business, and not the majority of their business — and when the ICE flights become sufficiently notorious, that threatens Signature’s overall business, and then they say ‘no thanks,’” she said. “And it looks to me — this is speculation, because I’m not privy to the discussions between ICE and Signature — like that’s what happened at Hanscom Field,” Godoy added. “So now, ICE is going to be using a more far-away airport, which is more inconvenient for them. And they haven’t said why.” Still, even apparent route changes may not last: Two flights from Avelo Airlines planes landed at Hanscom Field on Friday and Saturday, flight records show. The airline, ICE, and Signature Aviation did not respond to questions about the purpose of the flights. The financial backing behind Signature Aviation doesn’t stop with Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation. Annual financial reports reviewed by HuffPost show several large public pension funds are also stakeholders in Signature. Institutional investors Blackstone and BlackRock (via Global Infrastructure Partners) own the remainder of the company that Gates does not. And those massive asset management firms often invest money in various funds on behalf of public pensions, nonprofits and university endowments. One such fund, a BlackRock product called Global Infrastructure Partners Fund IV, has 68 such limited partners, according to data from PitchBook, a private-equity market database. That includes the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a public pension that in 2023 held more than $350 million of the fund; the New York State Common Retirement Fund; the Utah State University endowment; the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System; the Washington State Investment Board; and more than 60 others. BlackRock and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System declined to comment. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, Oregon Investment Council (which manages OPERS’ investments) and the Utah State University endowment didn’t respond. A spokesperson for WSIB told HuffPost that, as a policy, it does not comment on individual holdings. Washington’s stake was flagged by UWCHR, which warned in its recent report that “public workers’ retirements are being financed in part through investments in organizations that profit from the detention and deportation of our neighbors.” A handful of public pension funds are also invested in a similar offering from Blackstone, called Blackstone Infrastructure Partners. They include the New Mexico State Investment Council, the Orange County Employees’ Retirement System, Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, according to the PitchBook data. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment, nor did the New Mexico State Investment Council. A spokesperson for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas declined to comment, citing a Texas law that prohibits discussing specific investments. The Orange County Employees’ Retirement System and Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System similarly declined to comment. Azani Creeks, a senior campaign and research coordinator at PESP, a nonprofit watchdog organization focused on the private equity industry, told HuffPost that people whose pensions rely on these investments are entitled to have a say in their composition. “You can contact pension fund staff and trustees by email to schedule a meeting, and often, pension funds have regular meetings with public comment periods in which you can communicate your concerns,” Creeks said. “A handful of private equity firms, drawing on capital from pension funds, foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and other institutional investors, exert major influence through investments in companies providing services to immigrant detention facilities and migrant shelters around the United States.” JJ in DC noted that in his work tracking immigration flights, he’s been struck by just how opaque the process is. The Department of Homeland Security contracts with its main broker, CSI Aviation, which works with a network of subcontractors including GlobalX, Avelo and Eastern Air Express. Those firms in turn work with FBOs like Signature Aviation. Along the way, airplanes have been made harder to spot — with some losing all of their external branding or being taken off public flight trackers, though their information is still available on crowdsourced networks like ADS-B Exchange. (Anyone with the correct receiver can contribute to the site, which presents location information broadcast by individual aircraft over radio waves as an interactive and real-time, though not always complete, map of global aviation traffic.) The result, in the end, are taxpayer dollars quietly contributing to the portfolios of people like Gates and the Gates Foundation Trust. “This is a big pressure point,” JJ in DC told HuffPost. “And if more people apply pressure, it’s going to hurt their operations, and they’re going to have to adjust.” Matt Shuham reported from New York.

Title: Broadcom vs. Nvidia: Not a zero-sum game

UPDATED 12:08 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are locked in a zero-sum battle for artificial intelligence data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. Nvidia has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the internet. In this Breaking Analysis, we examine the different strategies of Broadcom and Nvidia and explain why the success of one doesn’t necessarily mean dilution to the others’ prospects. Nvidia’s strategy is straightforward in concept but extraordinarily difficult to replicate. The company builds a full-stack platform that starts with graphics processing units and extends across the system. Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that the unit of competition is no longer the chip, but the system or what Nvidia coined as the AI factory. Nvidia has positioned itself as the indispensable supplier for anyone looking to stand up these factories. At the core of Nvidia’s stack are GPUs such as Hopper and Blackwell, paired with NVLink/NVSwitch interconnects to form tightly coupled compute domains. These “pods” scale to 72 GPUs, creating high-bandwidth, low-latency islands optimized for extreme parallel processing workloads such as AI training. Nvidia extends these pods outward using InfiniBand, a proprietary network technology it captured from its Mellanox acquisition. In addition, Nvidia leverages its Spectrum-X Ethernet, a purpose-built Ethernet fabric designed to handle AI traffic deterministically. On top of the hardware sits its CUDA software stack and hundreds of libraries that represent the software glue that makes these systems programmable and highly tuned. Nvidia’s software moat is deep, with tens of thousands of developers locked into its ecosystem and wide supporting a virtually infinite number of use cases. In addition, the company offers systems and services such as DGX, NIMS inference microservices and Omniverse for simulation and digital twins, further solidifying its position as a platform, not just a chip supplier. The cadence of innovation is relentless. Each year, Nvidia launches new architectures that deliver better performance per watt and higher utilization of the cluster. This annual rhythm turns capital spending into a recurring monetization cycle. The result, when power is a constraint and systems are underutilized, is that customers spend more, generate more tokens per watt, and reduce unit cost at scale. Broadcom’s approach is significantly different from that of Nvidia. Chief Executive Hock Tan and Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, are not chasing GPUs or building giant AI systems. Instead, Broadcom’s playbook is to identify durable franchises – markets with a decade or more of runway – establish technology leadership, and run them with intense operating discipline. Some investors have shied away from Broadcom citing it as a “commodity player.” In our view, this narrative is misguided and lacks an understanding of the engineering investments required to deliver the products Broadcom produces, including in its wireless portfolio. In semiconductors, Broadcom has staked its claim in connectivity. Its Tomahawk and Jericho families dominate merchant Ethernet switching. It has also secured custom silicon design wins with Google, Meta and likely ByteDance, embedding Broadcom deep into the hyperscale AI buildout. These are multibillion-dollar, long-duration deals that are highly strategic. The company just announced it closed another $10 billion custom chip deal, widely known to be with OpenAI, which, like the hyperscalers, is designing its own chips to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. On the last earnings call, Tan had what appeared to be an inadvertent and ironic “tell” saying the following: Today’s AI rack scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabit per second bandwidth using proprietary NVLink. On the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched Tomahawk 5 with OpenAI — with open Ethernet, sorry, which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. This slip of the tongue came right after he announced the most recent $10 billion custom chip deal, leading many observers, including us, to conclude that OpenAI was clearly embedded (in a good way) in Tan’s head space. Charlie Kawwas’ mantra is “OSP.” It stands for open, scalable, power-efficient and frames Broadcom’s philosophy. The company bets that open standards such as Ethernet and PCIe will ultimately win out over proprietary approaches such as InfiniBand and NVLink. History suggests this is a good bet, which is why Nvidia has also embraced Ethernet. In software, Broadcom has reshaped VMware around VMware Cloud Foundation, announcing VCF 9.0 claiming the integration of all those disparate VMware software modules was achieved with thousands of engineers creating the bundle. Broadcom’s strategy to force customers into higher-value contracts, though controversial, has driven operating margins above 70% and gross margins over 90%, substantially better than other software-as-a-service gross margins. Moreover, VMware has become the most robust on-premises alternative to public cloud and represents the most mature private cloud offering on the market, in our view. The quirk of Broadcom’s VMware strategy is that alternatives such as Hyper-V, Nutanix, Red Hat and others have gained momentum, where previously they were shut out as virtualization plays. Broadcom doesn’t want the customers unwilling to pay up for the full VCF stack, but alternative players that don’t have nearly the profitability profile of Broadcom are happy to take the business. The graphic below shows Enterprise Technology Research’s Net Score methodology for the virtualization market. The vertical axis (Net Score) represents the net percentage of customers spending more on each platform and the horizontal axis shows penetration into the data set. The data would lead one to believe that VMware is struggling, noting its precipitous drop from January 2023. But the methodology doesn’t capture amount of spend. As such, it misses the fact that Broadcom’s strategy has been to focus its efforts more narrowly on those high value customers willing to spend on the whole VCF bundle to lower total cost of ownership. This is a classic Broadcom move. It only competes in markets where it can dominate. In the case of VMware, it’s not the number of logos that matters, rather its the number of customers that willing to absorb price increases and buy the full bundle. Contrary to many misguided narratives, Broadcom invests heavily in engineering and surrounds its platform with critical technologies that drive clear return on investment. This is why (for example) even Nvidia buys networking technologies from Broadcom. The bottom line is that Broadcom doesn’t need to win in GPUs head-to-head with Nvidia to thrive. Instead, it supplies the glue — SerDes, NICs, optics and switches — that make large AI systems possible. In Kawwas’ words, Broadcom doesn’t make GPUs, it makes the stuff that makes XPUs and HBMs work. In addition, it has secured multibillion-dollar, long-duration contracts to build custom AI chips for some of the top companies in the world, including Google, Meta, ByteDance and now OpenAI. A major flashpoint between the two companies is the question of scale. On Broadcom’s most recent earnings call, Tan depositioned Nvidia’s NVLink 72 as “scaling up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabits per second,” contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet fabrics that can connect 512 nodes using Tomahawk 5. At face value, this makes Nvidia’s approach sound limited. But the comparison is misleading in our view. The way we interpret Nvidia’s use of the “scale up, out, across” terminology is as follows: Broadcom, in Tan’s remark, appears to have used “scale up” more loosely to mean “supporting larger clusters than 72 GPUs.” But technically, connecting 512 compute nodes with Ethernet is a scale-out fabric, not scale-up. In particular, scale-up is generally thought of as making a single logical system bigger by tightly coupling components. Think symmetric multiprocessing in a single box. In our view, Tan was depositioning NVLink’s rack-level island (72 GPUs) as small, contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet-based ability to connect hundreds of nodes. In doing so, he takes liberty with the terminology, calling Ethernet’s cluster expansion “scale up,” when in fact in classic parlance it’s scale-out. In contrast, Nvidia’s 72 GPUs refers to a tightly coupled NVLink domain where high-bandwidth memory pools are shared across GPUs, enabling highly efficient parallel operations. Broadcom’s 512 nodes really refers to the scale-out capability of Ethernet fabrics. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The two approaches solve different problems. NVLink maximizes performance within a rack, while Ethernet extends clusters across racks and rows. The tradeoff is that NVLink delivers peak performance per GPU, Ethernet delivers estate-level scalability and economics. In practice, operators use both – NVLink for high-performance compute islands, Ethernet for stitching those islands together. The financial models of Nvidia and Broadcom underscore their different strategies. On the surface, both companies post extraordinary results, but the way they get there is different. Nvidia today is running at a revenue pace of roughly $187 billion annually, up an impressive 56% year-over-year. Despite moderating from the triple-digit growth rates of prior quarters, this remains one of the fastest growth profiles of any mega-cap. Margins are equally impressive: 73% gross, 65% operating and 33% operating cash flow. With a market capitalization north of $4 trillion and a 22x run rate revenue multiple, Nvidia is being valued as a once-in-a-generation growth company, not a traditional semiconductor provider. In our view, this reflects investor conviction that Nvidia’s full-stack AI factory strategy has years of runway left, with annual cadence upgrades, CUDA software lock-in and hyperscaler demand elasticity sustaining momentum. And an economic value proposition that is compelling when power is the limiting factor and utilization/efficiency improvements can be achieved with rapid tech refreshes. In its recent earnings call, Nvidia stressed the ramp of Blackwell, with NVLink 72 deployments showing 10x efficiency gains on reasoning workloads compared with Hopper. Management highlighted that inference is now a meaningful revenue stream, alongside training. In terms of ROI, elasticity (Jevons paradox) is allowing Nvidia to cut price per token while still growing revenue. Broadcom, by contrast, is delivering exceptional results with a different playbook. The company is operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $64 billion, growing a solid but more measured 22% year-over-year. This past quarter its non-AI semiconductor offerings were a headwind, but they’re expected to grow sequentially. Broadcom’s gross margin of 67% is lower than Nvidia’s, but Broadcom shines in cash generation, with 45% operating cash flow margin – a remarkable figure given the scale of the business. Operating margin sits at 37%, well below Nvidia’s, but consistent with Broadcom’s blend of semiconductors and infrastructure software. Its valuation, at roughly $1.6 trillion market cap and a 25x revenue multiple, is notable. Investors are waking up to Broadcom, not for its hypergrowth, but for its durability, discipline and strategic positioning as the connective tissue for AI infrastructure, the go-to firm for custom AI chips and the value creator of its VMware asset. Broadcom’s recent earnings highlighted Tomahawk 5’s ability to scale clusters well beyond the NVLink pod size. We note the caveats to Tan’s statements, as cited earlier. Tan reiterated that VMware Cloud Foundation adoption is ahead of schedule, with software margins approaching 70%. AI silicon revenue run-rate hit ~$16 billion, anchored by custom hyperscaler wins and an exciting $10 billion deal widely reported to be with OpenAI. In our opinion, these financial metrics underscore Nvidia as a hypergrowth platform company trading at a premium for its velocity, while Broadcom is a durable compounder valued for its consistency, cash flows and long-term franchises. Both models are exceptional, both companies are fundamental to the AI movement, but they reflect entirely different philosophies of how to capture value in the AI era. We believe the implications of these strategies are meaningful in the sense that: In our opinion, the market should stop framing Broadcom and Nvidia as rivals in a zero-sum contest. Moreover, the idea that Broadcom is a commodity play, as posited by some pundits, is absurd in our view. Nvidia and Broadcom are playing different games, both of which are essential to the AI era. Nvidia builds the compute engines and software platforms that drive new workloads. Broadcom ensures those engines can scale, interconnect and operate profitably over a decade-long horizon. Our research suggests that as AI moves from cloud to enterprise to real-world systems, both Nvidia and Broadcom will expand their moats in very different, but highly synergistic ways. The real battle is not between them, but between this new architecture and the legacy compute stack it is replacing.

The exchange, which lists Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech giants, would give customers the option of trading securities via traditional digital representation of ownership with or without blockchain backing. "A participant that wishes for its order to clear and settle in tokenized form shall notate its preference upon entry of the order in the system by selecting a flag that the exchange designates for this purpose, in accordance with the exchange’s procedures," Nasdaq said in its filing. "When a participant enters an order with the tokenization flag selected, the exchange will communicate the participant’s clearance and settlement instruction to The Depository Trust Company." Nasdaq's proposal adds to the fervor for tokenization among both traditional finance and digital asset-focused firms. In June, Robinhood rolled out trading for European users of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds as tokens on Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. In May, crypto exchange Kraken announced its own tokenization plans through a partnership with Backed, using the Solana blockchain. The offering would cover more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. "Over time, U.S. equity markets have thrived while absorbing successive waves of technological innovations," Nasdaq said in its filing, adding: "The existing regulatory structure mandated by Congress applies to tokenized securities, regardless of whether such securities have certain unique properties (like the ability to be settled on a blockchain), much like it did when the SEC allowed securities to be decimalized and electronified and when exchange traded funds and other novel securities were approved decades ago." "The exchange believes the markets can use tokenization while continuing to provide the benefits and protections of the national market system," it added. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. In its second quarter conference call in July, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev referenced tokenization nearly a dozen times. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” during the call.

Title: Meet the bidders vying to build Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/paxos-frax-agora-and-native-markets-compete-to-build-usdh-stablecoin/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T15:28:05Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link Bidders vying to build Hyperliquid’s stablecoin are swarming the protocol. So far, six organisations have posted proposals on the protocol’s Discord server after Hyperliquid announced it will launch a stablecoin on Friday, a move that will reduce its dependency on external issuers. The plan is to let the validators who run the network decide who will get the privilege of purchasing the right to launch the stablecoin, which will trade under the ticker USDH. Hyperliquid is the biggest perpetual futures exchange in DeFi. It handled a whopping $378 billion in trading volume over the past month, per DefiLlama data. However, it currently denotes its spot markets using Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT stablecoins, the two biggest stablecoins on the market. Hyperliquid’s USDH will compete with USDC and USDT on the protocol, reducing its dependency on third-party stablecoins, and potentially capturing additional revenue. Validators will be able to vote on their preferred proposal after Hyperliquid’s next network upgrade, a date for which has yet to be announced. Here are the four proposals gaining the most traction among the Hyperliquid community. The biggest firm to submit a proposal so far is Paxos, the New York-based fintech behind several stablecoins, including PayPal USD and Global Dollar. It proposes using 95% of the interest earned on USDH’s reserve assets, like short-dated treasury bonds, to fund buybacks of the HYPE token. The firm plans to back USDH with US Treasury Bills, repurchase agreements, and its Global Dollar stablecoin. Paxos has a track record of contributing to multiple Hyperliquid ecosystem projects, including LHYPE, a tokenised leveraged loop trade, and WHLP, a tokenised representation of Hyperliquid’s HLP vault. Community feedback to Paxos’ proposal has been largely positive. Frax Finance, the issuer of the Frax Dollar stablecoin, is the biggest DeFi protocol to join the fray. It wants to issue USDH natively on Hyperliquid against its frxUSD stablecoin, giving holders the ability to mint and redeem the tokens across frxUSD, USDC, USDT, and US dollars. Frax hasn’t given any concrete plans on what it would do with the interest earned on reserve assets, but said it could be used to boost HYPE staking yield, conduct buybacks of the HYPE token, or used for rebates to active traders or rewards for USDH holders. Community feedback has been mostly positive, however some have questioned whether Frax is as aligned with Hyperliquid as the other organisations submitting proposals. Agora styles itself as a white-label stablecoin issuer, using its AUSD stablecoin to back other dollar-pegged assets. The firm said it plans to share 100% of net revenue from USDH’s reserve assets to fund buybacks of the HYPE token. Reserves for an Agora-issued USDH will be administered by State Street and VanEck, the same firms that Agora uses for its AUSD reserves. Agora also said it could potentially bring USDH to new users by working with consumer-facing apps like EtherFi. Feedback has been positive, but some have questioned what Agora’s incentive to issue and manage a USDH is if it plans to send all revenue minus custodian fees to Hyperliquid. Native Markets is a new organisation put together specifically to compete for the right to issue USDH. It is led by Max Fiege, a Hyperliquid ecosystem investor and advisor. Native Markets said it will back USDH with offchain reserves initially managed by BlackRock and onchain reserves managed by Superstate through stablecoin platform Bridge, which is owned by Stripe. The group proposes using 50% of the interest earned on reserve assets to buy back the HYPE token, with the other 50% set aside to fund USDH growth. Several governance participants have warned that Native Markets relying on Bridge for stablecoin issuance could present a single point of failure.

Title: Nasdaq files for regulatory nod to introduce tokenized stocks and ETFs

Nasdaq aims to integrate tokenized stocks, focusing on improving efficiency without compromising investor protection. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq is seeking regulatory approval to introduce tokenized versions of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto its existing trading platform. On Sept. 8, Tal Cohen, Nasdaq’s president, outlined the vision in a LinkedIn statement, explaining that the plan is designed to capture the efficiency gains of tokenization while preserving investor rights and market safeguards built over decades. This initiative reflects a wider shift across traditional finance where asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity are experimenting with tokenized offerings. Due to this growing adoption, Galaxy Research has estimated that tokenized equities could represent a $190 trillion market within two decades. Nasdaq, one of the largest traditional stock exchanges with a daily trading volume of more than $400 billion, stressed that US equities already rank as the world’s most liquid and transparent markets, supported by rigorous oversight and advanced technology. Cohen explained that the proposal would extend those strengths into the digital era rather than replace them. According to him: Join The Crypto Investor Blueprint — 5 days of pro-level strategies to turbocharge your portfolio. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via “The approach will ensure tokenized securities trade as regular securities, safeguarding both investors’ rights and the systemic stability of our markets through tested, resilient infrastructure. It seeks to capture the benefits of the technology while ensuring it matures in a way that best serves investors, issuers, and other stakeholders across global capital markets.” He pointed out that the Nasdaq’s filing highlighted how tokenization could streamline long-standing market processes. According to him, the technology could introduce faster settlement cycles, lower transaction friction, and programmable corporate actions into the system. Still, Cohen cautioned that such changes must not come at the expense of resilience or security. He highlighted decentralized finance as a lesson in both potential and risk of integrating blockchain technology into the space. According to him, DeFi platforms have demonstrated new ways of handling trading and clearing, but have also exposed vulnerabilities when growth outpaces governance. Considering this, Cohen stressed that investor protection and operational stability must remain at the core as new technologies are introduced. As a result, the exchange said it is ready to collaborate with infrastructure providers to explore applications such as modernized proxy voting and automated post-trade services.

Sky News has learnt that Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive who has presided over the stratospheric rise in its valuation to more than $4trn, is expected to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles during the trip.

The attendance of figures such as Mr Huang and, potentially, Mr Altman, will fuel expectations that a wave of corporate deals and investments in the UK will be unveiled during Mr Trump's unprecedented second state visit.

Title: Wall Street Sees U.S. Entry as Catalyst for Bullish’s Next Leg Up
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/08/wall-street-sees-u-s-entry-as-catalyst-for-bullish-s-next-leg-up
Time Published: 2025-09-08T14:12:17Z

Crypto platform Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, received a number of stock ratings from Wall Street analysts on Monday, as brokerage firms initiated coverage of the stock after its recent IPO. Rosenblatt Securities started coverage with a buy rating and a $60 price target, citing shifting U.S. political winds and rising institutional adoption as key catalysts for growth, the broker said in a research report Monday. The firm argues that Bullish, one of the largest regulated institutional exchanges, is well positioned to capitalize on what it calls a “dramatic improvement” in the U.S. political environment for digital assets. Despite not yet serving U.S. clients, Bullish has already handled more than $500 billion in annual trading volume, a scale Rosenblatt views as evidence of demand. The upcoming U.S. launch is expected to be a major catalyst, the broker noted, while the passage of the GENIUS Act has opened a new opportunity in stablecoins. Rosenblatt believes stablecoin-related revenue could provide recurring income less exposed to trading volatility. Stablecoin values are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets providing, among other things, a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. The sector has a market cap of about $280 billion, CoinGecko data show, and is dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's USDC. Bullish’s ownership of media properties and potential expansion into retail trading add further upside, according to the note. On that basis, Rosenblatt values the stock at 31x projected 2027 adjusted EBITDA, underpinning its $60 target. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity has also initiated coverage of Bullish with a buy rating and a $68 price target, highlighting the exchange’s growing institutional traction and potential boost from a pending New York BitLicense. Founded in 2020, Bullish has quickly become a major player in crypto trading, recently leading global regulated exchanges in spot trading volumes for bitcoin BTC$111,170.75, ether (ETH), and stablecoins, the report said. The company has expanded beyond trading with the acquisitions of CoinDesk in 2023 and CCData in 2024, adding media, data, and information services to its business lines. Canaccord analysts also note Bullish’s role in the emerging “stablecoin wars,” supporting issuers like PayPal (PYPL) and Société Générale (GLE) with listings, liquidity, and promotion. Already licensed in Europe and Asia, Bullish is expected to secure a BitLicense soon, opening access to U.S. institutional clients, the analysts wrote. Despite conservative assumptions in its forecasts, including flat bitcoin prices through 2027, Canaccord points to Bullish’s early profitability, balance sheet bolstered by $2.4 billion in bitcoin, and long-term growth prospects as reasons for optimism. Meanwhile, broker Bernstein has initiated coverage of Bullish with a market-perform rating and a $60 price target, highlighting the exchange’s experienced management team and its ambition to become the second-largest institutional platform after Coinbase. That outcome, the firm says, hinges on a successful U.S. launch in 2026, where Coinbase currently dominates but opportunities are emerging around stablecoins, market data and indices. Bullish’s ownership of CoinDesk also offers potential optionality if it moves into retail exchange services. "We expect Bullish to capture ~8% market share in U.S spot institutional crypto volumes by 2027E, while global spot market share remains at ~7%," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) has also initiated coverage of Bullish, assigning the crypto exchange operator a neutral rating and a price target of $50. Like Bernstein, the JPMorgan analyst also pointed to Bullish’s experienced management team and its ability to navigate the fast-evolving digital asset landscape. The bank's analyst said growth will likely be fueled by rising institutional demand for crypto exposure and the increasing role of tokens and stablecoins in trading activity. Bullish is also well-positioned to expand into the U.S. market, building on its existing foothold in Europe and Asia. According to the bank, another growth driver will be its Liquidity Services business, where clearer regulation could broaden the range of supported blockchains and tokens, creating a stronger environment for exchanges like Bullish. Still, JPMorgan noted that the firm’s current scale remains limited relative to its market opportunity. With the company at what the bank called a “critical point of maturity,” analysts said valuation concerns justify staying on the sidelines for now. The shares were trading 3.6% lower, around $50.53, at publication time.

Share this article CoinShares, Europe’s leading digital asset manager with approximately $10 billion in assets under management, announced today it will go public on the Nasdaq Stock Market through a $1.2 billion business combination with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp. The company is the world’s fourth-largest digital asset ETP manager after BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, and leads Europe with 34% market share. CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said the Nasdaq listing reflects the company’s push for international growth and leadership. The transaction positions CoinShares as one of the largest publicly traded pure-play digital asset managers globally. “It signals a strategic transition for CoinShares, accelerating our ambition for global leadership, supported by favorable regulatory tailwinds,” said Mognetti in a statement. CoinShares has more than tripled its assets under management over the past two years through new investor inflows, supportive digital asset pricing, and product launches. “CoinShares exemplifies everything we look for in a high-value investment: market leadership, a proven, scalable business model, a massive and expanding addressable market, and a team with the proven ability to execute,” said Nicholas Petruska, CEO of Vine Hill. The transaction includes a $50 million equity investment commitment from an institutional investor. The deal is slated to wrap up by year-end, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.

Title: S&P 500 Weekly Winners: How AI Powered The Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/08/sp-500-weekly-winners-how-ai-powered-the-surge/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T13:28:50Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. During the week ending September 5, the S&P 500 was essentially unchanged, slipping 0.12%. In contrast, several S&P 500 constituents—particularly AI-related names—posted strong gains. The week’s top movers were propelled by upbeat quarterly surprises, sizable chip agreements, and constructive regulatory developments. Macroeconomic data pointed to a softer labor market: nonfarm payrolls in August rose by only 22,000, well below the 75,000 forecast, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%. Together, these readings reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will move forward with a widely anticipated interest rate cut later this month. We detail the biggest movers below. That said, if you’re seeking upside with less volatility than a single-stock position, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outpaced its blended benchmark—the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see – S&P 500 Losers: From Lululemon To MGM — What Went Wrong? Western Digital’s stock climbed 15% last week on a strong earnings print and upbeat guidance for the coming quarters. WDC has nearly doubled in 2025, riding the AI wave as its high-performance storage is critical for AI data centers. At $93, WDC trades at about 2x trailing revenues, modestly above its five-year average P/S of 1.7x. The relative discount to its historical average, as well as some peers, reflects its heavier exposure to the more volatile NAND segment, recent market drawdowns, and historical concerns about earnings cyclicality. Broadcom advanced 13% last week, buoyed by strong quarterly results and news of a new $10 billion custom AI chip order from a major customer—seen as a meaningful accelerant to revenue growth. Our recent analysis — AVGO Stock To $400 — outlines how Broadcom could potentially double again after a 135% gain over the last twelve months. The company is leveraging deep semiconductor expertise to deliver bespoke AI hardware for hyperscale, cloud, and enterprise buyers. Seagate shares rose 12%, supported by expectations for sustained AI-driven storage demand, with the stock up 115% year to date. The enthusiasm for high-capacity drives used in AI workloads has pushed STX’s valuation, now at 4x trailing revenues—well above its five-year average of 1.9x. That premium suggests the market is pricing in elevated demand and earnings durability. Micron gained 10%, largely on rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in AI infrastructure. Micron’s revenue multiple is 3.9x, close to its five-year average, implying today’s pricing reflects both current strength and cyclical risks—particularly as DRAM has entered an upcycle after a tough 2024, while NAND remains subdued. Even so, Micron may be AI’s best bargain. Google advanced 10% after a key regulatory win—a federal court found it wouldn’t need to divest Chrome, a platform we estimate is worth over a trillion to the ecosystem. The stock still appears relatively undervalued versus peers, with potential for an additional trillion-dollar upswing if further rulings are favorable; another decision due on September 10 could shape the next move. Remember, investing in a single stock—or a small handful—carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a 30-stock collection that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why? As a group, HQ names have delivered better returns with less volatility versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride—visible in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Adobe And Applied Materials Stand Out For Fat Profit Margins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/08/adobe-and-applied-materials-stand-out-for-fat-profit-margins/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T12:45:00Z
Full Content:
ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. High profits are the engine that can drive pleasant returns for shareholders. Beyond that, on a societal level, profits provide the signals that make the capitalist system work. These signals are the reason capitalist economies have fewer gluts and shortages than centrally planned (Communist) economies. High profits lure in new competitors, raising the supply of goods and services that are in high demand. Low profits cause some companies to abandon the field, in a process the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.” This is why we don’t currently have a glut of buggy whips or video cassettes. Here are five stocks that boast unusually high profit margins, and that I think deserve consideration as investments. You may know Adobe Inc. (ADBE) as the company whose software enables the display of graphics on your computer screen. Adobe has increased its sales at a 20% annual clip for the past decade, and profits have grown even faster. Adobe’s growth slowed in the past year, but the growth rate was still nicely into the teens. The company’s net (after tax) profit margin is 30%. The stock trades for 22 times recent earnings but only 15 times analysts’ estimate of earnings for 2026. I try not to be too influenced by personal experiences, but I have found Adobe’s customer service to be superb. One of the world’s largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is based in Santa Clara, California. Its sales growth over the past decade has been north of 17% a year. Its net profit margin is close to 24%. Although the stock has appreciated more than 900% in the past ten years, so far this year it’s down a small fraction. I think the weakness mostly reflects the U.S.-China trade conflict. Applied Materials gets about 25% of its sales in China. Based in Denver, Colorado, Anglogold Ashanti Plc (AU) is a gold mining company. Most of its mines are in Africa, but it also has mines in Australia and the Americas. The price of gold has risen more than 40% in the past year, amid government deficits, inflation, and international tensions. I think those problems will continue through 2026 and that gold’s momentum therefore will continue as well. Anglogold Ashani has a net profit margin of more than 23%. United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR), based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is known mainly for drugs to treat high blood pressure in the arteries around the lungs. I’ve owned the stock a couple of times over the years and regret that I haven’t owned it this year, since it jumped 33% in the past month. I sold my shares in 2024 because I thought that Merck & Co. might wrest away leadership in its niche. So far that hasn’t happened, and United Therapeutics is also developing drugs outside its traditional niche, such as treatments for liver and kidney disease. Its net margin is 40%. Zoom Communications Inc. (ZM) had first-mover advantage in the market for online meetings software. Lately Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have chipped into its market share. Zoom’s growth – spectacular during the pandemic – has flattened out. Nonetheless, Zoom remains a significant player in online meetings, with roughly half the market. Its net profit margin is a fat 25%. The stock, which rose above $500 in 2020, has subsided to $83, and I think it is probably a good buy at the current price. I’ve written 15 columns before this one on stocks with fat profit margins. Results have been mixed and strange, but a little more good than bad. The average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 16.3%. That beats the average return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return index over the same periods, which was 15.8%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. The odd thing is that my picks, while profitable 10 times out of 15, have beaten the index only four times. My average return beat the benchmark mainly because of great returns in 2014-2025 (83.2%) and 2020-2021 (78.6%). My picks from a year ago didn’t get traction. They were up only 0.1%, trailing the S&P by 15 percentage points, mostly because of a 37% loss in ON Semiconductor Corp. The best gainer was Snap-on Inc. (SNA), which returned 16.9%. Disclosure: I own Anglogold Ashanti personally and for most of my clients. I own Applied Materials for a few clients.

Today's top news: Friday was a big day for those companies entering the S&P 500. While a major crypto favorite was once again left out. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Robinhood (HOOD) will join the S&P 500 at the upcoming quarterly rebalance, replacing a departing constituent. HOOD shares immediately popped 7% on the news. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), despite checking all the requirement boxes, was not selected this cycle. MSTR’s recent price action certainly isn’t helping its case, down 16% this month while Bitcoin is only down 3%. It’s an exciting milestone to have Robinhood join the storied S&P 500 Index. I’ll share what I told the team today — we don’t stop to celebrate, our single focus remains building exceptional products for our customers. - Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO “Do you know which two companies didn’t make it into the S&P 500 last quarter despite meeting all the criteria? AppLovin and Robinhood. They were passed in June and both got in today on their second try. Same story with Uber and Tesla. Be patient. $MSTR will get there” - X user Angarlo First, the reason companies and their shareholders want to join the S&P is clear - huge rebalancing and ongoing inflows. Getting added to the S&P is almost a lock guarantee for near-term stock price increases (barring other macro factors). So it’s a big deal to be added. As for HOOD making it in over MSTR, the decision signals the committee’s preference for platform exposure over asset proxies. Robinhood’s inclusion validates a maturing, retail-first fintech that happens to have crypto in its product mix; it pulls another crypto-adjacent revenue stream directly into America’s most-tracked benchmark without making a call on any single token. By contrast, MicroStrategy’s pass suggests the S&P still wants operating cash flows and business diversification when it chooses members. For investors, the implication is straightforward: if you want crypto exposure inside the index, build a real business that uses it, don’t just warehouse it.

Title: CoinShares to Go Public in U.S. Through $1.2B SPAC Deal With Vine Hill

CoinShares, one of Europe’s largest digital asset managers, is heading to Wall Street. The company announced Monday that it will go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp (VCIC)., a Nasdaq-listed SPAC. The deal shifts CoinShares’ listing from Stockholm to New York, opening access to U.S. capital markets and investors. The firm manages about $10 billion in assets, including a suite of 32 crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) covering bitcoin, ether, solana and other tokens. CoinShares ranks as the fourth-largest global provider of digital asset ETPs, behind BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity, and holds a 34% share of the European, Middle Eastern and African market. Chief Executive Jean-Marie Mognetti said the move reflects a turning point for digital assets as U.S. regulation provides more clarity. “The case for digital assets as an investment class has reached a decisive inflection point,” he said. “A U.S. listing will reinforce our credibility and expand our reach.” For U.S. investors, the transaction could mean greater access to crypto-linked products from a manager that has grown assets more than 200% over the last two years. CoinShares reported a 76% adjusted EBITDA margin in the first half of 2025, signaling strong profitability compared with peers. The deal, approved by both companies’ boards, is expected to close by the end of 2025 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. If completed, CoinShares will trade on Nasdaq under a new parent company, Odysseus Holdings Limited.

Title: Fidelity Launches New Tokenized Fund as Market Nears $300B: Why Are Traders Joining Best Wallet Token?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Fidelity introduced the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT), an Ethereum-based tokenized share of the U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalents, on August 4, 2025. This marks Fidelity’s official entry into the landscape of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Earlier this month, the funds have spiraled to over $200M in assets. However, there has been minimal investor participation so far. Records show that only two holders have been identified so far — one holds almost $1M in tokens, and the other manages the rest. While Fidelity hasn’t made any official announcement yet, the Institution’s earlier SEC filing may have laid the groundwork for this launch. Nonetheless, this step signals its growing interest in real-world asset (RWAs) tokenization. And it certainly paves the way for more crypto adoption from institutions and retail users alike. As the past has shown, this often translates to positive chart action from altcoins, and one in particular, Best Wallet Token ($BEST), is making waves now. FDIT is an ERC-20 token that offers 24/7 transferability and several other exclusive features tailored for institutional investors. It invests in short-duration U.S. Treasury securities via the underlying OUSG token. Since its launch in August 2025, the Bank of New York Mellon has held the FDIT’s assets, ensuring traditional financial oversight. FDIT charges an annual management fee of 0.20% with no performance fees and is currently available exclusively to institutional investors. Fidelity’s token launch also marks the integration of blockchain technology into the traditional finance sector—a trend that improves liquidity, transparency, and increases operational efficiency. According to recent trends from Token Terminal, tokenized real-world assets have surpassed $300B, a milestone expected to be reached by 2030. Another report by RedStone states that RWAs on-chain could reach up to $30T by 2034. Furthermore, the recent FDIT launch signals the growing trust in Ethereum-based financial products. These trends, along with FDIT’s choice of Ethereum, reassure investors that it can handle serious, institutional-grade assets while also acting on the strong crypto vision many others (like Strategy) are sharing. Ultimately, this highlights that traditional finance is embracing blockchain technology. This union lays a strong bullish landscape for Ethereum-based projects. Building on this momentum, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale gives investors the best entryway to a growing Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s see why. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the utility token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial crypto wallet. The software-based wallet lets you buy, hold, and sell tokens on six major chains: Staking is coming soon, according to the roadmap, alongside market intel analytics, 60+ chain support, and even a Best Card for fiat transactions. Most importantly, Best Wallet is the only crypto wallet that lets you buy the best crypto presales from your mobile. No need to visit external sites! Joining the presale gives you access to premium features, like reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and community governance in a DAO ecosystem. The presale has raised over $15.6M so far, with a $70K whale buy on September 2 that indicates growing retail interest. The token is currently $0.025605 but our Best Wallet Token price prediction forecasts a price of $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, almost a 2x purely by holding the token. The presale concludes by December 31, 2025, or once all the tokens are sold. So, there’s still time to buy one of the best altcoins of 2025. To buy Best Wallet Token, visit the official presale page or read our ‘How to Buy $BEST’ guide! Fidelity’s FDIT launch reflects the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum-based financial products, emphasizing the potential of tokenized assets and their ability to transform traditional finance. As blockchain adoption gains momentum, investors are exploring early-stage investment opportunities like Best Wallet Token ($BEST), which capitalizes on the nascent stage of blockchain adoption. But remember that crypto is volatile, and this is not financial advice. Do your own research!

September 08, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: CoinShares International Limited CoinShares International Limited The leading European asset manager specializing in digital assets with ~US$10 billion in AuM sets sights on expanding into U.S. market CoinShares ranks among the top four managers globally by crypto ETP AuM alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale and holds the #1 market position in Europe with 34% market share CoinShares is experiencing a period of significant growth; AuM has more than tripled over the last two years through strong investor inflows, supportive digital asset pricing and successful new product launches CoinShares is bringing its global leadership to the large addressable U.S. market via a Nasdaq listing. This listing will enhance the company’s U.S. growth plans where it has recently launched product offerings, and is uniquely positioned to capitalize on market trends. Transaction is anchored by a fundamental institutional investor committing to invest US$50 millionin common equity Transaction represents US$1.2 billion pre-money equity value on a pro-forma basis SAINT HELIER, JERSEY AND FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA – SEPTEMBER 8, 2025 - CoinShares International Limited ("CoinShares" or "the Company") (Nasdaq Stockholm: CS; US OTCQX: CNSRF), the leading European asset manager specializing in digital assets with ~US$10 billion in AuM, and Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp., a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (“Vine Hill”) (NASDAQ: VCIC), today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) that will result in CoinShares becoming publicly listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States (together with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”). The transaction is expected to fuel CoinShares’ strategic international expansion and enable U.S. investors to participate more directly in its global growth, including expected growth in the United States. The transaction values CoinShares at US$1.2 billion pre-money on a pro-forma basis, positioning it as one of the largest publicly traded pure-play digital asset managers globally. Transaction Highlights Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO & Co-Founder of CoinShares said: “This transaction represents far more than a change of listing venue from Sweden to the United States. It signals a strategic transition for CoinShares, accelerating our ambition for global leadership, supported by favorable regulatory tailwinds. The case for digital assets as an investment class and blockchain as a transformative technology has reached a decisive inflection point and can no longer be ignored. There is no going back. The U.S. is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry. Our European playbook, built and refined over a decade, is proven and effective. We are now deploying this experience to bring a new suite of products to American investors. A U.S. listing will reinforce our credibility, expand our reach, and position us to capture the opportunity in the world’s largest asset management market, home to over half of global assets under management.2” Nicholas Petruska, CEO of Vine Hill said, “CoinShares exemplifies everything we look for in a high-value investment: market leadership, a proven, scalable business model, a massive and expanding addressable market and a team with the proven ability to execute. CoinShares’s proven EMEA playbook and expertise featuring a recurring fee-based revenue model supplemented with strong historical gains and income from a variety of trading activities which together have resulted in a consistently impressive ~70% adjusted EBITDA margins in CY2024, combined with U.S. capital markets access and distribution, creates an unstoppable growth engine.” The CoinShares Advantage Proven Market Leadership Operating Model Built for Scale Capitalizing on the U.S. Market Opportunity The boards of directors of both CoinShares and Vine Hill have unanimously approved the Business Combination which is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to shareholder approvals, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding CoinShares’ and Holdco’s present and future policies and plans and the environment in which CoinShares and Holdco will operate in the future. Many actual events or circumstances are outside of the control of CoinShares, Holdco or Vine Hill. Furthermore, certain forward‐looking statements are based on assumptions or future events which may not prove to be accurate, and no reliance whatsoever should be placed on any forward-looking statements in this press release. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (1) the Business Combination not being completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of Vine Hill’s and/or CoinShares’ securities; (2) the Business Combination not being completed by Vine Hill’s business combination deadline; (3) failure by the parties to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Business Combination, including the approval of Vine Hill’s and CoinShares’ shareholders and obtaining the requisite Acts of the Royal Court of Jersey; (4) failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of CoinShares and Holdco to grow and manage growth profitably, build or maintain relationships with customers and retain management and key employees, capital expenditures, requirements for additional capital and timing of future cash flow provided by operating activities and the demand for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related alternative investments, including those offered by, or underlying those offered by, CoinShares and Holdco; (5) the level of redemptions by Vine Hill’s public shareholders which will reduce the amount of funds available for CoinShares and Holdco to execute on their business strategies and may make it difficult to obtain or maintain the listing or trading of Holdco’s ordinary shares on a major securities exchange; (6) failure of Holdco to obtain or maintain the listing of its securities on any securities exchange after the closing; (7) costs related to the Business Combination and as a result of Holdco becoming a U.S.-listed public company that may be higher than currently anticipated;

(19) trading price and volume of Holdco ordinary shares may be volatile following the Business Combination and an active trading market may not develop; (20) Holdco shareholders may experience dilution in the future due to the exercise of a significant number of existing warrants and any future issuances of equity securities of Holdco; (21) investors may experience immediate and material dilution upon the closing as a result of the Vine Hill Class B ordinary shares held by Vine Hill Capital Sponsor I LLC, since the value of the Holdco ordinary shares received by Vine Hill Capital Sponsor I LLC in exchange for such Vine Hill Class B ordinary shares is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of Holdco ordinary shares at such time is substantially less than the price per share paid by investors; (22) conflicts of interest that may arise from investment and transaction opportunities involving Holdco, CoinShares, their respective affiliates and other investors and clients; (23) digital asset trading venues may experience greater fraud, security failures or regulatory or operational problems than trading venues for more established asset classes;

(25) a security breach, cyber-attack or other event where unauthorized parties obtain access to CoinShares’ or Holdco’s digital assets, as a result of which CoinShares or Holdco may lose some or all of their digital assets temporarily or permanently and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected; (26) the emergence or growth of other digital assets, including those with significant private or public sector backing, including by governments, consortiums or financial institutions, could have a negative impact on the value of digital assets and adversely affect CoinShares’ and/or Holdco’s business;

Title: Circle’s Revenue At Risk As Hyperliquid Opens Auction For USDH
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomerniv/2025/09/08/circles-revenue-at-risk-as-hyperliquid-opens-auction-for-usdh/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T11:25:11Z
Full Content:
ByTomer Niv, Contributor. Hyperliquid, the lightning-fast decentralized exchange that has captured more than 75% of the DeFi perpetuals market, is making its boldest move yet. Powered by its custom HyperCore chain, the platform can settle trades in under a quarter of a second and process hundreds of thousands of orders per second - performance that fueled $400 billion in trading volume in August 2025 alone. But Hyperliquid now wants more than just speed and liquidity - it wants control of the stablecoin layer at the heart of its ecosystem. That ambition takes shape with USDH, a proposed dollar-pegged stablecoin designed to redirect yield from the nearly $5 billion in deposits that currently enrich Circle’s USDC back into Hyperliquid’s own community. Instead of issuing the coin itself, Hyperliquid has turned the process into a public on-chain auction: issuers must openly compete, disclosing how much of the yield they will share, their compliance strategy, and the infrastructure they bring. Validators, acting as the decision-makers, will deliberate in public and then cast binding votes on-chain. This is more than a cost-saving move - it’s a DeFi governance experiment. Hyperliquid is effectively importing procurement practices from traditional finance into DeFi, forcing would-be issuers to compete on transparency, economics, and trust. The signal is unmistakable: USDH is being built to serve Hyperliquid’s community first, not an outside issuer’s bottom line. Until now, Hyperliquid’s rise has been fueled by USDC, Circle’s widely adopted dollar-backed stablecoin. Roughly 95% of the assets sitting on Hyperliquid are denominated in USDC, making the exchange one of Circle’s largest institutional “clients.” That amounts to nearly 7–8% of all USDC in circulation, a share so large it rivals major centralized exchanges. The revenue implications are enormous. Circle earns virtually all of its income by investing USDC reserves in short-term treasuries and money-market funds. According to public filings, more than 99% of Circle’s $1.68 billion in 2024 revenue came from this interest spread. If those reserves migrate into USDH, Circle faces a sudden loss of $150–200 million per year - roughly 10% of its business. That risk is amplified by timing. Circle has been working to launch native USDC and its cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP) on Hyperliquid, but delays left a window for USDH to seize the spotlight. The result: Circle, once the indispensable backbone of on-chain finance, now finds itself on the defensive. The USDH initiative isn’t just about reclaiming yield - it’s about rethinking how a decentralized protocol negotiates with its partners. By opening a public auction, Hyperliquid is treating the role of stablecoin issuer like a high-stakes procurement contract. Every bidder must explain how reserves will be managed, how much of the interest will flow back to the community, and what extra services they bring. The process mirrors corporate RFQs and government bond auctions, except that here it all plays out transparently on-chain. Validators, who stake HYPE tokens to secure the network, are the hiring committee. Their vote will determine not only who mints USDH but also how billions in yield are redistributed. For Hyperliquid, the motivation is straightforward. Why let Circle capture the spoils when those same billions could fund HYPE buybacks, validator rewards, and liquidity incentives? For DeFi at large, it is a glimpse of how governance can evolve from token votes on fee switches to community-controlled negotiations over billion-dollar contracts. Several issuers have thrown their hats into the ring, but three frontrunners stand out - each offering validators a different trade-off between trust, ethos, and firepower. Paxos: The Compliance Titan Frax Finance: The DeFi Native Agora: The Institutional Heavyweight Smaller entrants such as Native Markets and Konelia also submitted designs, but they have drawn limited validator support. The real decision lies between Paxos’ compliance clout, Frax’s community-first ethos, and Agora’s institutional scale. For Circle, the outcome could be devastating. Losing Hyperliquid’s billions would erase up to 10% of its revenue overnight, exposing its dependence on interest income and underscoring its vulnerability to client defection. CEO Jeremy Allaire has argued that USDC’s liquidity and interoperability will preserve its dominance, but the market isn’t convinced. Hyperliquid has demonstrated that if a protocol can align stablecoin incentives with its users, loyalty to USDC is far from guaranteed. For DeFi, the process is arguably more significant than the outcome. Hyperliquid has created a model where protocols can force vendors to compete in the open - on yield, compliance, liquidity, and governance. Instead of relying on closed-door deals, decentralized communities can now decide for themselves who manages their reserves. The USDH saga is a turning point in how decentralized platforms negotiate with centralized issuers. Hyperliquid has leveraged its balance sheet to flip the script, making issuers fight for access to its ecosystem and share their profits with the community. For Circle, it’s a wake-up call: the days of capturing billions in risk-free yield without sharing are numbered. For Hyperliquid, it’s a chance to transform USDC dependence into a self-reinforcing growth engine. And for the broader crypto industry, it’s a blueprint for how governance can evolve from symbolic token votes to billion-dollar procurement battles fought transparently on-chain. On September 14, Hyperliquid’s validators will decide which bidder mints USDH. Whichever way the vote goes, the precedent has been set: in the new era of DeFi, power flows to the protocols that control the capital - and they’re no longer willing to give it away for free.

Title: Ethereum Treasury shift: Fidelity gains, BlackRock’s outflows, and more
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-treasury-shift-fidelity-gains-blackrocks-outflows-and-more/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T10:00:56Z
Full Content:
Ethereum’s RWA crown tested as Fidelity steps into BlackRock’s Treasury turf. Ethereum holds 70% of the tokenized Treasury market. FDIT entered the top 10 with $203 million inflows, while BlackRock’s BUIDL shed $150 million. Ethereum [ETH] dominated 70% of the tokenized U.S. Treasury market. In numbers, $5.3 billion in tokenized Treasuries, bonds, and cash equivalents are flowing on Ethereum, accounting for over 70% of the total $7.46 billion tokenized Treasury market. Now, Fidelity has joined this sector of nearly 50 different tokenized U.S. Treasury offerings with the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT). The question is whether FDIT will pump more utility and liquidity into ETH’s DeFi stack. Sure, Fidelity’s making waves, but it’s not the first mover in the RWA game. The real heavyweight? BlackRock’s BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which still runs the show, with a solid $2.2 billion market cap in the tokenized Treasury space across multiple networks. Fidelity’s FDIT, by contrast, dropped solo on Ethereum. Within a short period, it grew to $203.7 million in assets and entered the top 10 Treasury products. Source: Rwa.xyz/treasuries Peep the 7-day flows: BUIDL was bleeding about $150 million, while FDIT was pulling in fresh liquidity left and right. That kind of on-chain rotation cements FDIT’s positioning, even in a crowded tokenized Treasury pool. In short, FDIT’s drop has seen solid on-chain adoption. Each token represents a share of FYOXX, backed by U.S. Treasuries. The bigger play? Ethereum’s still flexing as the go-to layer for institutional RWAs in DeFi. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries make up nearly 27% of the RWA stack. In other words, over a quarter of all on-chain RWAs are locked in low-risk, yield-bearing Treasury assets. This highlights just how dominant these U.S. gov-backed tokens are in DeFi’s real-world asset play. In this context, FDIT cracking the top 20 RWA assets isn’t a fluke. It’s proof of strong on-chain demand for tokenized Treasury products, with Ethereum devs clearly front-running the institutional RWA wave. Source: Rwa.xyz/networks/ethereum Right now, no chain comes close to Ethereum’s Treasury stack. ETH flexes 70% dominance, while Stellar lags at 6%, underscoring Ethereum’s grip. In fact, even after 95% stablecoin dominance, Treasuries still pull 3.15% of ETH’s market, showing serious on-chain RWA muscle. Fidelity’s move with FDIT just reinforces this. Dropping it on Ethereum taps into the network’s liquidity and dev infrastructure. Consequently, it allows them to stack market share and bolster their DeFi presence.

Title: Is efficiency misunderstood?
URL: https://www.techradar.com/pro/is-efficiency-misunderstood
Time Published: 2025-09-08T08:03:55Z
Full Content:
Energy efficiency drives sustainability, control, and competitive growth When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. When it comes to energy, terms like 'frugal’ or ‘efficiency’ can be perceived as ‘going without' or suggest having to make do with less. The reality is the opposite. Efficiency often improves our experience. In a world where energy demand is rising, becoming more volatile and costly, and climate pressures remain ever-present, efficiency offers more potential than ever. It’s no longer just a matter of operational performance. It’s about speed, comfort but also resilience, competitiveness, sustainability, and, increasingly, it’s about better control. Energy efficiency shouldn’t be viewed as a side benefit, but as the foundation for smarter growth. It should be seen as a powerful industry in its own right, and a crucial thread that runs through the success of other sectors. It’s what enables buildings, industries, and entire cities to function more intelligently and more sustainably for better life quality. Efficiency today is dynamic, digital, and deeply human. And unlocking it is one of the most powerful things we can do to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future while strengthening the systems we rely on every day. Businesses must evolve their mindset and see efficiency not just as a vehicle for cost savings, but as a fundamental driver of operations. EVP Energy Management, Schneider Electric. The traditional definition of efficiency—squeezing more value from fewer resources—remains relevant. But it’s also not enough. It’s about doing better—smarter operations, stronger margins, sharper control. It can also be the fastest and most cost-effective path to decarbonization. In fact, its importance to hitting our net zero goals, has seen the IEA declare energy efficiency the “first fuel” of clean energy transitions. In advanced economies, the bulk of efficiency savings are found through upgrading older infrastructure with new, more efficient solutions—things we’ve all heard of like switching to LEDs. However, more significant changes can and should be made to promote efficiency, from improving building efficiency to replacing HVAC systems. The IEA projected in 2021 that improving energy efficiency could deliver a reduction in annual energy-related emissions of 3.5 Gt CO2-eq (12%) compared with 2017 levels, delivering more than 40% of the abatement required to be in line with the Paris Agreement. The climate impact of efficiency is significant, but the wider impact to your organization is why it should be on your radar. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! As part of our decarbonization journey, efficiency might be the first fuel, but it’s the combination of electrification and digitalization, or what we call Electricity 4.0, that is supercharging its potential. Alone, each makes an impact. When combined, they are transformative, redefining efficiency across industries, cities and households. Electrification replaces fossil-fuel-based systems with electric alternatives—we’re seeing lots of examples of this in our day-to-day lives with things like heat pumps, EVs or even induction hobs. But these changes can also be at an industrial scale with changes to process heating in energy intensive applications. These technologies are inherently more efficient and, when powered by renewables, dramatically reduce emissions. While a powerful part of decarbonization, electrification’s impact is magnified with digital solutions. The digital revolution has transformed the way we understand and manage energy. Smart sensors, connected devices, and advanced analytics provide unprecedented visibility into how, when, and where energy is used. This data-driven approach enables organizations to identify inefficiencies and remedy them. But beyond this, digital tools can manage electricity demand and balance loads dynamically. This allows energy users to be more in control and actively manage demand to when renewable generation is highest – which is something traditional systems just cannot manage. Take your home for example. If you install energy management, such as smart thermostats, you save energy (and reduce energy bills) by applying energy exactly where you need it. As a result, not only do you save costs and carbon, you also get precise control and comfort, having rooms the exact temperature you want (vs just cold, warm or hot). These systems can even be enhanced with AI, incorporating weather forecasting to know that tomorrow will be warmer than today, so the boiler can start a bit later to reach your desired temperatures (saving even more energy and cost). What was once viewed purely as a cost-saving tactic is now becoming a steppingstone for organizations striving to become more competitive, and we’ve shown some of the ways you can increase efficiency and move to a more electric and digital approach. Energy efficiency no longer deserves to be relegated to an afterthought or a box ticking exercise. It belongs in boardroom strategies—driving profitability, resilience and brand strength. Businesses that use less energy are less exposed to price volatility and fossil fuel supply chain disruptions. And with smart, electrified systems, they can even participate in new energy markets—and even move into the prosumer space, becoming both consumers and producers of energy. This shift helps to future proof key elements of an organization’s cash flow and operations. However, the value of energy efficiency transcends the bottom line. Energy efficient operations are increasingly a signal of innovation and responsibility, resonating with customers, investors and regulators. It’s no surprise, then, that in their 2024 Investor Letter, BlackRock said companies that show a clear commitment to sustainability and efficiency are more likely to attract long-term capital. It bears reiterating that investing in efficiency is investing in a long-term saving. For many it’s also investing in more modern equipment which can offer a myriad of side benefits that weren’t previously considered within the move. But the long-term saving on energy bills can see knock on reductions in maintenance costs. Whether you’re counting savings in MWhs or dollars, you’re not counting the right thing with energy efficiency today. Instead, you should be looking at additional available spend for training, R&D or global expansion. You should be counting additional hours saved through better maintenance schedules or increased productivity due to a happier, healthier workforce. What you once knew to be true of efficiency isn’t wrong, it’s just too narrow for the value it can deliver today We've listed the best green web hosting.

Title: How Rich Is Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Really? Arkham’s 2025 Report

Time Published: 2025-09-08T07:30:00Z

Arkham Intelligence’s new deep-dive, shared via X on September 6, pegs Vitalik Buterin’s wealth at “at least $1.05 billion”—a lower-bound tally built from identified on-chain assets and known private holdings. The report situates the estimate as of August 2025 and emphasizes that it fluctuates intraday with Ether’s price. The backbone is Ether itself. Arkham attributes ~240,042 ETH to Buterin’s known wallets and notes that over 99% of his crypto portfolio value is in ETH. At the time of writing in the report, ETH was $4,321, implying roughly $1.04 billion of ETH exposure alone and explaining the tight co-movement between his net worth and ETH’s market cycle. Historically, Arkham reconstructs a precise balance-history curve. On December 31, 2015, Buterin’s known crypto wealth stood at $596,760; by December 31, 2016 it was $4.23 million, then $278.37 million a year later—his largest year-over-year jump in the 2017 bull run. He first crossed the on-chain billionaire mark at age 27 during 2021 as ETH traded above $3,000, and briefly peaked at $2.09 billion on November 18, 2021 with ETH near its cycle high. The subsequent bear market slashed the mark-to-market value by roughly 75%, from $1.2 billion (Dec 31, 2021) to $300.58 million (Dec 31, 2022), before recovering to $1.05 billion in the 2024–2025 rebound. “The peak of Vitalik’s crypto net worth was in May 2021, when 50% of the supply of the memecoin SHIB was sent to him and was briefly worth $20 Billion. Vitalik donated those tokens to charity and did not profit off of this memecoin,” Arkham writes. On ownership concentration, Arkham compares Buterin to other top-tier ETH holders. The ETH2 (Beacon) deposit contract leads with 66,887,347.41 ETH, followed by exchange and ETF-custody clusters (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, Grayscale, BlackRock). Arkham concludes Buterin is the largest identifiable individual with access to his coins, while Estonian banker Rain Lõhmus sits on ~250,000 ETH that are believed to be inaccessible due to lost keys. The Ethereum co-founder’s own disclosures anchor the percentages. In October 2018 he wrote: “I never had 900k ETH. When I had 0.9% of all ETH, the supply was ~75 million.” That statement frames Arkham’s finding that his share never materially exceeded ~0.9% and has trended down over time as he sold or donated and as supply evolved. Non-ETH positions are small in dollar terms but spelled out with exact counts. As of publication, Arkham shows 10,000,000,000 WHITE (~$3.72 million), 30,000,000,000 MOODENG (~$690,000), and 869,509 KNC (~$327,000) among his larger non-ETH tokens. The long tail includes $12,400 of TORN linked to Tornado Cash usage and 218,413,000 SHIB (~$2,720) remaining on known addresses. Buterin has publicly explained some of the flows that complicate “sales” tallies. In August 2022 he stated, “I’ll out myself as someone who has used [Tornado Cash] to donate to this exact cause,” referring to donations to Ukraine; he has also said that exchange-bound transfers from his wallets since 2018 have been for donations, not personal profit-taking. Off-chain, Arkham highlights early equity in zero-knowledge firm StarkWare, which reached an $8 billion valuation in its 2022 Series D—an illiquid but potentially meaningful additive to the on-chain floor. Precise sizing of these stakes is not disclosed, so Arkham treats the $1.05 billion as a conservative baseline rather than a cap. At press time, Ethereum traded at $4,298.

Time Published: 2025-09-08T03:24:53Z
Full Content:
Here is a look at the breaking news in digital marketing for May 2025. The world of digital marketing is experiencing a seismic shift, and the epicenters are social media and artificial intelligence. As of 2025, these two forces are no longer separate trends but a deeply integrated reality that is rewriting the playbook for brands, advertisers, and consumers alike. From the way you create content to how you connect with your audience, AI is unlocking new efficiencies and capabilities. Are you prepared to adapt your strategy for this new era? The latest breaking news in digital marketing signals a clear and irreversible move toward an AI-first approach. May 2025 has been a landmark month, with industry-shaking announcements that are forcing marketers to rethink their entire marketing strategy. The most significant marketing trends are now directly tied to AI's expanding role in search, advertising, and content discovery. These developments are not on the horizon; they are here now, impacting organic traffic, ad campaign creation, and how brands are perceived online. The following updates explore the critical changes you need to understand to stay competitive. This month, marketing leaders are buzzing about Google's recent announcements, which have profound implications for the industry. The company confirmed a major expansion of its AI Overviews in the U.S., fundamentally altering how search results are presented. This change prioritizes AI-generated summaries, pushing traditional organic listings further down the page and challenging how digital marketers approach SEO. Simultaneously, Google unveiled "AI Max" at its Marketing Live event, an advanced AI-driven platform designed to automate the creation of entire paid search campaigns. While promising efficiency, it raises questions about strategic control and brand consistency. These announcements underscore a critical turning point where leveraging AI is no longer optional for achieving business goals. For many, this signals a need to adapt quickly or risk becoming invisible in a search landscape increasingly curated by algorithms. The focus now shifts to how brands can influence these AI systems to protect their visibility and bottom line. This week's hot topics in digital marketing revolve around adapting to an AI-dominated landscape. Marketers are grappling with significant drops in organic traffic, with some studies showing a 15-30% decrease for informational queries due to AI-driven search summaries. This has ignited a race to find new opportunities for visibility. The conversation is centered on practical strategies for this new reality. Performance marketing experts are particularly focused on how to maintain and improve campaign performance when the rules are changing so rapidly. Key discussions from the last week of May 2025 include: These highlights show a clear trend: marketers are moving from discussing AI's potential to actively developing tactics to manage its real-world impact. The social media trends of 2025 are being profoundly shaped by AI, which is disrupting everything from content discovery to user interaction. AI algorithms are not just personalizing feeds; they are creating entirely new ways for users to engage with brands and each other. This is causing a noticeable shift in user behavior across all major social media platforms. As a result, what worked last year may not be effective today. Brands must now contend with AI-driven features that influence what content gets seen and how conversations unfold. The following sections explore how new platforms are emerging and how brands are adapting to this dynamic environment. New social platforms and AI-integrated features are rapidly changing consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. This demographic, in particular, is embracing more interactive and autonomous AI-powered experiences. Instead of static search bars, users are turning to conversational AI assistants within apps to get answers, schedule appointments, and even receive product recommendations. This shift is forcing brands to reconsider the type of content they produce and where they publish it. The emphasis is moving toward providing utility and instant support. Some of the key features gaining traction include: U.S. marketers are reacting by investing in chatbot technology and exploring how to integrate their brands into these new conversational interfaces, recognizing that this is the future of digital interaction. To foster stronger connections with customers, brands are leveraging AI to enable real-time engagement like never before. The goal is to move beyond generic messaging and interact with audiences at the right time with the right offer. This means personalizing every touchpoint of the customer journey, from the first ad they see to post-purchase support. One powerful example is TSB Bank, which used real-time data to personalize loan offers based on recent customer activity. This single change led to a 300% increase in mobile loan sales. This demonstrates the immense potential of using AI to analyze behavior as it happens and respond instantly with relevant content. This proactive approach to engagement is becoming the new standard. Brands are adapting by integrating AI tools that can predict customer needs and automate personalized outreach, ensuring that their message is not only seen but also feels uniquely tailored to each individual. Generative AI has officially moved from a niche technology to a cornerstone of modern digital marketing. Its impact is most visible in content generation, where it is unlocking new capabilities for creating copy, images, and even video at an unprecedented scale. This is fundamentally changing the economics and speed of content marketing. However, the rise of generative AI is about more than just efficiency. It's empowering marketers to test creative variations faster, personalize messaging with greater precision, and uncover insights that guide strategy. The following sections will show how this technology is driving both creativity and hyper-personalization across digital channels. Generative AI is revolutionizing content production by acting as a copilot for content creators. Tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway are now standard in many marketing departments, helping to accelerate everything from brainstorming initial concepts to producing final assets. This allows teams to iterate on ideas much faster than before. As Ron Friedman, Vice President at Mattel Future Lab, states, "Weâre using generative AI as a copilot for ideation, helping us iterate and validate ideas quickly." This sentiment is echoed across industries. For example, Eric Perez at iHeartMedia notes that in a fast-paced environment, AI is a "game changer" for speeding up concept development without sacrificing quality. This technology is not replacing human creativity but augmenting it. It handles the heavy lifting of initial drafts and visual mockups, freeing up marketers to focus on strategy, brand nuance, and the emotional connection that only a human touch can provide. The result is a more efficient and dynamic content creation process. Achieving true personalization at scale has long been a goal for marketers, and AI is finally making it a reality. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real time, AI enables brands to deliver a superior customer experience by serving highly relevant content across all digital channels, from websites to email to social media. However, a significant gap remains between consumer expectations and brand delivery. An Adobe report found that while 71% of consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, only 34% of brands are successfully doing so. AI-enhanced personalization aims to close this gap by moving from segment-based targeting to one-on-one interactions. As Leo Griffin of HanesBrands Inc. explains, "Personalization helps our consumers feel known." This is the core of the strategy: using AI not just to sell, but to build relationships. Brands like Danish telecom provider Telmore are already seeing results, with their AI-driven personalization efforts delivering an 11% sales lift. May 2025 has seen a surge in new AI tools designed to give marketers a competitive edge. These innovative solutions offer new capabilities for everything from consumer research to ad campaign management. The rapid adoption of AI is being driven by tools that are not only powerful but also increasingly accessible to teams of all sizes. One of the most talked-about launches was Google's AI Max platform, but it is just one of many new technologies entering the market. The following sections highlight some of the other groundbreaking solutions that are helping marketers work smarter and achieve better results. Beyond major platform updates, a range of innovative AI solutions are empowering digital marketers to refine their marketing strategy. These tools are designed to solve specific challenges, from understanding consumer sentiment to optimizing content for search engines. Many are becoming indispensable parts of the modern marketing tech stack. One standout tool is GWI Spark, an AI assistant that provides instant consumer insights from global survey data, allowing marketers to ask questions in natural language and get actionable answers in seconds. This democratizes research and enables faster, more data-driven decision-making. Other key solutions gaining traction include: These tools are not just about automation; they provide strategic insights that help marketers stay ahead of the curve. Major digital advertising platforms are deeply embedding AI into their core offerings, making these AI tools essential for running effective marketing campaigns. These platform integrations are designed to automate and optimize tasks that were once manual, from bidding to creative testing. For marketers, understanding these native tools is just as important as adopting third-party solutions. Google and Meta, for example, have baked AI into nearly every aspect of their advertising products. This helps advertisers improve targeting, generate ad variations, and predict campaign performance with greater accuracy. The goal is to deliver better results with less manual effort, allowing teams to focus more on high-level strategy. Here is a look at some key platform-specific AI integrations as of May 2025: Platform AI Integration/Feature Primary Use Case Google Ads AI Max Generates entire campaigns (headlines, assets, keywords) from a landing page and brand prompts. Google Search AI Overviews Creates AI-generated summaries at the top of search results, changing SEO dynamics. Meta Ads Advantage+ Campaigns Automates audience targeting, ad placement, and creative delivery to maximize performance. GWI GWI Spark An AI research assistant that generates consumer insights from proprietary data on demand. These integrations demonstrate a clear industry trend toward AI-powered automation and optimization within the largest digital ecosystems. Google Marketing Live 2025 was a pivotal event for marketing leaders, with announcements centered on the next evolution of AI in Google Ads. The headline news was the launch of "AI Max," a new platform designed to take Performance Max a step further by using generative AI to build entire campaigns with minimal human input. This development presents both new opportunities and new challenges. While it promises to streamline campaign creation and improve efficiency, it also raises important questions about creative control and strategic oversight. The following sections break down the key innovations revealed at the event. The biggest news in paid search to come out of Google Marketing Live 2025 is AI Max. This platform uses generative AI to build complete campaignsâincluding headlines, descriptions, creative assets, and keyword strategiesâfrom just a landing page URL and a few brand prompts. The goal is to radically simplify the launch of high-performing campaigns and improve overall search performance. Google positions AI Max as a smarter, faster way to achieve results, with predictive insights to guide advertisers. For time-pressed teams, this level of automation could be a significant advantage. It promises to optimize bidding and targeting in ways that are difficult to replicate manually, potentially leading to better visibility in search results. However, advertisers are proceeding with caution. While the efficiency gains are clear, many are wary of handing over complete strategic control to an algorithm. Concerns about brand consistency and the inability to fine-tune campaigns beyond AI Max's suggestions are prevalent. Marketers will need to find a balance between leveraging this powerful automation and maintaining their unique brand voice. The integration with Google Analytics will be crucial for measuring its true impact. While much of the focus at Google Marketing Live was on search, the new AI capabilities also have major implications for display campaigns and social media marketing. The generative AI within platforms like AI Max can create a wide variety of visual assets and ad copy, making it easier for marketers to test different creative approaches across Google's Display Network and YouTube. This allows for the rapid creation of diverse ad campaigns tailored to different audience segments. By automating the generation of images and ad variations, marketers can run more complex tests to see what resonates best with their audience, ultimately improving campaign performance without a proportional increase in creative workload. These enhancements are designed to make cross-channel advertising more cohesive and efficient. The ability to generate assets for display and video alongside search ads from a single set of prompts streamlines the entire campaign creation process. It empowers marketers to maintain a consistent brand message while optimizing performance on every platform. The theoretical benefits of generative AI are compelling, but what do they look like in practice? A growing number of case studies are demonstrating how this technology is driving better results and transforming campaign performance across various industries. These real-world examples show that AI is not just a buzzword but a practical tool for achieving tangible business outcomes. From social media to video content, brands are finding innovative ways to apply AI for higher engagement and greater efficiency. The following examples highlight some of the most successful digital campaigns powered by AI as of May 2025. While specific case studies for May 2025 are just emerging, we can look at how leading brands are applying AI principles to their social media platforms. A notable example involves a global consumer goods brand, similar to L'OrÃ©al or NestlÃ©, that utilized AI tools to overhaul its social media marketing campaigns. The goal was to increase relevance among a younger demographic. The brand used a generative AI platform to create hundreds of visual variations for its ads, each tailored to different audience micro-segments identified by a predictive analytics tool. This allowed them to move beyond broad demographic targeting and speak to individual interests and behaviors. The AI also monitored social media sentiment in real time, allowing the marketing team to adjust messaging on the fly. The results were impressive. The campaign saw a significant lift in key metrics, achieving higher engagement rates and a lower cost per acquisition compared to previous, less-personalized efforts. This success demonstrates how combining generative AI for content with predictive AI for targeting can create a powerful and effective social media strategy. AI is significantly accelerating the production of video content and other forms of creative content. In today's fast-paced content marketing environment, the demand for fresh, engaging visuals is relentless. Generative AI tools like Runway are enabling marketing teams to meet this demand by automating parts of the video creation process, from generating initial storyboards to producing short-form video clips for social media. This technology is not about creating feature films but about streamlining the content generation workflow for marketing campaigns. For instance, a brand can use AI to quickly create multiple versions of a product promo video, each with different background music, text overlays, and calls to action. This allows for rapid A/B testing to determine which version performs best with a target audience. This approach frees up creative teams from repetitive editing tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-level concepts and storytelling. By integrating AI into their creative strategies, brands can produce more content, test more ideas, and ultimately deliver more effective campaigns without burning out their creative resources. The impact of AI on website design and optimization is transformative. AI is enabling a shift from static, one-size-fits-all websites to dynamic, personalized digital experiences. This technology is also reshaping SEO strategies, as marketers must now optimize for both traditional search engine crawlers and the AI algorithms that power generative search results. Are you using AI to its full potential on your website? The following sections explore how AI can create deeply personalized user journeys and dramatically improve conversion rates, turning your website into a more intelligent and effective marketing tool. Creating a truly personalized user experience is a top priority for digital marketers, and AI tools are making it possible. Instead of showing every visitor the same homepage, AI can dynamically alter content, product recommendations, and messaging based on a user's past behavior, location, and other data points. This creates a much more relevant and engaging customer experience. For example, an e-commerce site can use AI to showcase products that a specific user is likely to be interested in, based on their browsing history. A B2B website might highlight case studies from the visitor's industry. This level of personalization makes visitors feel understood and valued, which can significantly increase engagement and loyalty. Vanguard provides a powerful example of this in action. By using technology to deliver updated, personalized content, the company saw a 176% increase in quality engagement on its new website. This shows that when personalization is done right, the results can be dramatic. Improving conversion rates is a core goal of any digital marketing strategy, and new AI tools are providing powerful new levers for optimization. These tools go beyond traditional A/B testing by using machine learning to analyze user behavior, identify friction points in the customer journey, and automatically test thousands of design and copy variations. For example, an AI tool can analyze session recordings to identify where users are dropping off in the checkout process. It could then suggest and automatically implement changes to the user interface to make the process smoother. This allows for continuous, data-driven optimization that would be impossible to manage manually. This AI-powered approach to conversion rate optimization (CRO) is gaining popularity because it delivers measurable results. By constantly learning and adapting, these tools can significantly lift conversion rates over time. This frees up marketers to focus on the overall strategy while the AI handles the granular details of on-page optimization. AI-powered advertising is quickly becoming the new standard in digital advertising. These strategies use AI to optimize every aspect of a campaign, from identifying the ideal target audience to allocating marketing budgets in real time. This data-driven approach allows for a level of precision and efficiency that was previously unattainable. Marketers are embracing these strategies because they deliver better performance and a higher return on investment. The following sections explore two of the most popular AI-powered tactics gaining traction in May 2025: hyper-targeting and automated ad creation. One of the most powerful applications of AI in advertising is hyper-targeting, which is made possible by dynamic audience segmentation. Instead of creating broad audience buckets, AI can analyze thousands of data signals in real time to group users into highly specific micro-segments based on their current behavior and predicted intent. This process relies heavily on predictive analytics. AI models can forecast which users are most likely to convert, allowing advertisers to focus their ad spend on the most promising prospects. This provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps ensure that ad messages are delivered only to those who will find them most relevant. For example, an online retailer could use AI to identify a segment of users who have recently searched for a specific product, visited a competitor's website, and shown a high likelihood of making a purchase in the next 24 hours. This level of precision makes ad campaigns dramatically more effective and reduces wasted ad spend. The automation of ad creation and performance monitoring is freeing up marketing teams from tedious, time-consuming tasks. With AI tools like Google's AI Max, marketers can now generate hundreds of ad variationsâincluding text, images, and headlinesâin a matter of minutes. This allows for more extensive testing and optimization than ever before. Once campaigns are live, AI continues to play a crucial role in performance monitoring. AI systems can track key metrics in real time, identify underperforming ads, and automatically reallocate budget to the best-performing creative. Some advanced systems can even create new ad variations on the fly based on what's currently resonating with the audience. This level of automation empowers marketing teams to operate at a much larger scale and with greater agility. It allows them to move away from manual campaign management and focus on strategic planning, creative direction, and analyzing the high-level insights that the AI provides. AI is revolutionizing analytics and reporting by making data analysis happen in real time. Instead of waiting for weekly or monthly reports, marketers can now get instant insights into campaign performance. This is particularly valuable for performance marketing, where quick adjustments can have a significant impact on results. These AI innovations are turning data into a strategic asset that can be used to make faster, smarter decisions. The following sections explore how AI is enabling predictive insights and helping brands detect trends and manage crises more effectively. How could your team benefit from instant access to these insights? Predictive analytics is one of the most transformative applications of AI for marketers. By analyzing historical data and real-time trends, AI models can forecast future outcomes, such as which customer segments are likely to grow or which marketing channels will deliver the best ROI. These valuable insights empower marketers to make proactive, data-driven marketing decisions. According to a 2025 Adobe report, leveraging AI and predictive analytics is a top priority for 65% of senior executives aiming for growth. This is because these technologies provide a forward-looking view that helps guide everything from budget allocation to product development. Instead of reacting to past performance, teams can now anticipate market shifts and consumer needs before they even happen. This allows them to allocate resources more effectively and design marketing efforts that are positioned for future success, giving them a significant competitive advantage. In today's fast-moving digital world, real-time trend detection and rapid crisis response are essential. AI tools are becoming indispensable for this, as they can monitor millions of conversations on social media and other online platforms to identify emerging trends and potential PR crises before they escalate. By analyzing sentiment, volume, and the context of online mentions, AI can alert marketing teams to a sudden spike in negative comments or a new meme format that is going viral. This gives brands the ability to respond quickly and appropriately. For trend detection, AI can spot shifts in consumer interests, helping brands create relevant content that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Digital marketing professionals have reacted to the AI updates in May 2025 with a mix of excitement and urgency. They see the potential of these tools for proactive brand management but also recognize the need to develop new workflows to leverage these real-time insights effectively. The rapid adoption of AI is reshaping the digital marketing skills required to succeed in the modern job market. The most valuable members of marketing teams are no longer just specialists in a single channel but professionals who possess a strong degree of AI literacy. They understand how to work alongside AI to achieve better results. This shift is creating new roles and evolving existing ones. The following sections outline the essential skills that digital marketers need to cultivate in 2025 and discuss the importance of training and upskilling to keep pace with technological change. To maintain a competitive advantage, digital marketers must cultivate a new set of must-have skills centered around human-AI collaboration. Marketers who know how to effectively use AI will have a significant edge over those who do not. This isn't about becoming a data scientist; it's about understanding how to leverage AI tools to enhance marketing strategy and execution. These skills enable marketers to guide AI systems, interpret their outputs, and ensure that all automated efforts align with brand goals. The most successful marketing teams will be those that blend technical proficiency with strategic and creative thinking. Key skills for 2025 include: Developing AI literacy across marketing teams is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Forward-thinking organizations are proactively investing in training programs to upskill their employees, ensuring they are comfortable and proficient with the new generation of AI tools. This is crucial for successful AI adoption and for maintaining a competitive edge. These training initiatives range from internal workshops and bootcamps to hands-on sessions with the specific AI tools being used every day. The goal is not to turn every marketer into an AI expert but to build a baseline level of understanding and confidence. When teams feel empowered to use AI, they are more likely to find innovative ways to apply it to their work. Ultimately, the objective is to make AI feel like a natural part of the marketing workflowâa powerful assistant that helps teams work smarter, not a complex technology to be feared. This investment in human capital is just as important as the investment in the technology itself. As AI marketing becomes more powerful, the issues of data privacy, ethics, and trust move to the forefront. Effective personalization relies on data, but consumers are increasingly concerned about how their information is being used. Building and maintaining trust is non-negotiable for long-term success. Striking the right balance between delivering personalized experiences and ensuring robust consumer data protection is a critical challenge. The following sections explore how marketers can navigate this complex landscape by addressing issues like bias and transparency. The central challenge in modern marketing is balancing effective personalization with the non-negotiable need for consumer data protection. While consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, they are also highly concerned about data privacy. This creates a significant trust gap that brands must bridge. According to a 2025 Adobe report, a staggering 88% of consumers believe it's important for brands to handle their data responsibly, yet only 49% of organizations are perceived as meeting this expectation. This gap undermines the very foundation of personalization, as customers will not willingly share data with brands they do not trust. To navigate this, marketers must be transparent about how they collect and use data. This means providing clear privacy policies, giving users control over their information, and ensuring that all data is handled securely. Building trust is not just a legal requirement; it is a strategic imperative for any brand that wants to build lasting customer relationships. A critical aspect of ethical AI involves addressing algorithmic bias and ensuring transparency. AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data contains historical biases, the AI's outputâwhether it's ad targeting or content generationâwill perpetuate and even amplify those biases. This can lead to skewed campaigns and significant reputational damage. Marketers must be vigilant and question the outputs of their AI tools. It's crucial to understand where the data is coming from and to regularly review campaigns for any signs of unfair bias. This requires a commitment to ethics that goes beyond simple compliance. Furthermore, the question of transparency with consumers is becoming more pressing. Should audiences be informed when content is AI-generated? While standards are still evolving, a move toward greater transparency is essential for building long-term trust. Being open about the use of AI can help manage customer expectations and reinforce a brand's commitment to ethical practices. While the benefits of AI are clear, there are several AI challenges that can slow down digital marketing adoption. These hurdles are often not just technological but also organizational. Issues like integrating AI with legacy technology and managing the human side of change are common roadblocks for many companies. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires a strategic approach that focuses on both systems and people. The following sections explore how to tackle integration issues and foster effective human-AI collaboration to ensure a smooth and successful transition. One of the most significant practical hurdles in AI adoption is the integration of AI tools with existing legacy technology. Many organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses, operate on a patchwork of older systems, such as CRMs, CDPs, and analytics platforms. These fragmented systems often create data silos that prevent AI from working effectively. According to a 2025 Adobe report, 32% of organizations point to fragmented IT systems as a key barrier to progress. Attempting to layer sophisticated AI applications on top of a disconnected data foundation often leads to disappointing results. The AI can't access the real-time, unified data it needs to deliver true personalization. To overcome this, organizations must prioritize data unification. This doesn't always mean ripping and replacing old systems. Instead, it can involve investing in platforms that are built for interoperability and can connect disparate data sources. A clear data strategy is the essential first step to unlocking the full potential of AI in digital marketing. While AI promises efficiency, its implementation can sometimes lead to AI fatigue among marketing teams. The pressure to adopt new tools, learn new skills, and manage AI-generated outputs can add strain to existing workflows. A recent study found that 56% of marketing and CX teams report that implementing generative AI creates extra work. The key to avoiding this burnout is to foster a healthy model of human-AI collaboration. This means clearly defining roles: AI handles the heavy liftingâdata analysis, content generation, task automationâwhile humans provide strategic direction, creative judgment, and ethical oversight. This partnership allows teams to benefit from AI's speed and scale without being overwhelmed by it. This collaborative approach is crucial in areas like customer support, where AI chatbots can handle routine inquiries, freeing up human agents to manage more complex and emotionally nuanced issues. By framing AI as a supportive partner rather than a replacement, organizations can build a more sustainable and effective marketing operation. A number of pioneering US brands are already demonstrating the power of AI-driven marketing. Their successes offer valuable case studies and a blueprint for other organizations looking to leverage AI. These companies are moving beyond pilot programs and are embedding AI into their core strategies, leading to measurable improvements in campaign performance. From retail to finance to media, these early adopters are showcasing what's possible when technology is combined with a clear vision. The following examples highlight some of the key learnings and impressive results from these industry leaders. The enterprise adoption of AI is providing powerful case studies and practical learnings for the entire industry. These examples show how large organizations are using AI to solve real-world business problems and unlock new opportunities for growth. A key learning is that success often starts with a specific, well-defined problem. Rather than attempting a massive, all-encompassing AI transformation, leading companies are focusing on high-impact use cases first. This allows them to demonstrate ROI quickly and build momentum for broader adoption. Here are a few examples of how US brands are successfully using AI: The success of AI in marketing is ultimately measured by its impact on the bottom line. The most compelling metrics from May 2025 go beyond vanity numbers and demonstrate tangible business results. These figures provide valuable insights into how AI is improving campaign performance and driving revenue growth. One of the most striking results comes from TSB Bank. By using real-time data to personalize loan offers, the bank increased its mobile loan sales by an incredible 300%. This metric directly ties an AI-driven strategy to a significant increase in sales, showcasing a clear return on investment. Similarly, Danish telecom provider Telmore reported an 11% sales lift from its AI-driven personalization efforts compared to non-personalized experiences. At Vanguard, a focus on personalized web content led to a 176% increase in quality engagement. These are the metrics that matterâthe ones that prove AI is not just a cost center but a powerful engine for growth. Looking ahead, the future outlook for digital marketing is one of ever-deepening AI collaboration. The synergy between social media and AI will continue to evolve, creating new opportunities for brands to connect with audiences in more meaningful and efficient ways. The era of proactive, predictive marketing is just beginning. This next phase will move beyond simple automation to more autonomous systems that can anticipate consumer needs and orchestrate complex customer journeys. What emerging trends should you be preparing for as we head into the second half of 2025? As we look toward the end of the year and into the next year, one of the most significant emerging trends is the rise of "agentic AI." This represents the next evolution of virtual assistants. Instead of just responding to commands, agentic AI systems will be autonomous agents that can take initiative on behalf of the user. Imagine a shopping assistant on a social media app that doesn't just recommend products but, with permission, proactively adds items to a cart based on your style preferences and upcoming events. Or a travel assistant that not only finds flights but also books them, arranges transportation, and suggests itineraries. This is the promise of agentic AI: a concierge-like experience that offers unparalleled convenience and personalization. This shift will move marketing from being reactive to truly proactive, where brands can anticipate and fulfill customer needs before they are even explicitly stated. For marketers, the challenge will be to build the trust and data infrastructure required to power these advanced, autonomous experiences. Increasingly sophisticated consumer expectations demand that marketing teams align their strategies with the dynamic landscape of digital behaviors. Gen Z, for instance, seeks authentic engagement across social media platforms, showcasing the importance of crafting relevant content that resonates with younger audiences. As real-time data analysis becomes more prevalent, businesses utilizing predictive analytics can better refine their marketing campaigns. The incorporation of AI tools also allows for personalized product recommendations and customer service enhancement, fostering stronger connections and ultimately improving conversion rates. This shift not only reshapes customer journeys but also presents new opportunities for marketing leaders to achieve their business goals.

Focusing on the customer journey is crucial; personalized content and refined email marketing strategies can significantly enhance performance metrics. Embracing these trends will empower businesses to create stronger connections with their target audience, ultimately driving conversions and maximizing the bottom line. In 2025, key AI updates in digital marketing included advanced predictive analytics for consumer insights, enhanced personalization through machine learning algorithms, and automated content generation tools. These innovations significantly improved targeting strategies and customer engagement, aligning with evolving consumer expectations and behaviors. Marketers are adapting to rapid changes in social media and AI by embracing innovative strategies, enhancing customer interaction through personalized content, and leveraging data analytics. This proactive approach helps them stay relevant, meet evolving consumer expectations, and drive engagement effectively. Brands should explore AI-powered tools like chatbots for customer support, sentiment analysis for engagement insights, and content generation platforms to streamline marketing efforts. These tools not only enhance customer experiences but also improve operational efficiency in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. â

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, or HSG, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are breaking records, nearing $300 billion in 2025, with some projections placing the market at $30 trillion by 2034. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. According to recent data by Token Terminal, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are already nearing $300 billion, a milestone that was projected to be reached in 2030. An additional report by RedStone Finance found that RWAs on-chain could hit as much as $30 trillion by 2034. While most of the momentum is made up of stablecoins like USDT and USDC, with Ethereum and Tron emerging as the big winners in asset tokenization, don’t blink and miss the broader trend: stablecoins lead, but funds are rising. On-chain funds, treasuries, and bonds are all rapidly carving out a bigger slice of the pie, moving capital markets from sleepy bank vaults onto global, blockchain rails that trade around the clock. Tokenized RWAs include much more than dollars in disguise. Earlier this week, Coinbase announced that it would launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure. Government bonds like Ondo USDY and BlackRock’s BUIDL, tokenized money-market funds, gold tokens such as PAXG, and even fractionalized real estate shares are now also a reality. Commodities aren’t left behind either. There’s over $2.5 billion in digital gold, $500 million in tokenized oil, and millions in tokenized silver, agricultural goods, and even carbon credits. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, calls tokenization a “revolution” in investing, envisioning a future where “every asset can be tokenized” and traded with global reach and instant settlement.

Stay connected via This isn’t just fintech hype. According to McKinsey and Token Terminal, institutional adoption is ramping up; tokenized RWAs alone are set to double in size as funds and treasuries jump ship to the blockchain. The move beyond stablecoins highlights a new era for capital markets, and the implications are far-reaching. Imagine having 24/7 access to traditional financial (TradFi) assets, democratized by fractional shares, with no more waiting days for trades to settle. Rather than relying on a centralized provider or a shadowy broker, every transaction is traceable and programmable, with assets directly managed on decentralized platforms, fast-tracking liquidity and efficiency. As funds and institutional assets sprint on-chain, the $300 billion milestone that was expected to be hit in 2030 marks not just growth but a sea change: the financial system is stepping off Wall Street and into global, programmable networks, changing where (and how) finance happens. Stablecoins were the start. Now, the tokenization wave is carrying funds, bonds, commodities, and even art. The next chapters? Real estate, private credit, and markets yet to be imagined, all open, frictionless, and unstoppable.

Title: Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Claims Of Coinbase Manipulating XRP Price Are ‘Highly Unlikely’

Data from multiple blockchain trackers shows that Coinbase has drastically cut its XRP holdings, a move that has taken many crypto investors by surprise. Analysts say such a huge reduction points to large outflows from institutional investors, but others have gone further by alleging manipulation. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has poured cold water on these claims. US-based exchange Coinbase recently reduced its stash from more than 780 million XRP to just under 200 million in a matter of weeks. This translates to a 69% reduction in the exchange’s holdings since the second quarter of 2025, including a 57% plunge over the last month alone. The scale of the drawdown has also shifted Coinbase’s ranking among exchange holders of XRP, sliding it from the fifth largest to barely in the top 10. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. In a detailed thread, the commentator claimed that nearly 40% of the outflows were routed through OTC desks tied to New York institutions and that the timing of the sales coincided with XRP price dips in August. According to the thread, more than 70% of the volume was unloaded during low-liquidity trading hours, while fragmented routing across wallets masked the scale of the sales. The thread even suggested that some of the XRP ended up with BlackRock-linked custodial wallets, a move that further points to theories about institutional involvement. Bill Morgan was quick to reject the idea that Coinbase is actively manipulating XRP’s price. In his view, the theory overlooks the fact that XRP has exhibited the same behavior throughout its history, including during the long stretch when Coinbase delisted the asset and had no apparent influence on its market activity. Coinbase suspended XRP trading in January 2021, but it wasn’t until July 2023 that the cryptocurrency started trading again on the US-based exchange. “One heck of a theory about Coinbase being against XRP,” he said, before noting that the token’s movements today are consistent with its established trends. The suggestion of manipulation by Coinbase fails to hold up, as XRP’s price action appears more reflective of broader crypto market movement than any deliberate suppression by the exchange. XRP has been trading within a well-defined range between $2.8 and $2.9 in the past seven days. Although it lost the $3 support level as August came to a close, XRP has managed to hold above $2.8 since then, and this level has so far cushioned it from deeper losses. On the upside, the $3.10 level is the critical resistance to watch. A decisive break above that barrier could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Until then, XRP’s price is likely to continue consolidating between $3.10 and $2.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.82.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

(NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth.

(NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Title: 6 Small Cap Dividends With Super-Sized Yields Of Up To 19%

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Small companies are sneaky AI-friendly plays because they are implementing these tools faster than their larger competitors. Expect to see these smaller firms become more efficient in the quarters ahead. Sales will continue to increase while headcounts will remain relatively flat as robots take up the slack—a boon to future profits. Ironically, small caps are currently the cheapest sector on the board: So, we turn our attention to a six pack of small but mighty dividend payers. Let’s start with a lender that yields “only” 15.7% per year and work our way up from there. We discussed BlackRock TCP Capital (TCPC, 15.7% yield) recently as part of our “unloved stocks” focus. This business development company (BDC) invests in more than 150 companies across 20 industries, with a penchant for first-lien debt. It really began underperforming with gusto in 2023; it’s currently restructuring deals amid portfolio credit issues, so things don’t look much better now. But TCPC’s woes have opened up a wide 18% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—that and a 14% regular yield (with an additional 1.7% from specials) might tempt some distressed-asset buyers. That said, the vast majority of BDCs trade for less than their NAV right now, and most of them sit in the small-cap space, so perhaps there’s more fertile ground elsewhere. For instance, New Mountain Finance (NMFC, 12.1% yield) offers a double-digit yield and a double-digit discount to NAV (14%). NMFC deals in U.S. upper-middle-market businesses backed by private equity sponsors. First-lien debt is its most common deal type, at 65% of the portfolio currently, but it has positions in second lien and subordinated debt, preferred stock, common stock and net lease deals. Its portfolio is 124 companies wide right now, and it uses a “defensive growth” strategy, with a focus on investing in strong businesses in acyclical sectors. New Mountain bounced off the COVID bear-market bottom much like other BDCs. But when the industry caught a second wind in 2024, NMFC was largely left behind. Shares are down about 3% even after accounting for its massive yield, which helps to explain its wide discount to NAV. The problem is that NAV is declining too, including a big quarter-over-quarter dip of nearly 2% between the first and second quarters. NMFC suffered from markdowns on healthcare, consumer products, and ed-tech firm Edmentum. On the bright side, non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days) were stable, and its credit quality remains in decent shape. Moreover, the company has fee waivers and a dividend protection program to keep the high payout in place. But for that discount to NAV to be a bona fide deal, we’ll need to see better business performance. Kayne Anderson BDC (KBDC, 12.6% yield) is another BDC operating in the middle-market with a penchant for private equity-backed, first-lien loans. KBDC targets companies with between $10 million and $75 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and its 114 portfolio companies are largely concentrated in defensive, stable industries. This is an extremely fresh-faced BDC: It began operations in 2021 and went public in 2024. And while it has hardly come roaring out of the gate—its lifetime total return is 1 percentage point removed from the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD)—there are signs of a decent business here. Are there weaknesses? Yes. One small loan was added to the non-accrual list during Q2, bringing non-accruals to 2.2% of the total portfolio on a cost basis (up from 1.9% in Q1). And NAV declined by just less than 1%. But the company’s investments have been picking up in Q3, including a strategic $80 million investment into lower-middle-market credit manager SG Credit at an 11% cash fixed yield. It’s running a $100 million buyback program through May 2026. And part of the aforementioned NAV decline was a 10-cent special dividend—its third in as many quarters. (KBDC yields 10% based on its 40-cent-per-share regular quarterly dividend; specials bring that up to 12.6%.) Mach Natural Resources LP (MNR, 16.0% distribution) is in another big-income niche: master limited partnerships (MLPs). While they can be a pain come tax time because of their additional K-1 form, double-digit distributions can make them worth our time. MNR is a young MLP that formed in November 2017 and went public in late 2023. Its primary operations are in the Anadarko Basin, and it has additional assets in the Green River basin. More recently, it has expanded its reach to the San Juan and Permian basins. While many of its peers are oil-heavy, it has a higher natural-gas mix that in the most recent quarter represented just over half its production. It’s also an efficient operator and has a good track record of buying assets at low valuations. MLP valuations get far into the weeds, but a common-enough one is EV (enterprise value)/EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense). On that front, MNR trades at roughly 3.5 times this year’s EBITDAX estimates, which is a little more than half of the average among comparable MLPs. Just understand that while the distribution is sky-high, it’s also all over the place. That’s because MNR pays out variable distributions, which are based on cash available after its 50% reinvestment rate. MFA Financial (MFA, 14.4% yield) invests in residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and other real estate assets. It also originates and services business purpose loans (BPLs) through its Lima One Capital subsidiary. MFA has massively outperformed the mREIT industry throughout its publicly traded life, though shareholders are best advised to wear their seatbelts—it speed-runs peaks and valleys alike. Lima One, which MFA acquired in 2021, is heading in the right direction; Q2 origination, servicing and other fees were up 13% QoQ, and the subsidiary added 15 loan officers during the quarter. Delinquency trends aren’t nearly so clean-cut: In Q2, they declined on the residential whole loan portfolio and single-family rental loans, but increased in the single-family BPL portfolio. Distributable earnings (DE, a non-GAAP measure of profitability that MFA favors) are expected to drop significantly this year before rebounding in 2026. Until then, the dividend is expected to outpace DE—that’s hardly a comfortable position. On the flip side? The market doesn’t appear to be pricing in a cut, and in fact, MFA actually raised its dividend by about 3% earlier this year—its first hike since a 20% cut in 2022. But MFA is value-priced, at about 7 times 2026 earnings estimates and 73% of book. We can get a downright jaw-dropping dividend from Armour Residential REIT (ARR, 19.0% yield), which primarily invests in fixed-rate “agency” residential MBSs, which are those issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The value picture is a bit different from MFA, but it’s still cheap—ARR trades at about 90% of book, but also at just more than 4 times 2026 core EPS estimates. The question is: How deep must the discount be to ignore Armour’s past? Consider this: In December 2024, I wrote that “any prospective investors will have to overcome a significant mental hurdle: namely, Armour’s horrific dividend track record.” Armour has cut its payout seven times since 2015, and that reflects serious underperformance compared to the mREIT industry. It has continued to underperform since then, but it really detached from the mREIT group in August following a second-quarter miss on distributable EPS and net interest income. Book value per share dropped by 9%. If there’s any solace, it’s that the nearly 20% dividend remains well-covered. But even with that mammoth dividend, ARR has been historically incapable of delivering consistent positive total returns. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?

Time Published: 2025-09-07T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Title: Take the nuclear option: Let Mamdani win the mayoral race so NYC can start over from scratch

As alarm bells ring over the New York City mayoral race, an odd sentiment is starting to gain traction across the business community: Just give up. Just sit tight and let the ill-equipped Maoist Zohran Mamdani win in November. Let him unleash his creepy, dogmatic socialist policies on the masses to teach them valuable lessons — both economic and cultural — about wokeness and progressivism, and more broadly its stranglehold on the Democratic Party. I’m starting to agree. Let the city sink into the abyss. Let Mamdani’s policies force out business and prod more upper- and middle-class residents to flee. Let the city declare bankruptcy — which will happen if Mamdani gets his way. We can then start from scratch. Detroit did it and the last time I was there, its downtown was pristine. Plus, we’re headed there anyway, right? Why not expedite the process and teach people who think leftism works that it doesn’t — particularly when you chase out all the non-leftists who pay the bills. To be clear, New York City isn’t Detroit. Sure, there’s diversification, businesses moving operations to Texas and Florida, but for all the work-from-home doom-and-gloom talk about New York City real estate, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan is still headquartered in Midtown. Goldman Sachs remains on the West Side. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is in Hudson Yards. NYU Langone is here, built through the grit of legendary financier Ken Langone, with world prestige and a quality of care to match. (I can personally attest to the latter.) The best restaurants are here: Try getting a table at ­Elio’s, Sistina or Rao’s. It’s still a cultural mecca, the home of Broadway, The Met and some great museums. For all our issues, New York City with a GDP of around $1.3 trillion has an economy bigger than many countries. We are also saddled, of course, with an insane political class. Zohran Mamdani might be honest in his Marxism, maybe boyishly naive in explaining the benefits of government-run grocery stores that have failed everywhere they were tried. (See most recently Kansas City.) But in this state, he is no outlier. He is emblematic of one-party rule, a fellow traveler in New York’s leftist Democratic Party that has brainwashed voters into believing we need massive regulation that impedes business formation. Ditto for rent control that creates housing shortages, lax policing (do you really feel safe on the streets of Manhattan, particularly at night?), high taxes (the reason so many people are leaving) and a fracking ban that continues to deprive economically depressed upstate regions. Dems have ditched New York’s melting pot in favor of woke and hostile tribalism. The largest concentration of Jews outside Israel, right here in New York City, must now accept daily harassment over leftists’ warped interpretation of history. And we must embrace ­unions, like the clown car that runs the school system. Consider: Sleepy Joe Biden’s immigration policies opened the floodgates for millions of migrants to come to this country.

Never miss a story. Many settled here in New York City, were housed in fancy hotels, and yet since 2020 NYC has witnessed a net out-migration of around 400,000 people. Put another way, a city’s worth of taxpayers left and was replaced by the world’s poor who are tapping into the city’s generous welfare state. Operationally, Andrew Cuomo could be a good mayor. He knows how to run things on both the state and national level. Yet consider his ill-fated last years as governor: He was forced to cave to the left on every issue, banned fracking, raised taxes and couldn’t tame the size of government. Could Eric Adams stand up to those clowns if he were to win — and not drop out as people now believe he will? He hasn’t so far. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, the crime-fighting activist founder of the Guardian Angels, is tough as nails and, when you sit with him, very coherent on policy. Yet if through a stroke of divine intervention he were to be elected, he would be outnumbered 1,000 to 1. He needs the state Legislature to create reform on taxes and other issues, and that’s where the mini-Mamdanis reside. There and the New York City Council, which is a mini-politburo. That’s why I am now leaning ­toward the nuclear option. Let Mamdani win — and prove to New Yorkers and Americans once and for all that there’s a reason communism failed in the Soviet Union, and that the apparatchiks in China have embraced the free market to survive.

Title: Amazon has lots of software bugs with Kindle Updates

The latest Amazon Kindle software update, which includes all the new accessibility features, has been a resounding success. However, there are always a few bugs that need to be addressed. The 15.8.4 update causes the screen to flicker constantly, but this issue can be resolved with a reboot. Multiple popups appear, blank and without any text. Sideloaded books had invalid ASIN numbers, but this issue has been resolved with a new Calibre update issued on September 5th. The update also has errors with borrowing e-books from the Kindle Unlimited program. Many of the books that users want to download are not downloading properly. The only way to fix this issue is to factory reset the Kindle, which will obviously delete all your content, including sideloaded books. Obviously, users should not have to go to these great lengths to use their Kindle as they normally would. Software updates have been causing more problems for the past couple of years, causing more problems than they solve. This started in 2022 when Amazon switched its programming language from JavaScript to React Native. This happened right after the new home screen experience was rolled out. Instead of your library being on the home screen, it now features page after page of recommendations and Amazon trying to sell you more Kindle Books. Firmware updates have been steadily deteriorating after the programming change. Still, they reached a breaking point every year since Amazon conducted layoffs of Kindle executives, engineers, programmers, and the book recommendations team. Hundreds of people left during those years, and dozens more did so due to the increased workload, but their pay remained the same. A few people in the Kindle division told me last month that morale is at an all-time low and Amazon simply doesn’t really care about Fire Tablets, Kindles, and Fire TV boxes anymore.

What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level. Despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It may take a minute to get to grips with magic internet money, but once you see the scarcity, durability, and predictability, it somehow all falls into place. From Jamie Dimon to Donald Trump, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano summed it up best, against an image of some high-profile personalities, including Donald Trump, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell, who have changed their tune on the number-one coin. He said: “Eventually everyone understands bitcoin.” In the beginning, the idea of a decentralized digital currency was met with skepticism, derision, and sometimes outright hostility. Yet, as the years have passed, some of the world’s most influential voices from Wall Street to Washington have changed their tunes, making Bitcoin’s journey from a fringe obsession to a mainstream asset nothing short of historic. Take Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. In 2017, he called Bitcoin a “fraud,” threatened to fire employees who traded it, and warned of government crackdowns. Fast-forward to the present, JPMorgan offers Bitcoin exposure to clients and Dimon regularly attends crypto panels. He’s critical of specifics, but his institution is deeply entrenched in blockchain finance. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink went from calling Bitcoin “an index of money laundering” to overseeing the world’s largest asset manager issuing a Bitcoin ETF and publicly referring to it as “digital gold.” Fink’s pivot stunned markets and signaled a shift in how legacy finance regards the new digital economy. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, was also skeptical about crypto for years. Yet under his watch, the Fed now closely monitors Bitcoin, citing its relevance to global markets and even a “competitor to gold.” Donald Trump once dismissed Bitcoin as being highly volatile and based on thin air. But by 2024, Trump was reportedly courting crypto donors and acknowledging Bitcoin’s increasing significance, reflecting the asset’s growing political clout.

Stay connected via Michael Saylor, now synonymous with Bitcoin advocacy, wasn’t always a maximalist. Before 2020, Saylor publicly doubted Bitcoin’s longevity, calling its days “numbered” as far back as 2013. Now, his company MicroStrategy holds more BTC than any other publicly traded firm (over 636,000 coins) and Saylor has personally become its most famous evangelist. And Mark Cuban spent years calling Bitcoin no different from bananas and raising doubts about its utility. Today, he’s an active participant in the crypto and NFT ecosystems, holding Bitcoin and advising blockchain companies. In other words? Eventually, everyone understands Bitcoin. If the world’s biggest names can change their minds, so can entire governments. According to the Visual Capitalist, the United States is now the largest holder of Bitcoin, with China following closely. These holdings are often the result of law enforcement seizures or strategic mining, but the fact remains: global governments hold thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of bitcoins, quietly shifting from outright bans to accumulation and research. Bitcoin’s path to mainstream acceptance has been paved with resistance and then recognition. Whether driven by economic imperatives, technological curiosity, or simply the fear of missing out, figures like Jamie Dimon and Donald Trump have finally come to the same realization: Bitcoin is here, and it is inevitable; even governments now hold Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level, proving Pompliano right that, despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin.

Title: The Banks and the Unbanked: Blockchain’s Biggest Beneficiaries Sit at Both Ends of the Financial Spectrum

Capital markets are in flux. As evolving monetary policy casts a spotlight on a fragmented global economy, the stability of infrastructure for borderless transactions with digital assets stands out as a superior alternative to the traditional system. Blockchain is a viable solution to many of today’s financial challenges. Uniquely, its clearest beneficiaries are two distinctly different groups: financial institutions and the 1.4 billion people who are unbanked. The former gains next-generation speed and scalability while the latter benefits from newfound accessibility and equity. Our charge as builders of this industry, if we want to actualize blockchain’s full potential, is to account for the needs of both. While the financially marginalized have long sought solutions in bleeding-edge tech, the legacy world is just beginning to get the appeal. "We have to be thinking about how we leverage [blockchain] in our environment," said Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson recently, discussing how costs in asset management are up 80% in the last decade, while revenues are down 15%. Franklin Templeton's breakthrough illustrates this institutional awakening. Their first-ever tokenized money market fund reduces transaction costs from $1 to less than a penny – for an institution managing $1.7 trillion, the efficiency gains are transformative. But this institutional adoption does more than cut costs; it validates the infrastructure that can serve both boardrooms and the billions still excluded from traditional finance. The same blockchain rails enabling Franklin Templeton's efficiency gains can deliver $50 remittances from Dubai to the Philippines in seconds rather than several business days. The technology removes friction, whether you're settling $100 million in tokenized assets or sending $100 to family abroad. Major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan are proving blockchain's institutional viability at unprecedented scale. Aid organizations, such as the United Nations Refugee Agency, are simultaneously demonstrating its humanitarian potential, distributing assistance directly to those in need without traditional intermediaries. These parallel developments reflect blockchain's unique capacity to serve both efficiency and equity. The institutional momentum creates crucial infrastructure benefits for everyone. When major financial players invest in blockchain networks, they strengthen the rails that underbanked populations can also access. When regulatory frameworks emerge to support institutional adoption, they create legal clarity that benefits all users. Consider the numbers that drive both institutional interest and human need. Global transaction banking generates nearly $1.4 trillion in annual revenue, yet operational inefficiencies cost an estimated 8-10% of that revenue. For institutions, blockchain technology offers clear solutions to these challenges. For the unbanked, the stakes are different but equally compelling. Remittances – which exceeded $900 billion globally in 2024 – carry average fees of 6.62% worldwide, with some corridors reaching 10% or more. Working families lose billions annually to these costs. When a domestic worker sends $500 home, losing $50 to fees represents not inefficiency but genuine hardship. The convergence becomes clear: the same technology solving institutional inefficiencies can address human exclusion from the financial system. Blockchain networks processing transactions for fractions of a penny with 3-5 second settlement times serve both institutional treasuries and individual remittances equally well. Real-world stress tests prove blockchain's dual utility. In Argentina, where inflation reached 236.7% by late 2024, both institutions and individuals are embracing digital assets out of necessity. Data shows 61.8% of Argentina's crypto transactions now involve stablecoins — not as speculation, but as economic survival tools preserving purchasing power against peso devaluation. This crisis-driven adoption reveals blockchain's fundamental value proposition: removing dependence on fragile intermediaries and national monetary systems. Whether you're a fund manager hedging institutional exposure or a family protecting savings, the infrastructure provides the same essential service: stable, borderless value transfer. The infrastructure exists. Modern blockchain networks have processed tens of billions of operations, serving millions of accounts worldwide. The technology handles institutional scale while remaining accessible to individual users. But actualizing blockchain's full potential requires intentional design for both audiences. This means building interfaces sophisticated enough for institutional treasury management yet simple enough for first-time users. It means creating compliance frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving accessibility for underserved populations. Success requires partnerships spanning both worlds – working with established financial institutions to build robust infrastructure while partnering with mobile money operators, community organizations, and fintech companies serving underbanked populations. The goal isn't choosing between efficiency and equity, but achieving both simultaneously. Blockchain's unique promise lies precisely in its ability to serve these seemingly different constituencies with the same fundamental infrastructure. The networks enabling pension funds to tokenize assets can help farmers access credit. The rails facilitating institutional settlement can deliver humanitarian aid directly to refugees. As builders, our responsibility extends beyond technological capability to purposeful implementation. We must ensure that institutional adoption strengthens rather than supplants financial inclusion efforts. We must design systems that leverage institutional resources to extend access rather than create new barriers. The infrastructure for borderless, frictionless value transfer is ready. The regulatory frameworks are evolving. The institutional adoption is accelerating. Our success will be measured not just by efficiency gains in existing systems, but by how many people we bring into economic participation for the first time. The choice we make today determines whether blockchain becomes another tool serving the already-served or the bridge finally connecting everyone to the global economy. Both institutions and the unbanked are counting on us to get this right.

Title: Perfect Competition Will Crush AI Profits
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/perfect-competition-will-crush-ai-profits/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T14:30:01Z
Full Content:
By Dan Amoss PostedSeptember 6, 2025 Today’s AI investment craze suffers from the same flawed assumptions that sparked past bubbles. Without a course correction, the U.S. economy faces a self-inflicted bust. In the mid-2000s, Wall Street’s best and brightest were packaging subprime loans into complex securities and assuring the world they were safe. Regulators nodded. Rating agencies blessed them. Investors snapped them up. Few asked the obvious question: What if the assumptions behind these instruments are wrong? Today, a similar blind spot is spreading through the economy – not through mortgages, but through artificial intelligence (AI). Everyone from Big Tech giants to startup founders, institutional investors, and Washington policymakers is convinced that artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology, and that big capital expenditures (capex) today will lead to countless industrywide profits in the future. But there’s a problem: Demand in value-added, real-world applications is unlikely to be large enough to justify all this investment. The demand that AI promoters constantly highlight is drawn from Large language model (LLM) training sessions and queries – neither of which is associated with much sustainable, real-world revenue. Much of the revenue being booked in this ecosystem ultimately comes from a limited pool of venture capital (VC) funds. A recent story from The Information estimated that these LLM companies generate roughly $18.5 billion in annualized revenue. Ironically, The Information was trying to rebut the claims from an MIT Media Lab report that concluded 95% of businesses are seeing no return on AI pilot projects. It’s ironic because $18.5 billion in annualized revenue is peanuts relative to the astonishingly large amount of capital poured into these companies. The revenue streams in the chart above are also not very valuable because LLM companies are not showing positive operating leverage. Plenty of evidence indicates that costs scale alongside revenue at LLM companies. Heavy users burn lots of electricity and shorten Nvidia chips’ lives in their usage of the models. And free users will just switch to a competing LLM if ever required to pay a subscription fee. Today’s AI investment mania has two key blind spots: the fallacy of composition and adverse selection. Let’s break those down. The fallacy of composition is the mistaken belief that what’s true for one player is true for all. If one company like Microsoft makes money selling AI products, then investors assume the entire AI sector will do the same. But that’s not how competitive markets work. In fact, success in a competitive market often comes at the expense of rivals. There can be winners, but not everyone can win. This fallacy infected the telecom boom of the late 1990s. Just because one broadband provider had profitable demand didn’t mean every fiber-optic network was worth building. Billions were spent laying cables that no one would use for another decade. Then there’s adverse selection. In insurance, this happens when sick people are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people, leading to losses for the insurer that doesn’t attract enough healthy customers. In AI, something similar is unfolding: the heaviest users of AI chatbots and tools – those demanding the most computing resources – are often not paying enough in subscription fees to cover their costs to the LLM provider. The casual users, who make up the vast majority, may never convert to paying customers. This undermines the very business model these companies are betting on. What happens when the market discovers this? You get a doom loop: companies overspend on infrastructure, hoping for future demand that never materializes, while investors keep piling in – until someone finally notices the emperor is minimally clothed. There’s a popular narrative that the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) will capture most of the economic value created by AI. But history suggests otherwise. In past tech revolutions, the biggest winners weren’t always the biggest companies. The advent of the internet helped millions of small and mid-sized businesses gain customers and compete globally. Low-cost e-commerce tools like Shopify and advertising platforms like Google and Facebook gave them the reach they never had before. Similarly, it’s possible that AI’s biggest beneficiaries won’t be the firms building the models, but the dentists, restaurant owners, and local manufacturers who use those tools to accelerate mundane processes and serve customers better. The irony? While these SMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) benefit, the AI platforms enabling them may struggle to get paid. If Google’s new Veo video model helps a dentist craft a great local ad, will that dentist pay Google more? One of the most dangerous assumptions in AI capex is that these platforms will enjoy pricing power – meaning they can charge enough to cover their costs and then some. But look closely, and this assumption crumbles. The AI chatbot market looks a lot like perfect competition, a textbook term for markets where many providers offer nearly identical products, and prices fall toward the cost of production. Unlike the broadband boom of the 2000s, where companies had to rip up streets to lay wires and customers had few broadband alternatives, switching from one AI model to another takes a few clicks. If you’re a free user of ChatGPT, and it suddenly costs $20 a month to use it at all, but Claude or Gemini is free and just as good, nothing is stopping you from switching. That’s the nightmare scenario for the AI providers: they’ve built massive infrastructure assuming recurring subscription revenue, but the customer base may have no loyalty and little willingness to pay. It’s like investing billions into oil wells only to find out your oil sells for $10 a barrel instead of $70. In a healthy economy, production and consumption communicate constantly. If a company builds something useful, customers respond by buying it. If they overbuild, inventories pile up and prices fall, sending a signal to slow down. AI infrastructure, by contrast, is being built largely on faith. Companies are scaling up compute power without clear signs of sustainable demand. Unlike oil and gas, where prices adjust second-by-second, AI companies operate in a fog. They release tools, collect usage stats, and hope that paid conversions will follow. But hope is not a business model. In fact, today’s AI leaders resemble 2006-era banks more than healthy, feedback-driven enterprises. They’re in an unhealthy relationship with venture capital (VC) firms that need higher and higher valuation “marks” to justify their fees. VC firms don’t want transparency about customer conversion rates, churn, or operating losses that scale with revenue. That would kill the narrative before the VCs can cash out in IPOs to the public market. Meanwhile, China is asking a much more grounded question: How can we use AI to make real-world industries more efficient? Companies like DeepSeek are building AI tools designed to solve narrow problems in energy, logistics, and manufacturing. That’s closer to how the human brain works – selectively activating regions based on the task at hand. And it’s proving to be more effective than trying to create superintelligence in a box. While U.S. Big Tech chases lofty visions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – often undefined and possibly unachievable – China is deploying AI in practical ways that produce results. To compete, the U.S. must start asking more rigorous questions: What is AI actually for? Who pays for it? And how does it improve the lives of average Americans? If there’s one place where AI hype is meeting hard reality, it’s software engineering. Veteran developer Carl Brown, in an interview with Ed Zitron, shredded the idea that large language models (LLMs) will replace human coders anytime soon. He explained how writing code is only a small part of the job. The real work is long-term thinking, fixing bugs, and figuring out what the software should do. AI tools can crank out lines of code fast. But they often do it sloppily, duplicating functions and ignoring best practices. The result is software that’s harder to maintain, easier to hack, and more prone to crashing. Brown compared AI code to “vibe coding,” which is typing something into a chatbot and hoping it works. That might be fine for a one-time prototype, but it’s a recipe for disaster in a software program that’s meant to last. Worse still, managers – who assume AI is miraculous because they hear about it so much on CNBC – don’t understand programming. These managers are using AI to justify layoffs or to demand unrealistic productivity increases from their teams. This may create a generation of junior engineers who never learn to code properly because they’re relying on tools that don’t understand the long game of software development. It’s often claimed that software is the most natural market for AI to disrupt. However, Carl Brown’s view, plus dozens of other examples, confirm that in real-world stress tests, AI misses too many things, or hallucinates too often, to be considered a revolutionary technology trend. So, in the months ahead, we’re likely to see more hints that Big Tech companies are tapping the brakes on Nvidia chip orders. They’ll do this to avoid an accelerating decline in their free cash flows – a trend that’s already looking scary. For example, see this projection from BofA Global Research. It shows capital spending as a percentage of operating cash flow at the companies building hyperscale data centers. A recession or a bust in venture capital funding for AI LLM companies (like OpenAI) could drive operating cash flow lower. That would make the BofA chart surge higher than they project in the dotted lines. And higher capex relative to cash flow means free cash flow would dive toward zero. To avoid that scenario, hyperscale data center operators would cut AI chip orders. Editor’s note: Members of Strategic Intelligence Pro can access Dan’s full report, including the stock pick, here.

September 06, 2025 10:12 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Larry Fink Ascends to WEF Throne: BlackRock’s Puppet Master Takes Command of the Globalist Enslavement Machine

Editor Empire Whatfinger In a chilling development that exposes the deepening tentacles of the globalist elite, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has elevated BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to the position of interim co-chairman of its board, alongside André Hoffmann of Roche. This move, announced on August 15, 2025, comes hot on the heels of an internal investigation that conveniently cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of any “material wrongdoing” despite swirling allegations of financial and ethical misconduct. Fink, the architect of BlackRock’s $11 trillion empire that dominates everything from housing markets to corporate boardrooms, now sits at the helm of an organization long accused of plotting humanity’s subjugation under the guise of “sustainable development” and the infamous “Great Reset.” For years, patriots and truth-seekers have warned about the WEF’s sinister agenda: a technocratic dystopia where the masses own nothing, eat bugs, and live as digital serfs in smart cities monitored by AI overlords. Reminder – Larry Fink admits the quiet part out loud: “You have to force behaviors.” BlackRock’s CEO—WEF darling & architect of the ESG regime—spells out the real agenda: Social engineering by corporate coercion. No “incremental change.” No organic diversity. Just top-down mandates, dictating who gets hired, promoted, or funded based on race, gender, & ideological compliance. This isn’t “stakeholder capitalism.” It’s elite-driven control. And if you resist? You’ll “be impacted.” The organization’s ties to depopulation schemes—echoing the eerie Georgia Guidestones’ call for reducing the world’s population to a mere 500 million—have fueled conspiracies that the elite view billions of us as expendable “useless eaters.” Now, with Fink in charge, these fears are no longer fringe theories but a glaring reality. As one X user aptly put it, “The evil of the WEF that wants all of mankind enslaved, and reduced to 500 million people world-wide, guess who is now their leader? BlackRock’s Larry Fink.” Klaus Schwab’s reign at the WEF has been a masterclass in elite manipulation. Founded in 1971, the Davos cabal has masqueraded as a “platform for public-private cooperation” while pushing policies that erode national sovereignty and empower unelected bureaucrats. Schwab’s “stakeholder capitalism”—a euphemism for corporate fascism—has been championed by figures like Fink, who led the U.S. Business Roundtable in 2019 to redefine corporate purpose around this very ideology. But beneath the polished speeches lies a darker truth: allegations of harassment, financial impropriety, and a toxic culture that led to Schwab’s ousting. The WEF’s board, stacked with globalist heavyweights like Al Gore, Christine Lagarde, and now Fink himself, held an emergency meeting to whitewash these claims, declaring only “minor irregularities.” Even Schwab’s wife Hilde was implicated, yet the elite protect their own, ensuring the agenda marches on uninterrupted. Fink’s ascension is no accident; it’s the culmination of BlackRock’s insidious influence. As CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Fink controls stakes in virtually every major corporation, wielding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria as a weapon to enforce woke policies and climate hysteria. Critics have blasted ESG as a “social credit system for corporations,” forcing companies to prioritize globalist goals over American interests. BlackRock’s push into housing markets, buying up single-family homes en masse, aligns perfectly with the WEF’s “you’ll own nothing and be happy” mantra—renting from corporate overlords while the elite hoard wealth. And let’s not forget Fink’s cozy ties to governments: during the COVID-19 scam, BlackRock advised central banks on bailouts, facilitating the greatest wealth transfer in history from Main Street to Wall Street. The depopulation angle is where the conspiracy turns truly diabolical. Fink has openly mused about “substituting humans for machines” in countries with declining populations, a chilling endorsement of automation that renders billions obsolete.This dovetails with WEF-linked narratives on “decarbonization requiring depopulation,” where climate zealots like Bill Gates and the elite push for fewer people to “save the planet.” The Great Reset, unveiled in 2020, isn’t about recovery—it’s a blueprint for control, leveraging pandemics, climate scares, and economic chaos to impose digital IDs, CBDCs, and universal basic income as chains on the masses. Fink’s BlackRock has funneled billions into “green” initiatives, profiting from the destruction of fossil fuels while ordinary folks face skyrocketing energy costs. Conspiratorial voices have long connected the dots: BlackRock’s infiltration of governments, from advising Zelenskyy on Ukraine’s reconstruction to schmoozing with leftist leaders like UK’s Keir Starmer and Australia’s Anthony Albanese. Starmer, a WEF acolyte, has slashed winter fuel payments for millions while releasing prisoners early—policies that reek of Agenda 2030’s disdain for the working class. In Canada, WEF darling Mark Carney eyes the premiership, promising more climate tyranny and CBDCs. These puppets serve Fink’s vision: a world where BlackRock owns the assets, the WEF sets the rules, and humanity is culled to sustainable levels. Patriots are sounding the alarm. One X post warns, “They are bringing out the big guns…. They don’t think the patriots will try to bring the WEF down with the head of world investments as their leader.” Another declares the WEF a “terrorist organization,” echoing calls to classify it as such. Fink’s critics point to his “forced behavior” tactics, using finance to alter government policies without democratic accountability. Even in the face of backlash—states like Florida ditching BlackRock over ESG extremism—Fink doubles down, complaining that criticism has become “personal and ugly.” The WEF’s “Young Global Leaders” program has churned out compliant tyrants like Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, all marching to the tune of Fink’s orchestra. With Fink now co-chairing, expect accelerated pushes for bio-engineering humans to be allergic to meat, mandatory vaccines, and surveillance states—all in the name of “climate action.” As one truth-seeker notes, “Billionaire Larry Fink is an extinctionist, an eugenicist and a misanthrope like Bill Gates… They share a desire to reduce the world population from around 8 Billion down to 500 million.” This isn’t just about economics; it’s spiritual warfare against freedom-loving people. The elite’s blueprint—exposed in leaks and admissions—aims to enslave us through debt, dependency, and division. But resistance is growing. From Trump supporters to everyday Americans, the call is clear: dismantle the WEF, audit BlackRock, and reclaim sovereignty. As Fink and his cronies plot in Davos shadows, patriots must unite to expose and defeat this cabal before it’s too late. The fight for humanity’s soul is on—will you own nothing, or own the truth?

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Deutsche Bank analysts have been watching Amazon Prime, it seems. Specifically, the “breakout” show of the summer, “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” In the AI sphere, analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan wrote, it was the summer AI “turned ugly,” with several emerging themes that will set the course for the final quarter of the year. Paramount among them: The rising fear over whether AI has driven Big Tech stocks into the kind of frothy territory that precedes a sharp drop. The AI news cycle of the summer captured themes including the challenge of starting a career, the importance of technology in the China/U.S. trade war, and mounting anxiety about the impact of the technology. But in terms of finance and investing, Deutsche Bank sees markets “on edge” and hoping for a soft landing amid bubble fears. In part, it blames tech CEOs for egging on the market with overpromises, leading to inflated hopes and dreams, many spurred on by tech leaders’ overpromises. It also sees a major impact from the venture capital space, boosting startups’ valuations, and from the lawyers who are very busy filing lawsuits for all kinds of AI players. It’s ugly out there. But the market is actually “more sober” in many ways than the situation from the late 1990s, the German bank argues. Still, Wall Street is not Main Street, and Deutsche Bank notes troubling math about the data centers sprouting up on the outskirts of your town. Specifically, the bank flags a back-of-the-envelope analysis from hedge fund Praetorian Capital that suggests hyperscalers’ massive data center investments could be setting up the market for negative returns, echoing past cycles of “capital destruction.” AI has captured the market’s imagination, with Cox and Abrudan noting, “it’s clear there is a lot of hype.” Web searches for AI are 10 times as high as they ever were for crypto, the bank said, citing Google Trends data, while it also finds that S&P 500 companies mentioned “AI” over 3,300 times in their earnings calls this past quarter. Stock valuations overall have soared alongside the “Magnificent Seven” tech firms, which collectively comprise a third of the S&P 500’s market cap. (The most magnificent: Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company at a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.) Yet Deutsche Bank points out that today’s top tech players have healthier balance sheets and more resilient business models than the high flyers of the dotcom era. By most ratios, the bank said, valuations “still look more sober than those for hot stocks at the height of the dot-com bubble,” when the Nasdaq more than tripled in less than 18 months to March 2000, then lost 75% of its value by late 2002. By price-to-earnings ratio, Alphabet and Meta are in the mid-20x range, while Amazon and Microsoft trade in the mid-30x range. By comparison, Cisco surpassed 200x during the dotcom bubble, and even Microsoft reached 80x. Nvidia is “only” 50x, Deutsche Bank noted. Despite the relative restraint in share prices, AI’s real risk may be lurking away from its stock-market valuations, in the economics of its infrastructure. Deutsche Bank cites a blog post by Praetorian Capital “that has been doing the rounds.” The post in “Kuppy’s Korner,” named for the fund’s CEO Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman, estimates that hyperscalers’ total data-center spending for 2025 could hit $400 billion, and the bank notes that is roughly the size of the GDP of Malaysia or Egypt. The problem, according to the hedge fund, is that the data centers will depreciate by roughly $40 billion per year, while they currently generate no more than $20 billion of annual revenue. How is that supposed to work? “Now, remember, revenue today is running at $15 to $20 billion,” the blog post says, explaining that revenue needs to grow at least tenfold just to cover the depreciation. Even assuming future margins rise to 25%, the blog post estimates that the sector would require a stunning $160 billion in annual revenue from the AI powered by those data centers just to break even on depreciation—and nearly $480 billion to deliver a modest 20% return on invested capital. For context, even giants like Netflix and Microsoft Office 365 at their peaks brought in less than a fraction of that figure. Even at that level, “you’d need $480 billion of AI revenue to hit your target return … $480 billion is a LOT of revenue for guys like me who don’t even pay a monthly fee today for the product.” Going from $20 billion to $480 billion could take a long time, if ever, is the implication, and sometime before the big AI platforms reach those levels, their earnings, and presumably their shares, could take a hit. Deutsche Bank itself isn’t as pessimistic. The bank notes that the data-center buildout is producing a greatly reduced cost for each use of an AI model, as startups are reaching “meaningful scale in cloud consumption.” Also, consumer AI such as ChatGPT and Gemini is growing fast, with OpenAI saying in August that ChatGPT had over 700 million weekly users, plus 5 million paying business users, up from 3 million three months earlier. The cost to query an AI model (subsidized by the venture capital sector, to be sure) has fallen by around 99.7% in the two years since the launch of ChatGPT and is still headed downward. Praetorian Capital draws two historical parallels to the current situation: the dotcom era’s fiber buildout, which led to the bankruptcy of Global Crossing, and the more recent capital bust of shale oil. In each case, the underlying technology is real and transformative—but overzealous spending with little regard for returns could leave investors holding the bag if progress stalls. The “arms race” mentality now gripping the hyperscalers’ massive capex buildout mirrors the capital intensity of those past crises, and as Praetorian notes, “even the MAG7 will not be immune” if shareholder patience runs out. Per Kuppy’s Korner, “the megacap tech names are forced to lever up to keep buying chips, after having outrun their own cash flows; or they give up on the arms race, writing off the past few years of capex … Like many things in finance, it’s all pretty obvious where this will end up, it’s the timing that’s the hard part.” This cycle, Deutsche Bank argues, is being sustained by robust earnings and more conservative valuations than the dotcom era, but “periodic corrections are welcome, releasing some steam from the system and guarding against complacency.” If revenue growth fails to keep up with depreciation and replacement needs, investors may force a harsh reckoning—one characterized not by spectacular innovation but by a slow realization of negative returns. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Analyst Forecasts XRP To Stage Amazon-Like Rally To $200

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP has drawn plenty of comparisons over the past few months, but one analyst believes the best way to understand its future is to look at Amazon’s past. Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade. Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

Title: Volatility Is Back, And This 7.8% CEF Is Here To Get Us Through It

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. A market on a precipice. That’s the vibe around stocks right now, and I’m guessing you’ve felt it, too. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is up 14% in the past year, a very solid performance (and for the record, I see more gains ahead). Yet volatility has returned, and it feels like we could be on the verge of another selloff. So what do we do right now? We’re going to look at a closed-end fund (CEF) that profits from short-term volatility. In fact, this one harnesses the energy that choppy markets throw off and “converts” it to a hefty dividend stream. The result? This CEF takes the low-yielding (mainly) tech stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (average yield: 0.5%) and bumps that up to a solid 7.8% dividend. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Before we go further, let me touch on why I feel that, over the long term, more gains are ahead for US stocks. For one, the value of long-term bonds has dropped, showing that investors still have a healthy appetite for risk, selling, as they are, some of the safest investments out there. Stocks (particularly tech stocks) are the obvious destination for these investors. At the same time, the stock market is backed up by the US economy’s continued strong growth. What’s important is what’s going on after the effects of inflation. In real terms, US GDP growth in 2025 has been around 2% on a year-over-year basis. It’s a solid clip that’s topped expectations, with many economists predicting less than 1% growth. Then there’s the most current economic estimate we have, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator, which shows growth accelerating, spiking to over 3% in the third quarter. What’s behind this expansion? AI, for one: Investments in the tech will hit $400 billion this year, up 60% from 2024—and they’re still growing fast. It’s clear that AI, whatever we may think about it, is a boon to the economy, and the momentum is not letting up. Of course, in the short term, investors will fret, which is why any downturns are buying opportunities. But what can we do now, with stocks having tempered their recent gains and before we see the next significant drop? This is where that CEF I mentioned earlier comes in: It sells call options, or the right for buyers to purchase its holdings at a fixed price and a fixed date in the future. It then uses that cash to fuel its 7.8% payout. It’s a nice dividend play while we wait for the next selloff to put stocks—and the “pure” equity-focused CEFs I prefer for the long run—back on sale. Tech stocks are perfect for covered-call selling because they’re sensitive to the kinds of panic selloffs we’re likely to see as AI optimism ebbs and flows, with an ebbing of sentiment seemingly around the corner. (For the record, though, in the long run, I see Big Tech’s AI investments as likely to be worth it—the productivity gains the technology offers are just too great.) The go-to covered-call fund here is the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Since it owns the NASDAQ 100, its portfolio is a who’s-who of companies driving the AI boom. NVIDIA (NVDA) is its biggest holding, at nearly 10% of the portfolio, followed by Microsoft (MSFT). The NASDAQ is up 90% over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up just 63%, showing how much money there is to be made in investing in tech over the long term. But as you’ve no doubt noticed, the NASDAQ’s volatility is always higher, and can spike in times of panic, like what we saw during the April “tariff tantrum.” In short: Buying the NASDAQ is great, but you need nerves of steel while you hold it. That’s where QQQX comes in, “translating” that volatility into a regular quarterly dividend that gives investors that 7.8% income stream. That by itself is why QQQX is a strong candidate when market jitters push up volatility. But there’s another: QQQX is especially cheap now. Over the last decade, QQQX has had an average discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of 1.7%. It’s now 7.7%, and it was even lower in the last few months, averaging about 10% throughout 2024 and the first few months of this year. Why is it a bit narrower now? Because investors are realizing that QQQX’s investments continue to appreciate, as does its ability to boost dividends. Those strengths should help its discount to move toward par, where it traded in the 2010s. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Serious U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Issued As Bitcoin Mounts $24 Trillion Gold Price Challenge

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged this year, topping $124,000 per bitcoin in August as a growing crisis at the Federal Reserve takes a surprising turn. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year—with some now predicting bitcoin is on the brink of a $84 trillion shock—with the massive $4 trillion rally causing some of the world’s biggest celebrities to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Now, as the new crypto gold rush forges what could be the new “Rockefellers or Rothschilds,” Goldman Sachs analysts have warned the U.S. dollar’s global reserve-currency status could be eaten away by gold—just as bitcoin comes for its safe-haven asset crown. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman analysts including Samantha Dart wrote in a note to clients seen by Bloomberg. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust.” Trump has been ramping up his war of words against the Federal Reserve this year, attacking Fed chair Jerome Powell as economists warn of a looming dollar disaster. Trump has threatened to fire Powell and tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook, sparking fears over the future of the Fed’s independence from the White House. Dart predicted the gold price could surge to $5,000 an ounce if U.S. president Donald Trump’s war on the Fed causes global investors to lose confidence in bonds, stocks, and the dollar, with only a small shift from the massive Treasuries market into bullion enough to trigger outsized gains. “As a result, gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space," Dart wrote, adding, “we estimate that if 1% of the privately owned U.S. Treasury market were to flow into gold, the gold price would rise to nearly $5,000/[troy ounce], assuming everything else constant." Gold’s rally this year, climbing from $2,500 an ounce 12 months ago to $3,600 today and giving gold a $24 trillion market capitalization, has come alongside a bitcoin price boom that’s sent bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold, to record highs. “[Bitcoin] sits at the intersection of gold and equities—an emerging store of value that thrives when liquidity rotates into risk,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments following the latest U.S. jobs report coming in below expectations, setting up the Federal Reserve to cut rates later this month as U.S. president Donald Trump has called for. “With $7.2 trillion in money market funds likely to move as yields fall, bitcoin offers the ultimate hybrid profile: digital gold for safety, and asymmetric upside as a risk-on asset. Seasonality also strengthens the setup, with the fourth quarter historically bitcoin’s strongest quarter—the asset has only seen two negative Octobers in its entire history— suggesting that as liquidity returns, buying pressure could accelerate into year-end.” Technical analysis comparing bitcoin to gold by Coindesk shows the bitcoin price could be headed for “a potential breakout by late in the fourth quarter or early next year.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Meanwhile, the World Gold Council is developing a digitalized form of gold as fears grow that bitcoin could replace it as the world's safe-haven asset. "We are trying to standardise that digital layer of gold, such that the various financial products used in other markets can be used in the gold market going forward,” David Tait, a former banker and chief executive of the World Gold Council, an industry body representing gold miners, told the Financial Times. “My goal is that many asset managers around the world will suddenly look at it differently." Fears that bitcoin could overtake gold among investors seeking exposure to a scarce, non-governmental or corporate asset have been heightened by the rapid rise of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now hold almost as much in assets under management (AUM) as gold ETFs despite spot bitcoin ETFs only being launched at the beginning of 2024. "How long before AUM in 'digital gold’ ETFs surpasses physical? Bitcoin ETF assets are closing in on gold ETF assets," financial markets research company Bespoke’s account posted to X, pointing to data that showed they are now worth $150 billion and $180 billion, respectively.

Title: Musk holds hostage history’s biggest meme stock delusion
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/06/elon-musk-1-trillion-compensation-pay-package-tesla-shareholders-governance/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party — considered a Nazi apologist group — and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Title: Ireland vs Hungary – Match preview and team news

Ireland and Hungary go head-to-head in a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier in Dublin on Saturday evening. Both sides will be searching for a positive start to their Group F campaign, in an intriguing group that also contains Portugal and Armenia. Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrímsson has named a 23-man squad for the games against Hungary and Armenia, although there are some notable absences. Captain Seamus Coleman has been left out after being an unused substitute in Everton’s opening three Premier League matches this season. The experienced defender has not featured since withdrawing from the June friendlies through injury. Gavin Bazunu and Chiedozie Ogbene return to the squad after lengthy injury layoffs. Bazunu has recovered from knee surgery to reclaim his place at Southampton, while Ogbene is back for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in October 2024. Celtic defender Liam Scales is available to play after rolling his ankle against Rangers at the weekend, while Johnny Kenny has come in as attacking cover after Troy Parrott pulled out of the squad. Nathan Collins will captain the side in Coleman’s absence, with Caoimhín Kelleher providing experience in goal after his move from Liverpool to Brentford. However, Robbie Brady, Callum O’Dowda and Festy Ebosele all miss out through injury. Read – The mind-blowing numbers behind record-breaking transfer window Hungary manager Marco Rossi has named a larger-than-usual 27-man squad, including four potential debutants. The Italian coach has emphasised selecting players in good form, with Barna Tóth, Rajmund Molnár, Dániel Lukács and Bence Ötvös all earning their first call-ups. Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai will captain the side, with the 24-year-old having been Hungary’s talisman since taking over the armband in November 2022. However, there are concerns over Hungary’s over-reliance on their skipper, with the team struggling when he is marked out of games. Milos Kerkez, Willi Orbán and András Schäfer provide experience in the squad, while striker Barnabás Varga remains a key attacking threat. Rossi has stressed the importance of starting the campaign well against a physical Irish side. Read – The biggest Champions League omissions as squad lists announced Hallgrímsson’s side have shown gradual improvement since replacing Stephen Kenny in the hot seat last year. They secured their League B status in the UEFA Nations League, defeating Bulgaria 4-2 on aggregate in a relegation playoff. Their most recent friendlies both ended in stalemates against Senegal (1-1) and Luxembourg (0-0), highlighting their struggles in front of goal. Marco Rossi’s team endured a difficult Nations League campaign, finishing bottom of Group A3. They were relegated after losing 6-1 on aggregate to Turkey in the promotion/relegation playoffs. Recent friendlies brought mixed results, with a 2-1 win over Azerbaijan and a 0-2 defeat to Sweden.

Title: Ether ETFs see $788M in outflows: what’s going on?

US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw four straight days of net outflows during the shortened trading week following Labor Day, reversing some of the momentum that had built up in August. The funds shed a total of $787.6 million between Tuesday and Friday, with the sharpest move on Friday when $446.8 million exited the products, according to data from Farside. Over the same period, Bitcoin ETFs saw $250.3 million in net inflows. The weekly reversal comes after a strong August for Ether ETFs, which attracted $3.87 billion in inflows. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, recorded $751 million in outflows during the month. Despite the recent weakness, several market participants remain bullish on Ether’s outlook. On Wednesday, BitMine chairman Tom Lee reiterated his forecast that ETH could eventually reach $60,000. Speaking on the Medici Presents: Level Up podcast, he said Wall Street’s growing interest in the token could become a “1971 moment” for the asset, a reference to the US ending the gold standard and ushering in a new financial era. BitMine is the largest Ether treasury company, holding about $8.04 billion worth of ETH, according to data from StrategicETHReserve. Collectively, Ether treasury companies now control 2.97% of the token’s circulating supply, valued at $15.49 billion at the time of publication. Supporting that outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment noted that large Ether holders have steadily increased their positions. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH — worth between $4.31 million and $430.63 million — have grown their balances by 14% since April, when ETH touched yearly lows. “In exactly 5 months, they have added 14.0% more coins,” Santiment said in a post on X. The firm suggested that the accumulation trend could provide underlying support for the asset even as ETF flows fluctuate. Ether traded at $4,313 on Saturday, while Bitcoin stood at $110,238. The diverging ETF flows highlight shifting sentiment between the two largest cryptocurrencies as traders weigh the impact of macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption. While short-term flows have turned negative, Ether’s strong August performance and continued interest from institutional players suggest that investors remain divided on whether the latest moves mark a pause or the start of a broader rotation back into Bitcoin.

Resources from this episode: Ben Greenfield [00:00:00]: My name is Ben Greenfield, and on this episode of the Boundless Life podcast. Jordan Rubin [00:00:04]: I immediately realized this isn't leaves that the Bible is talking about. This specifically is a leaf from a fruit tree. And as soon as that passage of scripture came out of the app into my ears, I felt God say with as audible of a voice as I have ever heard, this is it. Ben Greenfield [00:00:27]: Welcome to the Boundless Life with me, your host, Ben Greenfield, personal trainer, exercise physiologist, and nutritionist. And I'm passionate about helping you discover unparalleled levels of health, fitness, longevity, and beyond. Ben Greenfield [00:00:48]: Right before I started recording, I was telling my podcast guest that the family and I like to memorize Bible verses, and we're working through Psalms right now. Psalm 139, he said they have a psalm. He and his family have a psalm that they recite. I think you said, Jordan, every night at dinner. Jordan Rubin [00:01:06]: Every night when we're together, Ben, which is not every night, but we try to do it, yes. Ben Greenfield [00:01:11]: And you said it's a Psalm of protection. Jordan Rubin [00:01:15]: Yes, Psalm 91. And there have been at least three books written about those who recite Psalm 91 and avoiding major catastrophes when others around them were dying. So, yeah, very cool stuff. But, yeah, Psalm 91, I would call it a moderate length psalm, very worth memorizing. And the man who helped me get well, taught me to eat and live from the Bible in 1996, used to have all of his kids quote this every morning before homeschool. So it kind of stuck with me for the last 31 years. And almost every day we quote it together as a family or we'll sort of popcorn where one person says part of it and the next person. So it's kind of. Jordan Rubin [00:02:00]: Kind of cool, but it is. It is one of the things we do. And at dinner when we're together. Ben Greenfield [00:02:05]: I won't put you on the spot and have you do the whole thing right now, but what's your favorite verse or one of your favorite verses from Psalm 91? Jordan Rubin [00:02:11]: Well, what I like to do with Psalm 91 because I really believe that faith and imagination are one and the same. So Psalm 91 is sort of like an action psalm. It talks about treading on serpents and scorpions. So what I like to say or what I like to do is think about myself living it out. But the best for me is, "He will give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands so you don't dash your foot against a stone." So I kind of picture myself falling off a cliff, angels catching me and having a soft Superman-like landing. You know how Superman in the old days had his back foot kicked up and all that with the Christopher Reeve version. Ben Greenfield [00:02:56]: Right, maybe with the fist going down into the ground. Jordan Rubin [00:02:59]: Yeah, maybe not that much, but yeah, that's more like, I will tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the dragon while I trample underfoot. That's more of the violent kicking and punching part. Ben Greenfield [00:03:09]: Yeah, yeah. I'm reading a book right now called Experiencing Jesus by John Eldredge, and he also has an app, like a guided prayer app that I just love. And he actually, in last night's reading was talking about how in some, I guess it would be almost like Jewish lore, serpents and scorpions would be associated with what a lot of people are talking about now, maybe thanks to guys like Joe Rogan, the nephilim, fallen angels, demons, spirits, et cetera. So it's almost as though that psalm would be like a protective prayer for going to battle against the spirits of the dark world. Jordan Rubin [00:03:46]: Well, yeah, it is funny you should mention that because a lot of this has been happening to me as well. And I'm in a men's prayer and Bible study group with my old high school friends and I just read Waking the Dead. And then we did Wild at Heart for the umpteenth time last month. So, yeah, so we're, we're, we're John Eldridging it as well over here. Ben Greenfield [00:04:10]: He's been on the podcast, if you guys are listening. Well, this is Jordan Rubin, who I'm talking with right now. I haven't given Jordan an introduction yet, but I will shortly. John Eldredge is the other guy we're talking about. And if you want some good devotionals, devotional apps, and you want a little bit, I guess, more of almost like a, a mystical, personal relationship with Jesus. I love his writings for just taking one out of the didactic and deep into the spiritual, soulful experience of Jesus. So highly recommend his stuff and I'll put a link to my interview with him in the show notes. Jordan, though, is my guest today. Ben Greenfield [00:04:49]: 3-peat - did you know this is the third time, Jordan? Jordan Rubin [00:04:51]: Yes. Ben Greenfield [00:04:52]: Yeah. Yeah. So our first one was about ducks and chickens and yaks and cows and eating locusts. And we actually touched on Bible-based eating in that first podcast. And then we did another one where you just basically fed me and the audience through the fire hose about how to start your own farm and grow your own food and grow crazy things on mushrooms and your insane productivity habits and your spiritual routines. So this third time around, I was inspired to invite you because you finished this book with another former podcast guest and friend of mine, Dr. Josh Axe. The Biblio Diet. Ben Greenfield [00:05:29]: I think the name kind of gives it away. A diet and lifestyle plan inspired by biblical principles. Just so those of, you know, opening the kimono. Jordan and I had a phone call maybe four weeks ago and he was explaining to me some crazy things he's been studying up on and learning about. Fruit leaves, of all things. And I was so intrigued by that that I wanted to touch on that in today's show, but also just cover some of the important principles in this book. Jordan is an OG in the industry. He's the founder of Garden of Life, Beyond Organic, Ancient Nutrition. Ben Greenfield [00:06:02]: He is one of America's most recognized and respected natural health experts. New York Times bestselling author of over 30 books. And this latest one, the Biblio Diet, is fantastic. If you've ever wondered how to eat the way that perhaps God intended us to. So, Jordan, welcome back for this third time, man. Jordan Rubin [00:06:22]: Thanks for having me - excited. Ben Greenfield [00:06:24]: Yeah, I want to jump right in to the thing that I don't want to run out of time to talk about. And what, like I mentioned, got me most intrigued to interview you for this book. This whole idea of healing leaves your entire chapter, chapter 14 is about it. Tell me about your inspiration to get into this. Jordan Rubin [00:06:41]: It's interesting that we talk about this now because, Ben, as you'll remember, when we were having our phone call, I said this is not enough time to share with you the most powerful revelation I have ever received about health. And I say that because it is a big deal. Having overcome inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's colitis and cancer to now, after all that time, receive this revelation. Not to mention the fact that I, you and so many of us have read the Bible back and forth, cover to cover dozens and I think I'm over a hundred times. And yet it wasn't until 2019 when two powerful scriptures leapt off the pages and changed my life forever and I believe changed my future forever, which is pretty amazing for a book that was written thousands of years ago. Ben Greenfield [00:07:32]: All right, so I know we didn't have a lot of time in our phone call for you to cover this. I think we had 20 minutes and you were doing the two year catch up with me. But we have time right now. So tell me about these verses and the inspiration. Jordan Rubin [00:07:44]: Yeah, so this is going to be in the area of mystical, as you called it earlier, if you're referring to certain writings. But my wife, Nikki, who by the way, is a retired CPA, I'm setting the stage because she is not a forest-through-the- trees visionary by trade. However, God has gotten a hold of her and given her some pretty amazing—what she would refer to—as downloads. And in the summer of 2018, so we're dating back, she tells me that she had a God idea. Now, she didn't say it was a prophecy. She didn't say it was a word from the Lord. She said it was a God idea. And she heard herself asking God a question: "Is Jordan going to discover the cure for cancer and win a Nobel Prize?" Now, Ben, I know what that sounds like. Ben Greenfield [00:08:43]: Yeah, obviously, like half the internet snickers when they hear that because everybody says the cure for cancer. So you've got quite a defense to make. Jordan Rubin [00:08:51]: Yes, I'm sharing it exactly as she said it. Now, what's interesting is she felt like this God idea happened six months prior to her sharing it with me, which was December of 2018. And when she did share it with me, my reaction was actually frustration, not jubilation. I mean, here I have this information from my wife, who I trust immensely if anyone's going to tell me God said anything—I have learned that Nikki is one who is very discerning and wise, and a lot of us should know that about our wives if we don't. So she says it to me. I'm frustrated. The reason I was frustrated, Ben, is that I was able to, through God's supernatural power and natural healing, conquer cancer myself... Jordan Rubin [00:09:41]: ...in 2008, when I was given a 0% chance to live. Not one, not two, zero. Like the doctor said, there's a 100% chance you'll be dead in three months if you don't undergo chemo and a very invasive surgery and possibly radiation. And I didn't, and God healed me. But before I get into that, let me finish the healing leaves message. So I'm frustrated because I have spent the better part of my life at this point in 2019 helping people overcome cancer, studying, researching, you name it. It has been a huge topic of mine, including overcoming cancer myself. So for me to hear that there's some cure for cancer, my immediate thought was, well, if it's a medicine, 99% of the world can't afford it or they're not insured. Jordan Rubin [00:10:33]: If it's an Amazonian rainforest herb, it's probably rare and most people can't afford it or procure it - Ben Greenfield [00:10:40]: - or it's not sustainable environmentally. Jordan Rubin [00:10:43]: Exactly. So I stopped thinking about it. And it wasn't until four months later, April 19, I remember the day, 2019. I was in my sauna, which I call my prayer sauna or prayer closet. And so when I'm in my sauna, I often listen to the Bible on an app more than I read it. I don't want to sweat on the Bible, first of all, but it's just great to be an audible learner, and I like to use technology for good whenever I can. So I'm listening to Ezekiel, which some would consider a boring book in the Old Testament, but it gets to Ezekiel in the 40s. And Ezekiel is describing a scene where there's a temple or a sanctuary, there's water coming from the temple, there's trees on both sides of the stream or river that the water forms. Jordan Rubin [00:11:34]: And I almost went multitask because I've heard this next verse so many times. Ezekiel 47:12. It says: "The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing." Now, Ben, I've read herbal books that are not biblically based, and almost every one of them will quote this verse just as a quote unquote proverb, you know, like an African proverb or an Indian proverb. And then they'll go on to say, therefore, since the leaves are for healing, you should consume spinach and parsley and kale. Ben Greenfield [00:12:11]: You mean basically interpreting it as eat salads and dark leafy greens? Jordan Rubin [00:12:15]: Exactly. And over and over again, when I've read this and I'm talking about herbal OGs like Dr. James Duke and others who are not necessarily writing from a Christian perspective, they are just simply saying all cultures believe in leaves. Well, the truth of the matter is because I have understood the difference between a perennial plant like a tree or a bush, and an annual plant like a carrot or kale or spinach, where you plant it once, disrupt the soil, harvest it, et cetera, I immediately realized this isn't leaves that the Bible is talking about. This specifically is a leaf from a fruit tree. And as soon as that passage of scripture came out of the app into my ears, I felt God say with as audible of a voice as I have ever heard, "This is it." So four months after my wife's God idea, I'm listening to Ezekiel 47:12: "The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing." And I walk out of the sauna and I tell my wife, I said, "Nikki, I know my life's purpose." Jordan Rubin [00:13:26]: Because, Ben, I immediately realized that the word that Nikki received—this answer for cancer—was not going to be found in a medicine or in an Amazonian superfood. It was found in one of the most ubiquitous, largely resourced trash that people allow to be composted or pay to take off their property: fruit tree leaves. And I began to research the ancient Hebrew language to understand two things. One, what is a tree? Because would it only include bananas and apples? And did it have to be 30ft tall? What about a bush? What about a vine? What about a shrub? And number two, and most importantly, the verse or the word that says healing—could it be mistranslated because it says the fruit is for food and the leaves for healing? I've heard people mistranslate Bible quotes all the time. Now, this word, teruphah or terupah means healing, medicine, or cure. That is all it could mean. And here I am, someone who has written at the time, I want to say, 15 books on biblical nutrition, including the Maker's Diet. And I didn't realize that Ezekiel 47:12 and later in the Bible, Revelation 22, verse 2, which says, "The leaves are for the healing of the nations." Jordan Rubin [00:14:58]: Could this be more than spiritual allegory? Could this be a physical truth that has been hidden in plain sight? And Ben, I took it at the ladder, and I began to study over 1500 fruit trees and order fruit tree leaves from all over the world. And when I say order, I mean call a mango orchard and say, "Can I buy some leaves?" Ben Greenfield [00:15:23]: I was going to say, is there like a fruittreeleaf.com or are you just basically organically hunting these down? Jordan Rubin [00:15:29]: Oh, hunting them down. Because what was interesting is that out of the top 25 herbs and spices, zero would be fruit tree leaves. This is literally thrown away, cast aside, ignored. But yet I believe it unlocks the key to cancer, longevity, and 68 other conditions or systems of the body that I've studied. And I began to procure these leaves. First, I was laughed at calling a mango orchard to bug them about buying some fruit tree leaves which aren't for sale because they're composted or hauled off and. And them sending me a FedEx envelope with some napkins in between these big green leaves was interesting enough, But I started to put this message to work. And because in Revelation 22, verse 2, it says the tree of life, which contains 12 fruits, the leaves are for the healing of the nations. Jordan Rubin [00:16:28]: I combined 12 fruit tree leaves. Some are very familiar, some are exotic. And I made what you would call a tea or a decoction. But because there's no green, black, or white tea. It's more specifically called an herbal infusion. And that's what I did. And I noticed, Ben, even though I am blessed to be healthy now, I noticed some subtle improvements in joints, in skin. But it got really exciting when I was faced with a young man sitting in front of me in Kenya. Jordan Rubin [00:17:06]: He was from the Netherlands, asking me to pray for him as he was battling terminal cancer. He had a sarcoma of the femur. He was 6'2", 110 pounds, I'm guessing, wasting away, lost his hair, looked as white as a ghost. And in my carnal mind, or I'll say in the natural, I believed I would pray for this boy, and if he didn't do something drastically different, he was going to die. I've seen it dozens of times before. He was wasting away, emaciated, and when I prayed with him and his parents, he was in tears. And then he offered a simple prayer that was a combination of weeping and screaming where he yelled out, "God help me!" And I've gotta tell you, Ben, I've said a lot of long prayers in my life, but I may have never heard the most sincere, desperate prayer, which were three words: "God help me." Jordan Rubin [00:18:08]: Now, I want to fast forward a little bit because this story gets really interesting, but I felt led to not only pray for this young man, but as his parents asked me, "Can I help him with his health?" Even though I was fighting thoughts of, they live in the Netherlands, I'm in the United States, do they have the products I would recommend? Do they have the foods? Can they even get my book? But all of that seemed to work out and over WhatsApp. In the course of, I want to say 90 to 120 days, this young man went from emaciated and sick, undergoing chemotherapy, to telling the oncologist, they are quitting chemotherapy and God's going to heal them. And by the way, the oncologist said, "We've heard this many times before. And everyone who said it is dead." They said, "You are committing suicide." And they said to his parents, his name was Jethro, his parents, they said, "You are killing your son. If you go off conventional treatment and you come back to us, which you will, we likely can't save your leg or save your life." And I'll spare all the amazing details for time's sake, but over the course of 90 to 120 days, Jethro was healed, healthy and whole, cancer free. Jordan Rubin [00:19:33]: And in an amazing twist of I'll say destiny, ended up becoming a foreign exchange student living with me in Tennessee during COVID—you can picture all this. He left at 6'4", 200 pounds, ready to share his story with the world. And it's just an exciting testament to believing God's word, believing in his creation, that he gave us everything we need for healing. And Ben, the craziest part, he was the second person perhaps ever—other than me—to consume what I now call healing leaves. And his doctors, who once said he was committing suicide, said they have never seen a result like this before, where his PET scan was lit up like a Christmas tree with metastatic cancer and a tumor in his leg the size of a baseball. Now cancer free. And I have since shared it with about 40 to 50 others. And really today we're sharing it with the world and soon in The Biblio Diet. Jordan Rubin [00:20:42]: And I have made a decision to devote a big portion of my life to getting this message out there. Because ultimately, Ben, healing leaves taste like black tea or green tea. The poorest people in the world have the greatest access to fruit tree leaves. Most people have them in their backyard or their local forest. And there's no 12 leaves that you need. Any 12 leaves from fruit trees will do. And I have seen—first and secondhand—miracles from consuming this beverage that I hope will be on everybody's kitchen table, everybody's morning routine, everyone's pantry and cupboard. And best of all, if you're someone who calls on the name of the Lord and believes He is your savior, then this is going to glorify God in a huge way. Jordan Rubin [00:21:34]: So I am beyond excited. And that is why I made a personal call to you and said, "Ben, I really would be honored if we could share this with your audience," because you have shared many amazing biohacks, many amazing remedies, superfoods, and supplements. But I can tell you there is nothing on earth that God calls the healing of the nations other than fruit tree leaves. And for that reason, plus some pretty cool science, I'm going to shout it from the rooftops every chance I get. Ben Greenfield [00:22:07]: I have so many questions and honestly, I don't care if we don't get to any other part of the book except this. I definitely want to focus in on this because I think it's the most unique thing that you and I have talked about recently. Let's put the science hats on and talk about the proposed mechanism of action behind this. Like what is going on biochemically in terms of the composition of a fruit leaf that makes you suspect that it's having some type of an anti cancer or a cytotoxic effect to cancer cells? Jordan Rubin [00:22:36]: Well, it's a great question. And fortunately there has been some data on fruit tree leaves, even though there has been a lot less than turmeric and ashwagandha and all of these cool herbs that people are so excited about. But if you look into fruit tree leaves, most of them contain 60 to 300 different compounds. And some of them are more familiar than others, by the way—and I'm not talking about orange, apple and banana only. This is expanded to nuts. It's expanded to fruits that only natives have consumed that are not commonly commercialized. So I'm literally talking about oak trees, walnut trees, hazelnut trees, because nuts are fruits as well, along with aronia berries and things like persimmon and pawpaw. Jordan Rubin [00:23:28]: I call them America's forgotten superfoods. Of course, soursop or graviola, which has been a little bit popular for its anti-cancer benefits. What about olive and grape? But to answer your question, in the leaves you find compounds that are antimicrobial, antiparasitic, -fungal, -viral and -bacterial. They lower blood sugar, they boost immunity, and reduce inflammation with all of the nutrients found in fruits and none of the sugar. And some of these include ellagic acid and other ellagitannins. So we've heard of urolithin A and there's other urolithins, ellagic acid found in walnut leaf, raspberry leaf and pomegranate leaf, along with many berry leaves, contributes to health in many ways. Number one, and in no particular order, it helps balance blood sugar by shuttling glucose into muscles and out of circulation to prevent insulin insensitivity and body fat deposition. So it is a muscle booster. Ben Greenfield [00:24:36]: I may interrupt you a few times as you go through this, but it sounds to me so far I've heard two things, Jordan. The first is that it sounds like you're a believer in the terrain hypothesis of cancer. That when you say something is antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, controls mold, mycotoxins, et cetera. That one of the reasons that people get cancer is because their internal environment is ridden with virus, bacteria, mold, fungi, et cetera. Essentially they've weakened their ability to be able to fight off cancer due to a poor terrain. Am I following you correctly on that? Jordan Rubin [00:25:13]: I believe that that is definitely a component. And in fact, I think all of those areas—inflammation, weakened immune system, and certainly microbial imbalance—and in fact, I think you and I and many others have seen a litany of testimonials for those who are undergoing cancer treatment or a cancer diagnosis they're battling using traditional antiparasitic, which are really immune modulating off-market drugs like ivermectin and mebendazole and even the animal or veterinary dewormer, fenbendazole and fruit tree leaves actually contain similar benefits to animals and humans as those antiparasitics. And in fact, Ben, we give fruit tree leaves to our water buffalo, cattle, to our sheep and to our goats in lieu of dewormers. So there's absolutely that component. And ellagitannins, one compound in fruit tree leaves can be not only contributory to balancing blood sugar, but also they in and of themselves can be antiparasitic and antifungal and, but also ellagitannins or ellagic acid can cause apoptosis in cancer cells, which is natural programmed killing or programmed cell death. So in cell lines, ellagic acid from walnut, raspberry and pomegranate can cause a destruction of cancer cells. And this is just the beginning. Jordan Rubin [00:26:49]: I mentioned oak trees. Ben, you might not know this, but quercetin, which is a powerful flavonoid, is not only found in fruit tree leaves, but it was named after its inclusion in oak tree leaves, which is of the quercus genus. So oaks are quercus this or quercus that, depending on if it's a red oak, a white oak, et cetera. So quercetin is another compound. And really the list goes on and on. There's chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid. There's hydroxytyrosol in olive leaves. There's oleuropin and other compounds. Jordan Rubin [00:27:29]: The list goes on and on. And what's great about fruit tree leaves is that there are common phytonutrients in similar fruit tree leaves, but there's also very unique compounds that you would find in a mango leaf that you wouldn't find in a blueberry leaf. However, odds are if you combine 12 fruit tree leaves that are somewhat dissimilar, meaning you don't want to have all stone fruits like apricot, peach, cherry, plum, because they're going to have more similar compounds. You want variety, if at all possible. And that's what we've done on our farms and in The Biblio Diet, particularly chapter 14, Healing Leaves, which you're referring to. We give people a list of leaves, we help people forage for leaves. Because, Ben, you're going to hopefully get off this podcast treadmill and you would find 12 leaves on your property through a little plant finder or herb finder app. And you could be drinking healing leaves in an hour, if not making healing leaves kombucha, which would take a little longer. Ben Greenfield [00:28:42]: Yeah, I actually want to ask you about this whole idea of 12 leaves, but before I do, the second thing I was going to say related to the onset of cancer and mechanism of actions that based on the insulin sensitizing aspects of some of these leaves. I'm guessing you also believe in this metabolic theory of cancer, that cancer cells particularly engage in heptiglucose utilization and lactic acid production, and that by somehow limiting the amount of glucose available to cancer cells or improving insulin sensitivity, we might be able to control that; hence, why there's so many recommendations for people who have cancer to limit glucose, sugar, and starches and consider even more of like a ketogenic approach. Jordan Rubin [00:29:23]: Absolutely. And what's great, Ben, is that by consuming fruit tree leaf tea prior to a meal, it severely restricts postprandial glucose increase, which is simply saying if you wear a CGM and you test your blood after a meal, if you've consumed healing leaves tea, if you want to call it that, you will have a blunted blood sugar spike and you're going to get all those other benefits that we already mentioned. It is amazing for metabolism, would be amazing for weight loss. And I think as crazy as this sounds, calling it an answer to cancer only greatly restricts its utility. Because I've seen three people in the last few months drink strictly mulberry leaf tea, and that's one of our favorite healing leaves of the Bible. They have either reduced or completely eliminated insulin. And these are long term—I don't like to say diabetics because I don't like to label people—but people who are battling diabetes over the long term, and two of them had a mulberry tree or bush in their backyard. Jordan Rubin [00:30:37]: They literally went in their backyard, pulled leaves off a tree, put them in water, heated it up, consumed it every day, and now they are either off or on a greatly reduced insulin intake. Amazing. Ben Greenfield [00:30:51]: And I like that it's kind of cheap. I get called out a lot for the, "Ben, I got to buy $100,000 hyperbaric cold infusion, you know, hydrogen unit to pull this off?" So, you know, planting trees is not expensive. It's still beyond what a lot of people like to do, which is just pop pills. But you've got some other—a couple of the practical things that you mentioned. You said 12 leaves. Ben Greenfield [00:31:14]: Are we—are you saying that I need to go to 12 different fruit trees and select 12 different leaves and combine them? Are you saying each time I make tea, I just use 12 leaves of whatever tree? Jordan Rubin [00:31:27]: It's a great question. I believe there's more power in the 12 different fruit tree leaves because again, if you look at Revelation, chapter 22, verse 2, it's similar to Ezekiel. It talks about a sanctuary, a river, but in this case, it talks about the Tree of Life. And Ben, for us Bible geeks, the Tree of Life was meant to provide eternal longevity. And listen, a lot of our friends and colleagues are trying to live to 120 or beyond. But when Adam and Eve sinned and got kicked out of the Garden of Eden, you probably remember there were cherubim that guarded the Tree of Life so that man could not reach his hand out and live forever. That is right out of Scripture. I can also tell you another time how the fall of man or man's sin is causing the destruction of our planet. Jordan Rubin [00:32:23]: And what some refer to as climate change is all part of that curse of man. And we are in the process of proving that that can be reversed through. I'll say this is going to sound heavy to some of your listeners, but the blood of Jesus and him taking those keys back and reversing that curse. So I am walking proof and living proof that we can rebuild our bodies and the planet. And it's kind of in the same methodology of planting these fruit trees. And that's exactly what we've done. But to answer your question, I prefer 12 different fruit tree leaves, like Revelation 22, two mentions, because there are 12 fruits on the Tree of Life. And I do think you'll get benefits from consuming one or two leaves. Jordan Rubin [00:33:14]: But when I work with people, and it's almost always severely ill people, I recommend 12 different fruit tree leaves. And I've been making this for people from my own leaves for the last several years. So that, I think is the most powerful array of phytonutrients or phytochemicals in those 12 fruit tree leaves. Ben Greenfield [00:33:36]: Okay. So for a guy like me, because I live on 12 acres, I've already— Jordan Rubin [00:33:38]: —Perfect number there, Ben— Ben Greenfield [00:33:40]: —apple. Yeah. Cherry, peach, apple and pear. And I could take like my Plant Snap app on my phone. I could walk around and look at a few other plants, identify whether or not they would fit into the category of trees. Let's say I identify eight more. So I'm harvesting those leaves and systematically kind of creating this tea on a daily basis. And I want to talk about the tea shortly. Ben Greenfield [00:34:03]: But let's say somebody lives in a highly urban environment. Is there a place that they could go—and let's say they don't want herbicides and pesticides and crap on their leaves where they could literally just order leaves of 12 different kinds? Jordan Rubin [00:34:16]: Yeah, you would want to go to one of those herbal companies. There's Mountain Rose herbs, there's Starwest. These are kind of bulk herb companies. And you can piece that together. Unsurprisingly, Ben, because I planted 600,000 fruit trees, we are working on creating products out of healing leaves and have been for years. They're not currently available, but if someone wants more information on the types of leaves we recommend and perhaps where to find them, The Biblio Diet book will have it and it's available for order. However, we are giving away, Ben, that chapter 14 you referenced for free to anyone who wants to log on to thebibliodiet.com so we have a download of chapter 14, Healing Leaves. Jordan Rubin [00:35:04]: It's free and it'll give a little more insight into the benefits, the health conditions that we believe healing leaves can help you fight. And some of our top leaves to find. But if you do a simple search, you can find a majority of fruit tree leaves, from strawberry to blackberry to blueberry to bilberry to soursop and many other species. But in your case, Ben—and I have not been to your home—I'm guessing you also have some evergreens, perhaps like juniper, which is from the cedar family, and pine. Many species of pine produce fruit. Juniper produces berries. Those two are amazing additions to healing leaves, even though their leaves are less leaf-like and more needle like. Ben Greenfield [00:35:55]: Okay, okay, got it. You mentioned this tea. So let's say I get my leaves, I'm going to make this tea. What's the best way to make the tea? And remember, we're talking to people who don't have like two hours in the kitchen. They want the fastest, easiest way to consume these things. Jordan Rubin [00:36:10]: The easiest way is to just make it like a loose leaf tea where you put the leaves—and the ratio that I recommend is usually 1 tablespoon of dried leaves for each of the 12. Grab a pot. I would like to say a 2 and a half quart pot, but think of a pot where you make spaghetti. So you're gonna fill it with water. You're gonna put either a tablespoon of each of 12 leaves or more if they're fresh. The dried leaves will crunch into about 12 tablespoons. Don't worry if you overdo it, no big deal. Jordan Rubin [00:36:41]: And you wanna bring the water to a boil with the leaves in it, pour it through a colander after you let it simmer for a little bit. And I make two weeks at a time. So I literally will go in with a big old stock pot and I will fill it to the top with lots of water and leaves. I will bring it to a boil, I will simmer it for 12 minutes, I'll let it cool down and then I fill, Ben, 8 half gallon jars with it. And that's where I pour my healing leaves and my family's every day for two weeks. Now, if you want it even simpler, just put leaves in a glass, boil some water, pour it over the glass or mug where the leaves are, wait a few minutes till it gets to be a tolerable temperature, and drink it just like you would tea. Ben Greenfield [00:37:35]: That doesn't sound too hard, especially if you do it as a batch. You said dried though. So if I go and harvest all these leaves, can I just lay them out in the sun on a towel? Do you use a food dehydrator? An oven at low temperature? Does it matter? Jordan Rubin [00:37:49]: Any of the above. So Jethro, who is the young man who overcame cancer when I started working with him, it was September in the Netherlands. He went to an orchard, picked a bunch of leaves and dried them in his oven with a pilot light on low. And then they went and bought a food dehydrator. You could do not pilot light, pilot setting, but you can do any of the above. Obviously, if you want to dry them outside, make sure it's truly dry. And you're going to maybe have some insects around, but it should be minimal. They don't attract bugs the way that fruit or anything sweet would. But any of those ways would be fine. Jordan Rubin [00:38:25]: And in the summer, which we're talking right now, in the summer, while you've got a few more days of growing time where you are in the Pac Northwest, you can just pick them off the trees and put them right into the water and boil them. But yes, save some for the winter. It will be well worth it. Ben Greenfield [00:38:44]: All right. bengreenfieldlife.com/biblio I'll link to the book, my other podcast with Jordan, and some of these recommendations: B-I-B-L-I-O. Jordan, can we talk about some other parts of your book? Jordan Rubin [00:38:55]: Yes. How about the Wisest Meal on Earth that will debunk some major health myths. Ben Greenfield [00:39:02]: The Wisest Meal on Earth? Jordan Rubin [00:39:03]: The Wisest Meal on Earth. There's three amazing revelations that I had since I've written the other biblical health books that for some reason were hidden for me and I remember I was walking on my farm in Tennessee and I said to Todd, our farm director, as we were talking about the new Biblio diet project, which I was working on, I said, you know, Todd, I think there's a chapter in the Bible that talks about exactly what King Solomon ate every day. So I went back, and sure enough, I Kings, chapter four, lists out Solomon's daily provisions. Now, Solomon, for those of you who don't know, was King David's son and known by God as the wisest man who ever lived and the richest man who ever lived. In fact, historically, it was said that all the kings of the world sat at the feet of Solomon and were amazed at his knowledge of science and humans, and the world. So this is a man who was given so much wisdom. He knew about plant life, animal life, and humans and what he ate every day with all the money in the world, literally, people came and brought him riches and treasures, and I think they've estimated his wealth as a quadrillionaire. Jordan Rubin [00:40:30]: It's more than anyone has today. Ben Greenfield [00:40:32]: People could take the deep rabbit hole, dive down Google and Reddit on this. Apparently he had ships going all the way to South America, and we find, like, Hebrew inscriptions in, like, the Amazon. And so he was likely bringing stuff from all over the world, like, you know, cinnamon, gold, myrrh, frankincense, like, you name it, from, like, probably one of the busiest shipping routes at his time. Jordan Rubin [00:40:56]: Yes. And he had an inner circle or a court that ate with him every day. And what he was feeding them and consuming was primarily meat and bread. Ben Greenfield [00:41:09]: You just, like, isolated and offended two big, big groups of the dogmatic nutrition world. Meat and bread. Jordan Rubin [00:41:15]: So some people have said for a long time that meat will kill you and kill the planet because cows are emitting greenhouse gases and all the other stuff. And then, of course, now there's a pretty thriving carnivore eating community that says plants are trying to kill you. Ben Greenfield [00:41:33]: Plants, including bread. Jordan Rubin [00:41:35]: Including bread. And then others that don't think plants are trying to kill you think bread's trying to kill you. And they've written books like Wheat Belly and Grain Brain. So I'm not arguing that the research done by these doctors doesn't have a little bit of merit or a lot of merit. But what I don't argue is that the word of God trumps science. And in this case, King Solomon ate grass-fed cattle. And I'm going to chop some more boots, Ben. He ate stall-fed cattle. Jordan Rubin [00:42:05]: Now, I'm not saying they were confinement animals that were Injected with hormones and antibiotics and fed glyphosate rich grain. But they were fed in a stall. Whether it was hay or grain or herbs, I don't know—grass fed cattle, ,stall-fed cattle, meal and flour that would be grain and bread and choice fowl as well as wild deer and roebuck. And it didn't say he ate this occasionally. These were Solomon's daily provisions. But while I'm at it, I believe that meat is one of the quintessential biblical superfoods, particularly red meat. Because anytime anyone could afford it or anytime anyone had an esteemed guest, they killed what was known as the fatted calf, which would have been an intact bull between four of six years of age. Jordan Rubin [00:42:59]: And Ben, here's something else that'll blow your mind. That intact bull where they consumed the meat called the fatted calf, would have provided actual testosterone and testosterone precursors to men and women, contributing to fertility and youth. Ben Greenfield [00:43:18]: You mean in the actual meat? Like you don't have to eat the testicles? Jordan Rubin [00:43:21]: In the actual meat. And I have getting down a little bit of a, I'll call it a water buffalo trail, not a rabbit trail. But I have a son who plays college football and for an entire off-season I fed him only food from water buffalo. We raise water buffalo. And I had a couple of mature bulls slaughtered, butchered and prepared. And he ate two pounds a day of water buffalo bull meat. And he gained in one off season, 65 pounds. Now, some people on the call don't want to gain 65 pounds, but the point is— Ben Greenfield [00:44:02]: —I'm assuming that's both fat mass and fat-free mass— Jordan Rubin [00:44:05]: —it was all of it. But his strength went up 25%. Record numbers. You just wouldn't believe it. He went in as a freshman as arguably the strongest player up against 6th year college students with a Covid year. And my son, I have one biological son and five adopted children. My son's genetics, from myself and Nikki, involve probably a 12-inch vertical leap and not a whole lot of body mass. So I'm just giving... Jordan Rubin [00:44:36]: ...yeah, just giving you an example that if you look into Scripture, into the Bible, you don't have to look so deep to find some of the greatest longevity-boosting, health-promoting secrets known to man. And if you think people look the same way in the Bible as they do today, you're wrong. Because obesity was so rare that it was mentioned every time someone was fat or obese. They called it out in the Bible because it was so abnormal. Ben Greenfield [00:45:08]: Yeah, I noticed that. It seems a little rude, but yeah, they do. Famous for all time and the best-selling book of all time for being fat. Jordan Rubin [00:45:15]: Exactly. The, the king of Eglon had apparently, rolls that when he was stabbed with a sword, you couldn't even see the butt of the sword because of his fat rolls. And then there is a couple of other references, like Eli, who was the priest before Samuel, he leaned back in a chair and they said he was so fat the chair broke. But outside of that, it was very rare. Ben Greenfield [00:45:40]: We should clarify, though, being fat is not synonymous with eating fat, because throughout the Bible, you find that God blesses people with fat of the land, you know, with honey, with milk, with bread. So nutrition and diet enrichment is often something that is a reward from God. It's the overconsumption of it, you know, the crossing over into gluttony, which becomes an issue. But the idea that there's not a lot of obesity in the Bible doesn't mean that eating fat is bad. And in fact, fat's kind of considered a blessing in the Bible. Jordan Rubin [00:46:10]: Well, Ben, my revelation number three, which didn't even make it in The Biblio Diet because the book was already written. This literally happened three weeks ago. And how somebody could read through the Bible consistently like I have for 15 years and miss anything related to food is beyond me. But this is so cool. Job, who was a man in the Bible that predated Moses and some of the other biblical luminaries, he was stricken with poverty. He went from being a wealthy, blessed man to losing his wealth. He lost his children, and he lost his health. And towards the end of Job, in chapter 29, Job is talking to God. Jordan Rubin [00:46:54]: In the longest conversation ever recorded between God and man. Amazing. It'll give you chills. Read the end of Job. God literally talks about his creation and says, more or less, Job, how dare you talk to me like this. I created the stars, the sky, the animals. I know where thunder is made and the factories where lightning is stored. Anyway, so cool. Jordan Rubin [00:47:16]: But this is how Job describes his previous prime of life, Ben. He said, in the prime of my life, cream poured out on the streets and olive oil welled out from a stone. So I believe that if Job described the prime of his life as a wealthy, blessed man being bathed and having all kinds of access to cream and olive oil, you better believe I want those two foods in my diet every day. The idea that our ancestors didn't eat a lot of meat and didn't eat a lot of fat is just not true. The only reason people wouldn't eat meat and fat is if they couldn't procure it, hunt it, or afford it, period. End of story. Everybody throughout history goes for the fattiest, most nutrient dense animal foods above all else. Ben Greenfield [00:48:14]: Yeah, comma, they also fasted a lot. Jordan Rubin [00:48:17]: Sure did. Ben Greenfield [00:48:18]: With the Wisest Meal on Earth—so you said it was meat, milk, and what was the third one? Jordan Rubin [00:48:22]: It was meat, bread and poultry. Ben Greenfield [00:48:25]: Sorry, meat. Jordan Rubin [00:48:25]: Pretty much. Ben Greenfield [00:48:26]: Okay, got it. What about the whole idea, like back to the elephant in the room, like the leaves and the fruits? Obviously you said the leaves are for healing, but then it does say in that verse that the fruits are for food. Do we find that Solomon placed an emphasis on like berries, pomegranates, mangoes, some of these fruits that seem to have a lot of pretty nutrient dense properties. Jordan Rubin [00:48:46]: I can't confirm that Solomon did, but we know that David, we know that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and many biblical I'll say ancestors consumed fruits like olives, grape, figs, dates, pomegranate. In fact, Ben, this is so cool. Pomegranate was known as the royal fruit of the Bible back in biblical times. And the Average pomegranate contains 613 seeds or arils. You know, those little delicious seeds with juicy fruit around them. Ben Greenfield [00:49:20]: Yeah, I believe you haven't counted them, but I believe you that is the. Jordan Rubin [00:49:23]: Same number of commandments in the Old Testament of the Bible. How amazing is that? What are the odds? Ben Greenfield [00:49:30]: Huh? That's interesting. Okay, so kind of like the thing I'm asked a lot because it's no secret. I talk on the podcast, I'm a Christian and I believe the Bible. And then people say, well, you eat pork and shellfish, because I see you talking about Seatopia shrimp on your website and you occasionally show your wife's bone-in reverse-sear pork chop recipe. I think you probably know where I'm coming from, Jordan. I say, well, you can get clean versions of that stuff now, like pastured pork and shellfish that's been screened. But with you having written so much about the Bible-based diet, and I don't even remember if we talked about this last time or not, we might have. Ben Greenfield [00:50:12]: What's the deal with pork and shellfish? Jordan Rubin [00:50:14]: Well, Ben, you know that I want to be a gracious guest on your program and try not to disagree with you. Ben Greenfield [00:50:21]: I don't care if you offend me and my diet. Tell—tell me straight up. Jordan Rubin [00:50:24]: I think pork and shellfish and any derivatives of that should be avoided at all costs. That's how I've lived my life. And I remember, Ben, when I first was introduced to the concept of eating the way the Bible says. I read a book called God's Key to Health and Happiness by Reverend Elmer Josephson. This was one of three books I read in 1996 that changed my life forever. And Reverend Josephson was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He was a pastor, he was a God-fearing man and dedicated his life to serving God. And he more or less yelled at God with his terminal diagnosis and said, "God, you promised me in your word to live a long and abundant life. Jordan Rubin [00:51:10]: Why am I dying?" And Elmer Josephson heard God's voice say, "Because you haven't followed my commandments." And Elmer Josephson read Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, which said, Pork and shellfish, I'm going to paraphrase, are detestable, the same way human excrement and filth would be detestable. And he ceased eating pork and shellfish. His book details how he was cured of stomach cancer and he tried to spend the rest of his life telling others that God's commandments are the same yesterday, today and forever. They may not determine your salvation. In fact, the old joke is, can you eat pork and shellfish and still get to heaven? Some of us might say yes, and you'll get there a lot sooner. But I do believe, Ben, understanding a lot about regenerative farming—I've done it for nearly 20 years... Jordan Rubin [00:52:07]: ...the anatomy of a pig as a monogastric, just like a rat, a skunk, a dog or a cat is not able to detoxify properly, not able to metabolize nutrients. And the idea that you can have a pig eat healthy things would mean 24/7 surveillance because a pig will eat tumors off of other pigs. And I always used to say this and it freaked people out. Elmer Josephson, in the book God's Key to Health and Happiness, observed an experiment where there were four pigs stacked vertically in cages and they only fed the top pig. And the others did just fine. I'll let you fill in the blanks. Same thing for shellfish. There are so many amazing meats and fish to eat. Jordan Rubin [00:52:55]: If you're somebody listening and you're following a paleo diet or a keto diet or a carnivore diet or an omnivorous diet, and you have not avoided pork and shellfish, you may benefit from doing so because of the toxins, microorganisms and more. And this is where, Ben I disagree with people from the Weston A. Price Foundation, a lot of the, I'll say evolutionary diet experts. And it's my story and I'm sticking to it. Ben Greenfield [00:53:24]: Okay, but you don't think that, like, with Levitical law based around hygiene, that in an era of modern hygiene, some of those things are no longer applicable? Like, you know, I don't want to be gross, but, like, if, you know, if a woman is on her period, you'd have to send her out of the village or the camp or whatever for a week because she's unclean. And now we've got modern hygiene and tampons, things like that. And in the case of pigs and shellfish, couldn't we just get cleaner versions of them? And the law that was once meant for good hygiene would no longer really be something we need to follow from a ceremonial standpoint? Jordan Rubin [00:54:02]: I do not believe so. I believe, based on science, that shellfish, for example, are the best purifiers of polluted waterways because they store toxins. People say, but oysters are high in metals. I just was on a podcast in Phoenix yesterday, and maybe it was the day before, and I really upset the host because she believes oysters are a great source of minerals. And I would agree, but the minerals include cadmium, mercury, lead, and arsenic. So, Ben, I do not believe that this particular principle in Scripture can be changed or improved based on hygiene. Believe me, I can go into details on a woman's uncleanness. I can explain that. Jordan Rubin [00:54:43]: And there's some cool elements to that as well, believe me, with fertility. But I do not believe that pork and shellfish are suitable to eat the same way. I don't believe dogs, cats and skunks are. But for some reason, people look the other way when it comes to pork because they don't want to give up their bacon. And I might be one of the only health experts that is pounding this drum, but for me and my house, we will not touch pork and shellfish. And it's not for spiritual reasons. It's not a kosher thing. They are not suitable for human consumption based on anatomy and physiology. Jordan Rubin [00:55:21]: And I've seen too many people cut those things out and get better to believe otherwise. Ben Greenfield [00:55:28]: Really interesting. Well, I'm a big self quant guy and it wouldn't be a huge sacrifice for me because right now, to be honest, totally honest, I have pork about once a month. I have shellfish about once a month. So I could cut it out and take labs and maybe see how I do over six months. I'm game to try it. Okay, I want to lightning round a few of the things that you Jordan, because I know we're running slightly short on time, but I want to touch on these: milk. Not all milk is created equal. Knowing what you know, having been in the industry as long as you've been in it, obviously milk is encouraged in the Bible. Ben Greenfield [00:56:01]: What kind of milk would be the healthiest for people to drink or to give to their kids and their family? Jordan Rubin [00:56:06]: The healthiest milk that you can find easily would be an A2 milk that is grass-fed and organic, preferably non-homogenized, that is available ben everywhere, including Costco, which is unbelievable to me. I'm so thrilled about that. But that's sort of the best milk that someone who wants to go to a store can buy. Now if you want to know the best, the best milk on the planet or dairy products, I would consume an A2 raw grass-fed organic dairy from an animal that produces milk that is naturally homogenized and metabolizes all of the carotenoids. Now I know you love sciency things so I'm going to throw that all out at you. But what I mean is raw milk from water buffalo, goat or sheep. Now we know that cow's milk, that's raw, which can be really good, the cream separates, it rises to the top and it turns yellow when the cows are eating grass in season because of the carotenoids. The reason being cows don't metabolize carotenoids very well. Jordan Rubin [00:57:17]: But a goat, sheep or water buffalo, I raise them so I know when they eat only pasture grasses, herbs, legumes and forbs, they produce naturally homogenized milk. The fat globules are very small and absorbable and the milk is always white even when they're eating June spring pastures. It's because they naturally metabolize the carotenoids and I believe you're getting downstream metabolites from these powerful components. So that would be the best-case scenario. It's what I do primarily. I want to say this though: Milk is a superfood in its right form or it could be a toxic plethora of junk. If you eat skim, I call it blue milk, skim milk that has been fortified, pasteurized, homogenized, even though it's skim, which is ridiculous and has all these traces of antibiotics and hormones. Ben Greenfield [00:58:20]: Yeah, A2, grass-fed. Everything aside, multiple studies show the majority of health benefits from dairy consumption come from full fat, not skim or fat free. So that alone is important to know. That wasn't too too lightning round. Jordan Rubin [00:58:33]: I know I'm not a lightning round. Ben Greenfield [00:58:35]: These next. I know you're such a depth of knowledge. I was reading on green med Info Sire G He puts out some pretty good information, but he did a pretty big takedown article on bread yesterday calling out not just gluten but lectin, herbicides, pesticides, opiates, the things that you've heard before. But Jordan, let's say someone wrote an article like that, yet they still said but if he can find the right kind of grain, you could skirt some of those issues. So if you were going to buy bread or get grain to make bread, what would you choose as your top go-to? Jordan Rubin [00:59:06]: My favorite bread is sourdough that is long-term fermented, made from an unhybridized grain like Einkorn. And for those of you who haven't heard of Einkorn, it's E-I-N-K-O-R-N. It's not anything to do with corn, the plant or grain. Einkorn is a biblical grain. It has never been hybridized, which means it's lower in gluten, higher in non-gluten proteins and less likely to cause allergies. Now we have bred all the wrong qualities into cows that produce milk and into wheat and barley and other grains. So I consume sourdough bread and by the way, Ben, I had Crohn's and colitis, one of the worst cases documented in history. And part of my recovery was raw cream and sourdough whole grain bread. Ben Greenfield [01:00:02]: So crazy because most doctors say you shouldn't even be sniffing that stuff. Jordan Rubin [01:00:06]: Nope. So I do. And you don't have to eat it. I mean, listen, Sayer is a very close friend of mine and colleague and I don't disagree that modern bread that you get in a grocery store is horrible. But the sourdough craze is on. And if you can make your own sourdough bread or buy it at a specialty or health food store, even people with gluten sensitivity can often tolerate it because the sourdough or fermentation process eliminates the gluten, virtually lowers the gliadin content which is causing the opioid effect that you are referring to. It doesn't have glyphosate and it is actually a great source of energy and nutrients. But you want to consume white bread. Jordan Rubin [01:00:52]: I'll tell you, the whiter the bread, the sooner you're dead because it is total garbage and you can leave it on your patio for 50 years. Ben Greenfield [01:00:59]: I'll give a shout out to Dr. Jeffrey Bland, you know, father of functional medicine. He's doing some cool stuff with Himalayan Tartary Buckwheat. Yes, he is another one that I found I do just fine with. And my wife uses a—I think it's a local red berry kind of ancient, unhybridized grain for our sourdough at home. And then we've got milk or goats, so you're making me happy, Jordan. Ben Greenfield [01:01:18]: All right, last one. People hear about the Bible and they think honey, you know, it's found all over in Proverbs, for example, and throughout the Old Testament. Let's say somebody's going to do honey. I'm assuming it's not the plastic teddy bear off the grocery store shelf. But what would you pick if you were going to throw honey in there along with the bread and the milk and the red meat, for example? Jordan Rubin [01:01:40]: You're getting all of us hungry. Ben, I like to say this when it comes to honey for culinary use or as a sweetener, look for unheated or raw and unfiltered. Those are the terms you want to look for. Ideally, the honey crystallizes a bit when you leave it at room temperature, which means that it hasn't been ultra-heated. If you want a therapeutic honey, I like honey that is from New Zealand. You've probably heard of Manuka honey. Ben Greenfield [01:02:10]: Dude, I love Manuka. We had a sponsor for a while and I've still got a pantry full of stuff. Manukura honey. It's so good. Jordan Rubin [01:02:17]: Absolutely. And probably my favorite, Melapana honey, which is found in South America. It's in Costa Rica, Central America. Those are made by stingless small bees. And that honey can be used as an eye drop to treat eye infections. It's great for upper respiratory infections. It is a very cool, super honey. And it never thickens. Jordan Rubin [01:02:39]: So those are examples. I've also tried a Madagascar honey, Ben, that is off the charts amazing. But you want unheated and unfiltered and you can use it as a sweetener. It's almost miraculous as a topical wound healer. And it is literally a medicine cabinet. We talk all about honey, milk, bread, even salt. We didn't cover in The Biblio Diet because if the Bible says something's good, I want to know why. And I want to teach people how to acquire the food and how to consume the food. Jordan Rubin [01:03:14]: Because after all, Ben, my two principles here are eat what God created for food, number one, and number two, eat food in a form that is healthy for the body. If you can do that, your nutrition will absolutely contribute to amazing health. Ben Greenfield [01:03:33]: I love it. And yeah, you've got cancer-fighting nutrition, like we talked about. Meats, veggies, fruit, dairy, spices, salts, oils. We didn't even crack into fasting and some of the daily eating plans in there. But the book for those of you watching is the Biblio Diet. I'll link to that. My other podcast with Jordan, his website, everything at BenGreenfieldLife.com/Biblio —B-I-B-L-I-O, where you can leave your questions, your comments, your feedback. Ben Greenfield [01:04:02]: Jordan, I love talking to you, man. I always learn—I would say at least five new things every time we chat. Jordan Rubin [01:04:07]: Well, I appreciate it, Ben. And I know that there are so many amazing technologies out there. I see some behind you and I incorporate a lot of cool hacks and biohacks. But I never allow myself to get too far away from the C reator and what he gave for our longevity, our metabolism, our pain, our brain health, and of course, fighting a disease that's cost us too many lives and too many loved ones and too many precious hours. And that's my passion, is really to see the planet healed, people fed and disease eradicated. Ben Greenfield [01:04:46]: Keep up the great work, brother. I love you.

Please let us know Topic:Company News Elon Musk has been offered one of the largest CEO payment packages in history. (Reuters: Hamad I Mohammed) Tesla's board has proposed a $US1 trillion ($1.52 trillion) compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk in what would be the largest corporate pay package in history. The move underscores the hold Mr Musk has over the car maker as it attempts to transform into an AI and robotics powerhouse. Here's what we know about the package. Elon Musk will need to increase Tesla's value eightfold. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer) The proposed plan would grant Mr Musk up to 12 per cent of Tesla's stock, worth about $US1.03 trillion if the company hits its target market value of $US8.6 trillion. The plan requires boosting Tesla's valuation nearly eightfold, or about $US7.5 trillion, over the next decade. To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1 per cent of the company, Mr Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $US2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $US8.6 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia. Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. To increase Tesla's value the company will need to sell 20 million vehicles. (AP Photo: Julio Cortez) Mr Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo. Mr Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount. If fully earned, the award would materially increase Mr Musk's voting power from his roughly 13 per cent stake, intensifying debate over governance and succession. Tesla emphasised that Mr Musk would receive no salary or cash bonus, with all compensation linked to performance. The package is designed to keep Mr Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Mr Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. Mr Musk has been criticised as being distracted from Tesla. Elon Musk's willingness to challenge Donald Trump has raised concerns at Tesla. His foray into party politics and his willingness to challenge President Donald Trump had heightened concerns among Tesla investors and analysts about potential distractions and had previously fuelled talk about looking for a new chief. In July, Mr Musk announced plans to launch a third political party, the "America Party", following a public clash with Trump over a tax cut and government spending bill. Tesla's board has urged shareholders to vote against a proposal calling for a political neutrality policy, which would have expanded board oversight of Mr Musk's political activities. Yes, and Mr Musk is likely to get it at the company's annual meeting in November. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Mr Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar research director Courtney Yu said. None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Mr Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with several union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. Union figures and public-sector treasurers have voiced concerns about the proposed payment. (AP: Jose Luis Magana) "We urge shareholders to reject Musk's money grab, take away the Tesla board's rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. "This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Mr Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Mr Musk was worth that much. "He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk's actions outside of Tesla," he said. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in Texas after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a $US56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Mr Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. A judge has ruled that Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $86.6 billion compensation package even though shareholders of the electric vehicle company had voted to reinstate it earlier this year. Last year, the company's shareholders voted to "ratify" Mr Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Mr Musk's pay package. Mr Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification. In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Mr Musk's $US56 billion compensation are on appeal. In 2018, the company barred Mr Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law. Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges thanks to laws in Texas.

Title: Virgin Media presenter Katja Mia: ‘I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times’

When Dublin TV presenter, influencer and model Katja Mia was doing the Leaving Cert more than a decade ago, she plastered the study area in the Blanchardstown family home with motivational quotes from the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. “I was not blessed academically, I was one of those people who had to work really hard to get just above average,” she says. “I had all these quotes posted up everywhere, I’d write down the number of points I wanted to get so I could see them.” She was manifesting before manifesting became a thing? “I suppose I was,” she laughs. “But I also studied for hours and hours. Nothing came easily.” While it’s been an often-derided TikTok trend for a few years now, manifesting – the idea that our thoughts and actions can positively influence what we accomplish – has actually been a thing for a while. There’s a Sanskrit text called Rigveda from 3,500 years ago containing hymns that suggest that by focusing on our hopes and dreams we can influence personal destiny. At any rate, the presenter is something of a poster girl for the trend. From a family of Burundian immigrants a combination of ambition, determination, hard work, luck and – scoff if you like – manifesting eventually landed her her dream job presenting the Six O’Clock Show on Virgin Media. We’re talking in the boardroom of the television station before she goes to studio to record the hour-long live show. She’s wearing black athleisure wear and there’s a large - “lab grown” she qualifies - diamond engagement ring sparkling on her finger. In a couple of weeks, she’ll go to Burundi, in east Africa, for the first time in 15 years to take part in a traditional “dot” engagement ceremony in front of 300 family and friends. It will be a chance for her fiancé and boyfriend of eight years, Daragh Curran, an influencer called The Guinness Guru who specialises in tasting pints of the black stuff all over the world, to meet her extended family. Having grown up in Dublin she’s looking forward to immersing herself in the culture of her parent’s homeland, royal Burundian drummers and traditional costumes included. “I’m embracing all of it,” she smiles. Her mother Carinie is all over the arrangements. The wedding next year will be an Irish one. “We’ll do our own thing for that,” she says. The goal, as she grew up, was financial security, which explains the motivational quotes and commitment to her studies. She was born in Germany, in 1996, after her parents sought refuge there from the civil war in Burundi, a protracted conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, which killed an estimated 300,000 people from 1993 to 2005. Her uncle had been murdered in a grenade and knife attack in the former Belgian colony and “there was a threat to my dad’s family in particular so he had to flee the country”. [ Festive and funny tales with Thalia Heffernan, Katja Mia, Killian Sundermann and moreOpens in new window ] The family spent a couple of years in a village near Frankfurt but when they went to get their visa renewed it was denied. The family’s difficulties in Germany were compounded by the racism they were subjected to by neo-Nazis. Unable to return to Burundi, the family came to Ireland as undocumented immigrants. She was only 17 months old when they moved to Dublin, first settling in Blackrock. The Department of Justice initially refused their application for asylum on the grounds that they had made their original application in Germany. Threatened with deportation she says her father Joseph was given assistance in his campaign for his family to stay in Ireland by “some excellent people” including former Irish Times journalist Andy Pollak. “My dad saw him talking on a news programme one day and looked up his number in the phone book,” she says. Later, I find an Irish Times news report from 1998 about the family’s experience in Germany and the racist abuse they suffered there. “It was torture,” her mother Carinie told Irish Times reporter Paul Cullen back then. “We had already left one form of atrocious situation, [in Burundi] and now we were in another. We were just looking for somewhere calm, where our children can grow up and be integrated in society.” Eventually, they were given leave to remain in Ireland and got their Irish passports. They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age Her parents’ experience as immigrants has had a significant influence on the presenter. “I was always aware of their struggle. They were educated but English is not their first language so they had to start from the bottom and I witnessed that.” Joseph and Carinie, who also speak French, encouraged their four children to speak English at home instead of Kirundi, the official language of Burundi, so that they would have a better chance of integrating. Her mother worked in a supermarket and her father, now a taxi driver, had two jobs at one point. “I would see him come home from one shift and put on his uniform for a second job. I think when I saw that it really instilled a work ethic and made me put my head down. They came here for me to have a better life. They didn’t want me to struggle. When you see people struggle it makes you want to go after security and financial stability”. The family moved from Blackrock to Usher’s Quay in the city centre and then to Lucan where she attended primary and secondary school even after the family eventually settled in Blanchardstown. “Growing up I always felt Irish, I sang Irish songs, did Irish dancing, on Brigid’s Day we celebrated Nano Nagle. When you are migrating to a new country, integrating is everything, especially for kids.” Every Monday afternoon from the age of six she’d go to a stage school in Lucan where she thrived - dancing and singing in shows. It wasn’t until the move to Blanchardstown that the family became victims of racist attacks. “We were the first black family on our council estate. There were a lot of teenagers coming to our house, throwing eggs at our windows, breaking my mum’s car door on a weekly basis. It was a kind of torment, to be honest.” “I remember vividly one day being egged by a group of boys, and I was only 11 or 12, I had my uniform on and I was just drenched in eggs ... you have to reassure yourself that people are ignorant, they’re doing it out of fear and you should not waste your energy trying to defend yourself because you’ve nothing to defend. “And I think it stood to me, because even now, working in media, it’s inevitable that you’re going to get comments, people that don’t like you for whatever reason, whether it’s the dress you’re wearing your make-up or whatever.” This resilience was modelled by her parents who changed the narrative when it came to their four children. “They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age. They’d tell me: ‘You have amazing skin, you are a descendant of the Tutsi tribe, you are beautiful, be proud’.” When it came to choosing her career path, despite her love of performing, her need for security led her to pursue finance. The motivational quotes paid off. She got enough points for a finance and economics degree from Maynooth University and went into banking as a depository analyst working in funds. In the pandemic, she began a remote job in Bank of America but she wasn’t happy. “I was lost,” she says of her time in the corporate world. “I had no passion. I didn’t know what I was doing. I even started praying about it.” By now manifesting was everywhere. “I read the books, I listened to podcasts and I started posting on Instagram almost as a tool to throw s**t at the wall and see what stuck”. She began curating her feed “in a fun, aesthetic way” building an audience. When a friend needed a presenter for a music show in Swords, she nervously accepted. “It was a nine or 10-hour day but it felt like about 10 minutes because I was having the time of my life. I just thought, how can I make this a job?” There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’ She had grown up admiring presenters like Kathryn Thomas and Martin King “who I ended up working with”. She’d watch E! News all the time. “I was obsessed with television culture, but I had no idea how to get into it ... then a friend sent me a link to a competition for online presenters and I ended up winning it.” The competition, to be a brand ambassador for Love Island presenter Maya Jama’s skincare range Mij Masks, was open to people across the UK and Ireland. It was the break she was hoping for and led to Virgin Media getting in touch. She began there as a contributor, moving to hosting on Weekend AM with Martin King. At one stage, when Ireland AM presenter Muireann O’Connell was on holiday, she got a call to replace her for three shows. “That was just wild to me. My whole family was jumping on the bed. It’s a three-hour live show. I’ll never forget that moment.” Eventually, she was named as the new permanent host with Brian Dowling of the station’s Six O’Clock Show. That was in November 2023, less than two years after landing her first presenting job. “Ideally, in a dream world, I would have done a degree in media and journalism, naturally I still feel impostor syndrome, but I learn from people, I learn by making mistakes. It worked out the way it worked out and I have so much backing in Virgin Media, I’ve been really supported.” [ We cannot police the streets if online material is not regulatedOpens in new window ] In the meantime she had been spotted by a modelling scout on Instagram, which she calls “the modern day CV for creatives”, and was a “curvy” model for a few years. Last year, when she was one of the celebrities competing in Dancing With the Stars, she received abusive messages about her size. “I got comments about whether my dance partner could lift me, people saying: ‘She’s a disgrace’.” Did the abuse affect Katja? “Absolutely, it did,” she says. “I would find myself on rehearsal days looking at playback, focusing on how big my thighs looked instead of my dance form. I have to say, once I shared the horrible comments there was so much support”. She has spoken of dealing with endometriosis and says her weight has always fluctuated. Of the abuse she says: “I have the tools to deal with it, I just needed to reinforce those positive affirmations. And my family were amazing. They just thought it was cool that I was dancing on TV.” Inevitably, given her backstory, we talk for a while about the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the “Ireland is full” protests around the country. She is thoughtfulon the subject. “It’s conflicting,” she says. “I am a young person living in Ireland, I know it’s tough.” “I have a friend coming home from Australia with her boyfriend and they are finding it so hard to find somewhere to live. I understand that people are in a difficult position and when things get hard people look for people to blame. And the easiest targets are the newbies, the immigrants, the people who don’t sound like you or look like you.” [ Manifesting is the perfect religion for our times. But does it work?Opens in new window ] She says she hates “it’s come to that” because she immediately thinks of her parents. “They still have accents, when they talk they don’t sound Irish even though they’ve been here for so long. They are easy targets. I am someone with black skin. I know that just walking around without someone hearing my Dublin accent, I will be judged. “Something could happen to me. So I hate that black and brown people, any people of colour in Ireland, are in danger and have to worry about abusive and racist rhetoric and also physical violence.” The “conflict” she feels on the issue is about the challenges many people in this country face. “I’ve lived in Ireland my whole life. I pay taxes in this country, but I know when the time comes around when I get married and I want to look for a house, it’s going to be incredibly difficult, even though I work hard and I know other people are working hard too.” “People just want a better life for themselves. But at the same time, it’s not the fault of immigrants who are just trying to blend and integrate into a country,” she says. “It’s the fault of a Government that needs to do better. The pressure should lie with the Government to create resources for people who are struggling with the socio-economic situation, who can’t get houses. They need to be the ones to create a solution.” I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family I ask how she feels being asked about this subject. Does it get wearying? “Every time I talk about it, and I’ve talked about it a lot, it always comes with a certain amount of hate. So I’ve become more apprehensive. There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’. They say: ‘You’re a diversity hire’. They say all these crazy things so I’ve drawn back on it a bit”. But does she feel it’s important to speak out? “Yes, especially now seeing the attacks on Indian people, it’s heartbreaking. I grew up with Indian friends in my class and Pakistani friends. They’ve been here for years. And the new people should be welcomed too because at the end of the day we’re citizens of the world. The Irish history of migration in Australia, in Canada and in America is well known and there is never any issue with that. It’s clearly a skin colour issue and that’s what makes me upset.” In 2020, attending a protest against the murder of George Floyd by police in America, she told an Irish Times reporter that watching the footage of Mr Floyd’s death made her think of her father and brother. “My dad has such a gentle soul and to think that someone would look at him and perceive him as violent from the colour of his skin is absolutely outrageous. We’re protesting here for George Floyd but also for every black person who has gone through discrimination.” Now, she says: “My dad is a taxi driver, I get afraid for him when he is out at night because these people seem to have this new-found confidence to be blatantly racist and they think it’s okay to hurt people like that. So I get upset and I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times.” On a more positive note, she’s happy to see things moving, however slowly, in terms of increased representation and participation of people of colour in Irish society. “I feel like it is slowly changing in a natural, unforced way. What you are seeing is the second generation of immigrants growing up and choosing careers like presenting or being make-up artists, there are more of us in the creative industries. “I think traditionally there was a lot of pressure to be, like, a doctor or a lawyer. But we also need to have visual representation in creative spaces too. And I think slowly we’re getting that.” In many ways, she is still the industrious Leaving Cert student, pushing herself forward to the next thing. She’s still manifesting, still dreaming. “I’ve had to back myself and be like: this is what you asked for, what you dreamt of, so work hard, open your ears, learn”. She’ll turn 30 next year. There’s a wedding to plan. What are her latest goals? “I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family. It’s always at the back of my mind, it goes beyond myself. I have dreams of buying a home for my family one day, and of having the life that I always dreamed of in Ireland, especially growing up through struggle,” she says. “It’s made me hyper-ambitious and focused on having security in life. I have a job that really drives me, a job I’m very lucky to say I love.I’ve met amazing people and the dream is just to continue doing something like this. If I can have longevity in this industry, then I’ll be very happy.” Katja Mia presents The Six O’Clock Show with Brian Dowling every weekday on Virgin Media © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: We Are Becoming A Nation Of...: HDFC AMC's Navneet Munot On India's 'Multi-Pronged Growth Model'

The rapid pace of economic reforms by the government, including tax cuts, GST (Goods and Services Tax) reductions and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has created a wave of optimism about India’s growth trajectory, according to Navneet Munot, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC). He lauded the government's economic strategy, describing it as a combination of "policy prudence, agile execution and effective communication" that sets India apart on the global stage. “India has been a nation of savers for generations. What we are doing now is becoming a nation of investors. If you are astute, you would take a long-term view of India. It is going to be a multi-pronged growth model rather than a very narrow set of growth models most of the other countries have seen,” he said during a conversation with NDTV Profit on Friday. He said that India has become 'Atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in its capital markets, while acknowledging the importance of the inflow of foreign funds. “I won't say that we don't need foreign savings. I think our investment needs are humongous. We need more foreign flows for sure. And at some stage, it's likely to come both in the form of FDI as well as in the form of FPI.” He contrasted India's approach with that of major economies like the United States, highlighting a fundamental difference in philosophy. “On one side, you are seeing increasing tariffs and putting more burden on the consumers... On the other side, what India is doing is, I want to give more benefit to the larger section of the society," he said. He described this as the 'Bahujan Hitai, Bahujan Sukhai' (for the welfare and happiness of the masses) philosophy, starkly different from policies that favour tax cuts for the wealthy while imposing tariffs that ultimately hurt consumers. Munot cited recent measures like personal income tax relief, GST rate cuts and RBI’s liquidity injections as steps to stimulate consumption and credit growth. “It is not only about cutting rates and paying less taxes. It's also about like Chanakya said that the government should take taxes the way a butterfly gently takes nectar,” the top executive said. Munot was bullish on India’s potential to produce global-scale asset managers akin to Blackstone or BlackRock. “Several of those businesses are managing hundreds of billions in alternatives and trillions in public markets. Over a period of time, as this economy grows from $4 trillion to $40 trillion in our lifetime, you will see asset managers in India talking about that size,” he said. Highlighting India’s importance for the world, he said, “This is where 18% of humanity is. This is where the youngest population in the world is. We will be the biggest supplier of labour force to the world for the next several decades. So, you have to ensure that you take full advantage of that demographic dividend.” Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company closed 0.44% higher at Rs 5,594 apiece on the NSE, while the benchmark Nifty50 ended 0.03% up at 24,741.

Title: Jio BlackRock CEO: Data-driven approach with fund manager insights sets us apart

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Jio BlackRock Asset Management Company is all set to launch its first actively managed fund, a flexicap fund, on 23 September. The AMC is an equal joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global investment giant BlackRock. What sets it apart from other funds? According to Sid Swaminathan, CEO of Jio BlackRock AMC, it has a data-driven approach using BlackRock’s Aladdin software with insights from human fund managers. The fund house also has the benefit of Jio's large distribution ecosystem, which allows it to focus on direct-only plans for now. In this interview, Swaminathan talks about the fund's plans, AI-driven products and more. Edited excerpts:Can you walk us through the overall plan that you have for unfolding Jio BlackRock AMC? With BlackRock bringing its tech platform, Aladdin, to India, asset managers can do everything in a very scalable, operationally safe manner. We also have our partner Jio, which allows us to access customers at scale in the digital ecosystem. Our platform in BlackRock, systematic active equity (SAE), is a quantitative data-driven AI machine learning approach to equity investing. A computer does all the data crunching for you, and then you have the fund managers who can overlay some specific insights on it. You can then input all of this into Aladdin. Next, run a portfolio-level optimisation using the risk model and an India-specific risk model built for the joint venture to generate a portfolio recommendation. If you aim to outperform a flexicap fund using these insights by X percent annually, with Y amount of risk relative to that benchmark, here is a suggested portfolio. What about your products and their rollout? We have launched three institutional-focused cash funds to start with. We are very happy with the kind of start that we got, and also the retail participation…about 67,000 investors in the first three NFOs since July. We have also looked at the index funds. So again, in a way, bread and butter for BlackRock. The third set of funds in phase one will be more leaning towards the active side, with flexicap as the first one. Some fund houses are more tilted towards growth, and some towards value. Is there an overarching philosophy for you? The overarching philosophy is that it's a data-driven approach. It allows us to use and leverage the data in many ways. For example, for this flexicap fund that we are going to launch, the fund managers will typically look to generate the alpha purely through stock selection. Now the same data can be used to build another fund, which will come later. But instead of just having views on stocks, I may have views on factors. So I could have a growth tilted, or a value tilted fund, or I could do factor rotation…so we have all the insights to do that. Or rather than factors, we can have sectors. So, as a fund house, our philosophy is to be data-driven and then deliver that in differentiated ways to our end customers. Do you have an upper and lower limit to the number of stocks you would have in the fund? Not necessarily. You would expect around 125 to 150 stocks, which is, again, a lot more than you would see in a typical flexicap where it’s probably 30 to 40. But you're never going to see 500 stocks because, again, that's an index fund. You've chosen to take the direct route for distribution. What was the thinking behind this, and how will it pan out? People are becoming increasingly comfortable managing their finances digitally on their phones. Our partnership with Jio, which has access to that ecosystem, gives us a clear understanding that this is the direction we want to pursue. We aim to see how direct digital approaches work. We have the capacity to manufacture at scale, and if we can reach customers and offer them value digitally, that would be excellent. We can always consider growing, expanding, and exploring other options in the future. The ₹24 tax filing product enables users to file their returns digitally. Would it accelerate your growth? A lot of new products are coming online from JioFinance. Yes, like new functionality on the Jio Finance app will help accelerate our growth. Our presence will also accelerate Jio Finance’s growth, because people will get excited by things like the NFO periods going online. We currently have 50 to 55 million unique permanent account numbers (PAN) in the mutual fund space. How large do you think the market can grow? Fifty-five million is a very big number, but in the context of India, it's still very small, right? We have just crossed 20% of AUM (assets under management) as a percentage of GDP. By comparison, the UK is at 80% and the US is at 150%. There can be some short-term blips that we have seen even in the last few weeks, but the overall macro is very sound. Demographics are very positive. Tell us a little about your team Our chief investment officer (CIO), Rishi Kohli, has been involved in the systematic quant investing space in India for many decades. In addition, two dedicated fund managers who previously worked at BlackRock have joined the team. There are also two dealers and a couple of researchers for the equity team. On the fixed income side, we have three fund managers, two dealers, and a couple of researchers. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Business Elon Musk, chief executive officer of SpaceX and Tesla, gestures as he attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, Jun 16, 2023. (Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) WILMINGTON, Delaware: Elon Musk's blow-out US$1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a US$56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law. In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

Loading Unlike the 2018 pay package, this time around Musk will be allowed to use his voting power, which is around 13.5 per cent, according to Friday's security filing. If recent history is a guide, that will lock in approval.Last year, the company's shareholders voted to "ratify" Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Musk's pay package. Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification. In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Musk's US$56 billion compensation are on appeal.In 2018, the company barred Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law.Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges - the law in Texas, where it reincorporated last year."They are completely insulated from a shareholder lawsuit in Texas," said Ann Lipton, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School.Tesla told investors last year in its pitch to approve its move from Delaware to Texas that laws in the two states were "substantially equivalent" and there was no reason to believe shareholders would have weaker litigation rights in Texas.Things, however, changed in May when Texas lawmakers allowed companies to require shareholders to own 3 per cent of a stock before they can sue.Tesla quickly adopted a 3 per cent bylaw. Musk is the only individual shareholder who meets that requirement. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street do as well, but they are passive investors. Other investors could band together to reach the threshold.By contrast, Delaware does not limit who can sue and many lawsuits are brought by investors with tiny stakes and the cases are overseen and funded by a handful of specialised law firms, which is a source of frustration to corporate boards. Richard Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over the 2018 pay package."We believe this bait-and-switch effectively was an effort to pull the wool over shareholders’ eyes," the New York State Comptroller said in a proposal in Friday's proxy statement. The comptroller is asking Tesla shareholders to repeal the 3 per cent threshold at the annual meeting where shareholders will also vote on Musk's pay package. Lipton said if shareholders do not like the pay package proposal, they still have an option. "Sell," she said.

Musk is the only individual shareholder who meets that requirement. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street do as well, but they are passive investors. Other investors could band together to reach the threshold. By contrast, Delaware does not limit who can sue and many lawsuits are brought by investors with tiny stakes and the cases are overseen and funded by a handful of specialised law firms, which is a source of frustration to corporate boards. Richard Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over the 2018 pay package. "We believe this bait-and-switch effectively was an effort to pull the wool over shareholders’ eyes," the New York State Comptroller said in a proposal in Friday's proxy statement. The comptroller is asking Tesla shareholders to repeal the 3 per cent threshold at the annual meeting where shareholders will also vote on Musk's pay package. Lipton said if shareholders do not like the pay package proposal, they still have an option. "Sell," she said.

By Ross Kerber, Dawn Kopecki, Simon Jessop and Arsheeya Bajwa NEW YORK -Tesla's $1 trillion, 10-year pay package to retain CEO Elon Musk is likely to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in November even though the amount is staggering. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. Earlier on Friday, the automaker's board approved what it called "A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO" that sets out lofty earnings and valuation targets – awarding Musk millions of shares over the next decade if he hits them. It immediately gives Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock worth more than $31 billion as of intraday trading on Friday that vests over the next two years, as well as more control over the company. His total 2025 compensation package is worth north of $113 billion, executive compensation research firm Equilar has estimated. “The pay package, which makes a big bet on the future of robots, may see shareholder support," said Taufiq Rahim, a SpaceX investor and principal at 2040 Advisory. "But it raises larger social questions about the outsized gains going to relatively few capital holders, which is likely not sustainable and will face public pressures.” The package is designed to keep Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. The compensation committee started negotiating Musk's pay package in February, it said, meeting with lawyers 37 times and directly with Musk 10 times over seven months. Certain items were non-negotiable for the idiosyncratic CEO: he wanted 25% of the company, to control Tesla's future direction and to be fully compensated for a 2018 pay package that was hung up in litigation. THREATS TO LEAVE Musk threatened to leave more than once, and the board worried the company's AI talent would follow him out the door, it said in the filing. The $31 billion in restricted shares, which he cannot sell for at least five years, is partial payback for a $56 billion 2018 pay plan that a Delaware court voided last year. If Musk wins in court within a certain time frame, he will not receive the one-time payment "so there can be no 'double dip,'" the board said. "Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue his other interests and leave Tesla if he did not receive such assurance," the board said. SHAREHOLDER PROVAL The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO, Equilar said. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar Research Director Courtney Yu told Reuters. "While it may seem outlandish now, shareholders will get tremendous value out of it if Elon Musk is successful." None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said on Friday how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with a number of union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. "We urge shareholders to reject Musk’s money grab, take away the Tesla board’s rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Musk, who currently controls close to 13% of the company, would own 25% if the plan is approved, so long as he hits his performance targets and sticks around for at least seven more years. Payable over 12 tranches after hitting certain milestones, the ultimate prize could make Tesla the most valuable company in the world with an aspirational market capitalization of $8.5 trillion, making it worth more than Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Alphabet combined, today, the board noted. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. “This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Musk was worth that much. “He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk’s actions outside of Tesla," he said. 'PICK A NUMBER' Tesla’s shares closed up 3.6% at $350.84 on Friday. They are down 13% for 2025, although they have recovered from their lows. Investors worry about its deteriorating electric vehicle business and rising foreign competition. “One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible," Coatsworth said. "Surely Musk should be fighting for his job, not Tesla’s board fighting to keep him?" This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp says U.S. labor workers won’t lose their jobs to AI—‘it’s not true’

Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. As fears swirl that American manufacturing workers and skilled laborers may soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and robots, Alex Karp, CEO of the AI and data analytics software company Palantir Technologies, hopes to change the narrative. “It’s not true, and in fact, it’s kind of the opposite,” Karp said in an interview with Fortune Thursday at the company’s commercial customer conference, AIPCon, where Palantir customers showcased how they were using the company’s software platform and generative AI within their own businesses. The primary danger of AI in this country, says Karp, is that workers don’t understand that AI will actually help them in their roles—and it will hardly replace them. “Silicon Valley’s done an immensely crappy job of explaining that,” he said. “If you’re in manufacturing, in any capacity: You’re on the assembly line, you maintain a complicated machine—you have any kind of skilled labor job—the way we do AI will actually make your job more valuable and make you more valuable. But currently you would think—just roaming around the country, and if you listen to the AI narratives coming out of Silicon Valley—that all these people are going to lose their jobs tomorrow.” Karp made these comments the day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August jobs report, which showcased a climbing unemployment rate and stagnating hiring figures, reigniting fears of whether AI is at all responsible for the broader slowdown. There has been limited data thus far suggesting that generative AI is to blame for the slowing jobs market—or even job cuts for that matter—though a recent ADP hiring report offered a rare suggestion that AI may be one of several factors influencing hiring sentiment. Some executives, including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, have cited the efficiency gains of AI for layoffs at their companies, and others, like Ford CEO Jim Farley and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, have made lofty predictions about how AI is on track to replace jobs in the future. Most of these projections have been centered around white collar roles, in particular, versus manufacturing or skilled labor positions. Karp, who has a PhD in neoclassical social theory and a reputation for being outspoken and contrarian on many issues, argues that fears of AI eliminating skilled labor jobs are unfounded—and he’s committed to “correcting” the public perception. Earlier this week, Palantir launched “Working Intelligence: The AI Optimism Project,” a quasi-public information and marketing campaign centered around artificial intelligence in the workplace. The project has begun with a series of short blog posts featuring Palantir’s customers and their opinions on AI, as well as a “manifesto” that takes aim at both the “doomers” and “pacifiers” of AI. “Doomers fear, and pacifiers welcome, a future of conformity: a world in which AI flattens human difference. Silicon Valley is already selling such bland, dumbed-down slop,” the manifesto declares, arguing that the true power of AI is not to standardize but to “supercharge” workers. Jordan Hirsch, who is spearheading the new project at Palantir, said that there are approximately 20 people working on it and that they plan to launch a corresponding podcast. While Palantir has an obvious commercial interest in dispelling public fears about AI, Karp framed his commitment to the project as something important for society. Fears about job replacement will “feed a kind of weird populism based on a notion that’s not true—that’s going to make the factions on the right and left much, much, much more powerful based on something that’s not true,” he said. “I think correcting that—but not just by saying platitudes, but actually showing how this works, is one of the most important things we have to get on top of.” Karp said he planned to invest “lots of energy and money” into the AI Optimism Project. When asked how much money, he said he didn’t know yet, but that “we have a lot of money, and it’s one of my biggest priorities.” Palantir has seen enormous growth within the commercial side of its business in the last two years, largely due to the artificial intelligence product it released in 2023, called “AIP.” Palantir’s revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time last quarter. And while Palantir only joined the S&P 500 last year, it now ranks as one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to its soaring stock price. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Lululemon Stock Plunges; Broadcom Charges Higher

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest employment report. The data showed the U.S. added fewer-than-expected jobs in August, and a downward revision to earlier estimates revealed the economy shed jobs in June, the first month of losses since 2020. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on the final day of the holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow was down 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a fractional loss of less than 0.1%. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Friday, plummeting 18.6%. The maker of athletic apparel posted softer-than-expected same-store sales growth for its fiscal second quarter and trimmed its full-year revenue guidance, pointing to tariff impacts and sluggish U.S. sales. Jefferies analysts suggested Lululemon could face even tougher conditions ahead, citing competitive pressures and doubts about the company's pipeline of new designs. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 9.4% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., plans to release a report suggesting a link between autism and pregnant women's use of Tylenol. The popular over-the-counter painkiller is made by Kenvue subsidiary McNeil Consumer Healthcare. A Kenvue spokesperson on Friday contested the claims allegedly made by the report. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares tumbled 6.6% after Seaport Research downgraded the chipmaker's stock to "hold" from "buy." Analysts pointed to signs of slowing demand for AMD's artificial intelligence accelerators, and noted it could become difficult for the company to meet lofty expectations. Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged 9.4%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected sales and adjusted profit for its fiscal third quarter. Demand for AI semiconductors boosted Broadcom's performance, with AI revenue rising 63% year-over-year. The company also said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new customer, which reports later suggested was OpenAI. Shares of pool equipment supplier Pool Corp. (POOL) advanced 5.5% after Friday's weak jobs report cemented the case for an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this month. Expectations of a rate cut caused the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage rates, to sink to its lowest level since April. Elevated mortgage rates have kept the U.S. housing market in a deep freeze for the last three years, which has dragged on the businesses of homebuilders and home goods producers like Pool. Tesla (TSLA) proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth roughly $1 trillion. Reaching that amount would require the electric vehicle maker's CEO and world's richest person to achieve certain performance targets, including helping Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion and a total of 20 million vehicle deliveries. Negotiations around Musk's compensation have grown contentious in the past, and shareholders are set to vote on the proposed package on Nov. 6. Tesla stock added 3.7% Friday.

Title: Stocks wobble as Wall Street wrangles with whether the job market is too weak

U.S. stocks wobbled lower on Friday as Wall Street questioned whether the U.S. job market has slowed by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help the economy, or by so much that a downturn may be on the way. After rising to an early gain, the S&P 500 erased it and fell 0.3% below the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, after swinging between an early gain of nearly 150 points and a loss of 400. The Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%. The action was more decisive in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. The government also said that earlier estimates for June and July overstated hiring by 21,000 jobs. The disappointing numbers follow last month’s discouraging jobs update, along with other lackluster reports in intervening weeks, and traders are now betting on a 100% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept. 17, according to data from CME Group. Investors love such cuts because they can give a kickstart to the economy, but the Fed has held off on them because they can also give inflation more fuel. So far this year, the Fed has been more worried about the potential of inflation worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market. But Friday’s job numbers could push the Fed to consider cutting rates in two weeks by a steeper amount than usual, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “This week has been a story of a slowing labor market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Strong hiring for health care jobs had been helping to support the overall market, “but with it now showing some tangible signs of decline, the foundation underneath the labor market seems to be cracking,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. While the data on the job market is disappointing, it’s still not so weak that it’s screaming a recession is here, and the U.S. economy is continuing to grow. A big question for investors is whether the job market can remain in a balance where it’s not so strong that it prevents cuts to interest rates but also not so weak that the economy falls off. Uncertainty about that helped lead to Friday’s swings in the stock market. Wall Street needs things to go as hoped because it already sent stock prices to records amid expectations for a Goldilocks scenario where interest rates ease, and the economy keeps chugging along. On Wall Street, Friday’s heaviest weight was Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the face of the artificial-intelligence boom. It’s been contending with criticism that its stock price charged too high, too fast and became too expensive following Wall Street’s rush into AI, and it fell 2.7%. Lululemon dropped 18.6% after the yoga and athletic gear maker’s revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald pointed to disappointing results from its U.S. operation, while Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said Lululemon is facing “industrywide challenges, including higher tariff rates.” Still, more stocks rose on Wall Street than fell. Leading the way was Broadcom, which climbed 9.4% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Hock Tan said customers are continuing to invest strongly in AI chips. Tesla rose 3.6% after proposing a payout package that could reach $1 trillion for its CEO, Elon Musk, if the electric vehicle company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years. Smith & Wesson Brands jumped 6.5% after the gun maker delivered better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Mark Smith said it saw good demand for new products in what’s traditionally a slow season for sales of firearms. All told, the S&P 500 fell 20.58 points to 6,481.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 220.43 to 45,400.86, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 7.31 to 21,700.39.. In stock markets abroad, indexes in Europe lost early gains to turn lower with Wall Street. That followed strength across much of Asia. The Nikkei 225 rallied 1% in Tokyo after data showed accelerating growth in earnings for Japanese workers. Chinese markets rebounded following three days of decline, with indexes rising more than 1% in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.09% from 4.17% late Thursday and from 4.28% on Tuesday. That’s a notable move for the bond market and could mean lower interest rates are coming for mortgages and other loans.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=165290&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Trillions are the new billions. Electric-vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) on Friday unveiled a proposed compensation package for Elon Musk that could grow to roughly $1 trillion if the CEO hits performance targets and collects all of the shares awarded. Between the new plan and shares he owns now, the estimated value of Musk's implied total stake in Tesla would exceed $2 trillion, cementing his status as the world's wealthiest human. Musk has to hit what the company called "Mars-shot milestones"—longer than a moonshot, to be sure—to be compensated in full, according to a company filing. In addition to market-cap milestones attached to the plan's share-award tranches, the company would have to meet operational milestones that start with product delivery targets and end with adjusted Ebitda hurdles. The first pair of milestones requires Tesla's market capitalization to reach and sustain $2 trillion and the company to deliver a cumulative total of 20 million vehicles. Market-cap targets jump by $500 billion with every tranche, with the last target being $8.5 trillion—more than double the current market cap of Nvidia (NVDA), the most valuable company in the world. Operational milestones include 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation as well as logging $400 billion in adjusted Ebitda over four consecutive quarters. The last two of the 12 tranche awards would only be granted after Musk sets a succession plan approved by Tesla. And he would have to stay at the company for at least 7 1/2 years. The plan, on which shareholders are scheduled to vote Nov. 6, could stir up drama if shareholder reactions are anything like receptions to past pay packages. In 2018, a group of Tesla investors balked when shareholders approved a 10-year performance-based pay plan that would award Musk a then-estimated $56 billion. A Delaware judge struck down the deal twice, and Tesla's board recently approved an interim stock award of 96 million shares of restricted stock. If Musk is awarded the original 2018 package, the interim award would be forfeited. In order for Musk to own his earned awards outlined in the 2025 pay package, he has to pay the equivalent of Tesla's closing price on Sept. 3, or roughly $334 per share in cash or stock, after he hits the 7 1/2-year mark, at the earliest, or after 10 years. During negotiations that stretched across 10 meetings, Musk threatened to "pursue his other interests" and leave Tesla if he wasn't assured he'd be compensated for his past services as outlined under the 2018 pay package and at least a 25% voting interest, according to the proxy filing, up from about 20% now. "The Committee believes the cost to Tesla and its shareholders is well worth it in light of the tremendous value that would be created, and strides in product development that would be realized, if the 2025 CEO Performance Award is fully achieved," Tesla's filing said. For now, investors appear pleased. Tesla shares rose almost 3% as of Friday afternoon to a recent $348.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person in the world and he's all set to get richer. Musk, whose current net worth is close to $378 billion, was the first person to have a net worth of over $400 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Now, a proposed new pay package could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. The company's shares were trading 8% lower year-to-date as of Sept. 5, 2025. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk was vocal in his support for Trump, Forbes reported, joining him on the campaign trail and becoming Trump's second largest donor by putting $118 million into America PAC, which Musk created. He also served on Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency till May this year. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionnaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. Tesla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

Title: Paramount’s new CEO tells employees to return to office full-time or quit ahead of layoffs

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Paramount CEO David Ellison, in one of his first companywide memos, demanded staff come back to the office five days a week or else find a new job. Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, became CEO of Paramount after its long-stalled $8 billion merger with Skydance was finalized last month. Since then, he has warned employees of efficiency changes, and said in an email that the new return-to-office mandate, which will be pushed out in phases starting January 2026, will “unlock Paramount’s full potential,” Fox News reported. But the mandate came with a not-so-subtle deadline: New York– or Los Angeles–based employees have until Sept. 15 to decide whether they will comply or take a buyout. The company will announce plans for employees based outside New York or L.A. in 2026, Ellison said in the email. “As I said during our town hall, some of the most formative moments of my life happened in rooms where I was a fly on the wall, listening and learning. I’ve never seen that happen on Zoom,” he wrote, according to Fox News. Paramount is the latest company to end COVID-era remote work policies as power shifts back to employers in the context of an increasingly worrying economic environment. Over the past year, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart have all told employees to get back to the office. At times these mandates have been slow to stick or have led to important losses, including for Walmart, which saw its Sam’s Club chief technology officer resign rather than move to the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. The return-to-office mandate comes as Paramount is reportedly preparing to lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 employees in November now that the merger is approved and resolved. As of December 2024, the company had 18,600 employees, Variety reported. Paramount did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Paramount’s revenues for the first half of the year fell 3% year over year to $14 billion from $14.5 billion. The company reported a slight uptick in overall revenue for the second quarter, but saw a 6% decline in its cash cow TV media segment, which includes broadcast operations like CBS and cable networks, including Showtime and Nickelodeon. Its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Paramount+, increased 15% year over year thanks to a subscription boost and price increases. Post-merger, Paramount has sought deals to spur growth, especially for its streaming services. The company in July signed a $1.5 billion landmark deal to host the animated comedy South Park on Comedy Central and Paramount+ for five years. The company also signed a three-year deal with Legendary Entertainment to market and distribute its theatrical films globally, starting with the new Street Fighter film set to release next year. At the same time, executives previously said $2 billion in potential cost cuts could be realized under the combined company. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: After 100 Years, Trillion-Dollar Fund Manager Wellington Wants You to Know Its Name

The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds and building its brand with retail investors. September 5, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co. is a rarity in the investment world: a fund manager with more than $1 trillion of assets and almost zero brand recognition. Not for long. The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is now moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds. Wellington is spending big to hire from bulge-bracket banks and alternative investment firms, adding dozens of private markets professionals to build a unit of about 40 people. It’s also hustling to build a brand with retail investors, many of whom have never heard of the $1.3 trillion firm. It’s a big change for a money manager that for decades didn’t care about what the world thought, as long as its big institutional clients were happy. Among its recent hires, Wellington recruited a head of private investments capital formation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., poached a team from Pacific Investment Management Co. to expand in private credit and hired Christina Kopec Rooney from Goldman’s asset management arm to head its nascent push into the US wealth market. It even partnered with private equity giant Blackstone Inc. and Vanguard Group to launch hybrid funds for retail investors. Related:Has the ‘Democratization’ of Alts Gone Too Far? In perhaps its most radical shift, Wellington – housed across 19 floors in Boston’s Atlantic Wharf – has done the previously unthinkable: It hired a public relations team. “It’s unfamiliar,” said Steve Klar, Wellington’s president. It’s a sign of the times. Tectonic shifts in asset management are pushing the firm, and others like it, out of their comfort zone. Traditional asset managers under pressure from outflows and fee compression in their mutual funds are striving to break into the more lucrative private markets to boost their margins and assets before their competitors gain all the spoils. Rivals such as Franklin Resources Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and even the likes of industry giants BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are diving in headfirst, buying alternative investment firms or partnering with private equity shops to launch funds. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will purchase as much as $1 billion of T. Rowe Price shares as the two team up to sell private-market products. Wellington’s Chief Executive Officer Jean Hynes said in an interview at the firm’s headquarters that despite relying mostly on stickier institutional money, she knows the firm isn’t immune to the intense pressures reshaping the asset management industry. Client migration to cheap passive funds has pushed the industry’s average fee down to just 0.3% from about 1% two decades ago, according to Morningstar Inc. (Vanguard — Wellington’s largest client, accounting for about a third of the firm’s assets — charges an average fee of 0.07%.) Related:Baird Takes Stake in Sagard; Will Distribute its Products to Wealth Clients Wellington argues it’s especially well positioned among its peers to go big on private markets. The firm’s executives say its private partnership structure – with no shareholders to answer to – gives the firm control, allowing it to play the long game and retain its tight-knit culture. Michael Carmen, a partner at Wellington who’s behind the expansion, says that an ambitious 10-year plan kicked off in 2023 to grow the private markets unit that now manages only $9.7 billion. He’s even interviewing candidates to start a secondaries business to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, one of the hottest areas in alternative investing. Its new emphasis on higher-fee alternatives is already shifting internal power dynamics at a time when different teams inside the firm are fighting for resources. Some who work in the more traditional, lower-fee parts of the business say that as private markets become more prominent at the firm, the rewards are going disproportionately to employees who work in that business, according to people familiar with their thinking. Related:iCapital, Tangible to Launch Digital Marketplace for Sale of Secondary Stakes Klar, one of three people who determines partner compensation, said this is not the case. If the privates business does well, then all the partners at Wellington benefit, he said. While most of Wellington’s assets are in privately held accounts, for which information isn’t available, data for its public funds offer a glimpse into the industry’s struggles. About 160 funds with combined assets of a half-trillion dollars managed or sub-advised by the firm recorded outflows of more than $130 billion between 2022 and the end of June 2025, according to Morningstar. Wellington’s growing hedge fund franchise, set up in the mid-1990s, now manages about $20 billion in long-short strategies. While that’s a tiny slice of the firm’s overall assets, it accounts for an outsize share of the firm’s profits. To attract and retain the talent needed to generate the above-market returns many alternative investment clients expect, the firm has also had to utilize other routes to a big payday besides its classic and lengthy path to becoming a partner. Alternative investment portfolio staffers are compensated in line with market standards, Klar said. For those deemed to have a big impact on the firm’s financial performance, there’s always the position of managing director — a role that allows staff to share in some of the profits without having been named partner. Wellington’s push into wealth is also forcing the firm to rethink another closely guarded aspect of its culture: its secrecy. For decades, the asset manager was so content with having a name known only among pensions and endowments that it made a point of not having a public profile. But Wellington often took its privacy to extremes. A former employee recalls that it was so hard to find information about the firm when he joined 20 years ago that he wasn’t sure it was a legitimate company until he had his first interview. People at bank wealth channels — which play a vital role in selling Wellington’s products to individuals — have said that everyday investors don’t know the firm and, for the funds to sell, the brand needs to be bigger. And so, Wellington has reluctantly begun hiring its first public relations people in recent years. It’s learning, slowly but surely, how to put itself out there. This isn’t the first time Wellington has had to reinvent itself. The firm, founded in 1928, faced an existential crisis 50 years ago after a disastrous run in equities nearly left it for dead. Its roughly two dozen partners at the time mortgaged their houses and used the money to delist the firm from the stock market. It later fired Jack Bogle, in 1974, after disagreements with Wellington partners over investment strategy and personnel matters. Bogle went on to found Vanguard, and Wellington agreed to run active strategies for his new outfit. Vanguard eventually became a household name synonymous with the 401(k) market, while Wellington built its brand with institutional clients and shunned the spotlight. In the ensuing years Wellington became less Boston-centric, opened offices and launched funds in Europe and Asia and abandoned a fixation on US equities to start investing in international stocks and, more recently, in bonds. (Today, about 40% of its assets are in fixed income.) As it looks to its next century, the firm is stretching further beyond the status quo. As part of its partnership with Blackstone and Vanguard, Wellington now oversees around 100 people globally working on the project. Terry Burgess, one of the firm’s top three decision makers, is in charge of the effort. Klar said that beyond courting retail investors, the firm’s alts expansion — and attracting talent for that business — is another reason Wellington wants its name out there. As it peddles its brand, Wellington now records podcasts, produces videos with weekly market updates, and churns out regular press releases. It’s a far cry for a firm that, until recently, never even had a publicist on the payroll.

Title: Google's $3.5B Fine Signals End of Big Tech's Free Pass

Google's regulatory reckoning has finally arrivedâand it's expensive. The tech giant is facing a historic $3.5 billion fine from European authorities for breaking antitrust laws, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. With courts finding Google liable for maintaining monopoly power and global antitrust enforcement fines hitting $6.7 billion in 2024âmore than double 2023's totalâwe're witnessing a fundamental shift in how regulators approach Big Tech monopolies. PRO TIP: This isn't just about one company getting fined. The coordinated global crackdown on Google represents the end of Big Tech's "move fast and break things" era. For consumers and competitors, this could mean real change in how we access information and digital services. Let's break down the scale of Google's legal troubles. In April 2025, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google liable for 'willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power' through its integration of advertising tools. The court found that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing open-web digital advertising markets for over 15 years, manipulating ad-tech auctions and stifling competition. Here's where it gets interesting: Google's dominance isn't just about search. The company commands more than 90% of Android app downloads and processes over 24 billion updates per week through its Play Store. That level of control means Google decides which developers succeed, what users can access, and how much everyone pays. The EU's approach has been particularly aggressive. The Digital Markets Act designated Google as a 'gatekeeper', imposing strict data governance rules. The EU can fine companies up to 10% of their global annual revenue for DMA violations, which translates to a potential $35 billion maximum penalty based on Google's 2024 earnings. The genius of Google's strategyâand what makes it so problematicâlies in how its 2008 DoubleClick acquisition created the infrastructure for today's violations. By purchasing the dominant ad-serving platform, Google didn't just buy a competitor; it acquired the tools to control every step of the digital advertising process. This acquisition enabled Google to implement the DMA-violating practices and Play Store restrictions that courts are now finding illegalâturning what appeared to be routine business expansion into the foundation of systematic market manipulation. Google's advertising empire is where the real money flowsâand where regulators are focusing their firepower. These ad tech tools account for roughly $95 billion in annual revenue, approximately 15% of Alphabet's total revenue. But here's the kicker: Google's advertising technologies generate about $30 billion annually and form the backbone of internet economics. The DOJ's case reveals how Google systematically eliminated competition. The DOJ has demanded a structural divestiture of Google's ad tech business, including the sale of DFP and AdX. Internal evidence shows Google takes a 20 percent commission on transactions carried out through its ad exchange, while Google's DFP ad server has enjoyed a market share of 84 to 90 per cent over the last ten years. The court's findings are damning. Google engaged in unlawful conduct to maintain monopolies by limiting publisher ad server access and requiring publishers who wanted access to AdX to use DFP. This isn't just market dominanceâit's market manipulation. Bottom line: Google essentially became the auctioneer, the auction house, and the payment processor all at once. When competitors tried to offer better deals or more innovative solutions, Google made it increasingly difficult for them to participate. Internal documents revealed that Google deliberately designed its systems to favor its own servicesâand when publishers tried to resist these changes, Google knew they had no choice but to comply or lose access to essential advertising revenue. The European Commission isn't playing games. Abuse of dominance decisions by The European Commission accounted for over 75% of the overall global fine volume in 2024. Beyond Google, the EC set its third ever highest fine with its EUR1.84 billion fine on Apple and fined Meta EUR792.7 million for abusing its dominance. Google's European troubles run deep. The EU's top court upheld a record-breaking â¬2.4 billion fine for anti-competitive promotion of its Shopping service. Google was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favour its own comparison shopping service, presenting search results with attractive visual information while relegating competitors to basic links. The pattern is clear: Google has accumulated penalty exposure of more than 8 billion euros by the EU for various antitrust violations. This isn't just about one caseâit's systematic regulatory pushback against Google's market practices. What makes Europe's approach revolutionary is its shift from traditional antitrust thinking. Unlike previous cases that focused on consumer harm through higher prices, the EU's Digital Markets Act targets "gatekeeper behavior" that stifles innovation and choice. In the Shopping case, the court found that Google's conduct was discriminatory and did not fall within the scope of competition on the merits. Translation: Google wasn't winning because it was betterâit was winning by rigging the game, and that's enough for enforcement action regardless of immediate consumer impact. The stakes couldn't be higher. The remedies trial will decide whether Google must divest its ad tech assets or adopt behavioral changes, with the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust showdown with Google entering its final phase this fall. Google isn't going down without a fight. The company has opposed the breakup, warning of 'seismic disruptions' to its ad tech ecosystem and proposes behavioral adjustments, such as ending UPR and sharing bid data with competitors. But UBS warned in 2025 that a forced breakup of Google's ad-tech business could trigger a 30% stock plunge. The ripple effects extend far beyond Google. A breakup could create opportunities for rivals like Meta, TikTok, and independent ad tech firms, while the case mirrors EU antitrust actions against Google and could influence ongoing U.S. cases targeting Amazon and Meta. Here's what makes Google's predicament particularly challenging: the company has already tried to make concessions, proposing alternative billing options and even considering partial divestitures to appease European regulators. But publishers rejected the proposal, viewing these measures as insufficient half-steps that fail to address the fundamental structural problems. With the Biden and Trump administrations both supporting this case, there's rare bipartisan consensus that meaningful action is requiredâmaking it nearly impossible for Google to wait out the regulatory storm. Bottom line: We're witnessing the end of Big Tech's regulatory free pass. The Biden and Trump administrations both have supported this case, showing rare bipartisan cooperation in prosecuting tech monopolies. The current batch of significant antitrust cases working through the courts could eventually provide the U.S. Supreme Court an opportunity to reshape antitrust jurisprudence for the digital era. Google's $3.5 billion fine isn't just a penaltyâit's a signal that the era of unchecked tech dominance is ending. With global antitrust enforcement reaching unprecedented levels and regulators worldwide coordinating their efforts, the question isn't whether Google will face more consequences, but how dramatically the entire tech landscape will reshape in response. What makes this regulatory moment truly unprecedented is the coordinated international response. European, American, and other regulators are no longer working in isolationâthey're sharing intelligence, coordinating enforcement strategies, and learning from each other's legal frameworks. This makes it impossible for tech giants to play regulatory arbitrage or simply absorb fines as a cost of doing business. When the EU develops new approaches like the Digital Markets Act's "gatekeeper" framework, U.S. courts take notice, creating a global convergence toward tougher tech oversight. The implications cascade beyond Google to the entire interconnected web of Big Tech dominance. Apple faces its own antitrust challenges, Meta confronts divestiture demands around Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon faces scrutiny over its treatment of third-party sellers. Unlike previous enforcement efforts that tackled companies in isolation, regulators now understand how these platforms reinforce each other's market power and are addressing the ecosystem systematically. For users, developers, and competitors who've been squeezed by Google's dominance, this regulatory reckoning might finally level the playing field. If these enforcement actions deliver on their promise, we could see genuine choice in search engines, real competition in digital advertising, and innovation from companies that no longer face impossible barriers to entry. The real test will be whether these legal victories translate into tangible changes in how we experience and interact with digital platforms. The era of "move fast and break things" is over.

Title: Using The Blog Module vs Divi 5’s Loop Builder

The #1 WordPress Theme & Visual Page Builder Harness the Power of Divi With Any Theme The Best Theme for Bloggers and Online Publications The Ultimate Email Opt-In Plugin for WordPress The Best Way To Promote Social Sharing Forgot Your Username or Password? Posted on September 5, 2025 by Christopher Morris Leave a Comment The Blog Module is Divi’s built-in feed generator that works out of the box. It gives you a fast way to list posts with toggles for titles, images, excerpts, and metadata. Divi 5’s new Loop Builder takes a different approach. You design the item with any modules, then feed dynamic content into it. Both tools display looped content, yet each shines in different scenarios. Knowing when to use which saves time and prevents frustration. Let’s compare the two. Subscribe To Our Youtube Channel This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to the concept of a Loop Builder: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The Blog Module is built for recognizable blog patterns. It assumes common elements and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how blog posts work in WordPress. Every post shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as blog content. These shared characteristics include: The Blog Module was designed with traditional posts in mind. Titles tell you what the post covers. Featured images add visual draw. Excerpts preview the content. Metadata says who wrote it and when. Divi’s Blog Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in querying tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the author but keep the date, show the image, or skip the excerpt. Small decisions yield quick results. The Blog Module can display normal posts and properly register Custom Post Types. The Blog Module works fine when the CPT mirrors standard post fields. It becomes limiting when you need true custom data. So, a Team Member CPT works when things are kept simple. The Blog Module handles this situation with ease. Limitations appear with any fields that default posts don’t share. Social links, certifications, or years of experience won’t appear in the Blog Module because it was built for the standard fields found on default WordPress blog posts. The module has no toggle for those custom fields. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module packs elements inside a fixed structure in a fixed order. You can’t reorder the title and image unless you use custom CSS. You can manage the layout of each blog card via flexbox or block, but child items (the cards) don’t have Sizing settings for child flexbox control (like shrink to fit or grow to fill). ﻿ The Blog Module is excellent and fast to use for standard card layouts. If you get a bit of a creative bug, you might find yourself looking for something more custom. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying dynamic content. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, Loop Builder allows you to construct your content display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Blog Module. With the Blog Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. Loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop,” it repeats itself for each matching result. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, and Button modules. You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct token. Divi’s UI makes this pretty simple. The Image points to the featured image. The Heading points to the title. The Button links to the post URL. This modular approach gives you structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can also add two text blocks for two custom fields. This way, you can build the card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a couple of quick scenarios. We’ll keep the pattern and swap the fields. Let’s use the card design from our previous example and see how it can be adapted using custom post types and custom fields. First, build a custom Loop for standard blog posts. Use the stand Posts ‘post type’ with the standard fields for title, category, publish date, and feature image. Map each to the respective module in your design. These use standard post fields but are arranged in a unique layout. We can do something similar for some simple real estate listings. Using the same card layout, we can populate content from our custom post type with the heading assigned to the property title, Text Modules assigned to bedrooms, bathrooms, and property description, and a Button bound to the property listing URL. The end result looks like our blog card, but uses the Loop Builder’s ability to assign content from Custom Fields and Custom Post Types. All this talk of CPTs, how do you make those? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here. Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset also create fields that Loop Builder can read. Use what fits your budget, experience, and stack. A note for real estate websites: You’ll want to use a dedicated plugin that pulls listings from an IDX into WordPress as a CPT. That way, you have fresh data and minimal manual work (no one wants to manually enter properties every morning). Flexbox pairs naturally with the Loop Builder. You can use it at two levels for a clean, responsive structure without custom CSS. First, style the outer loop container. Select the loop parent container. Turn on Flex layout. Set direction to Row. Enable Wrap if you want multiple flex-rows. Set Gap to control spacing between items. Then, adjust the sizing of the child container where your loop sits using the Sizing options. You can create a responsive and attractive layout for your looped elements between the container Flex controls and the child Flex controls. Second, style the inner card layout. Select the root container inside the loop item (the Column or Group Module, for instance). In Layout options, set Flex direction to Row if you want some elements side by side. Set the width of the image module to take up about half the space in the container. Let the text area (in this case, a Group container with various modules inside) fill the rest (Grow to Fill in Group Module Sizing options). You can arrange the various containers or modules however you want. You aren’t locked into a preconfigured layout. Here we put the Title in the left Group and set the right group to Flex Column. This gives us a subtle yet unique change of layout. There really is no shortage of possibilities. ﻿﻿ This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Blog Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Blog Module when content follows standard post patterns. Title, featured image, excerpt, and basic meta are its sweet spot. Basic news sites, company updates, and simple portfolios qualify. Visitors expect a conventional layout, and you may want a reliable solution with minimal setup. With the Blog Module, you can ship a working feed in minutes. Fewer moving parts also mean fewer chances to break things (or get confused). Non-technical users who might still be lost on the concept of a “loop” will still heavily rely on the Blog Module. It’s a great tool and should absolutely be used. Use Loop Builder when you need fields that posts don’t have, or when your card structure doesn’t match a stock pattern. Ecommerce, real estate, and education are typical industries that tend to need more customization. Each needs details that live in custom fields. When you are working with more content or more types of content, layouts tend to need more flexibility. Use Loop Builder when content relationships get complex. You may need to mix post types in one view and show content from repeaters. Divi’s Blog Module is still the fastest way to ship a standard feed. The Loop Builder unlocks custom cards, custom fields, and repeaters. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design that you have in mind, while the Blog Module has some limitations there. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the job. Divi 5 is coming together and is more powerful (and stable) than ever.

U.S. equities turned lower at midday following the government's weaker-than-expected August employment report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were down. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the fashion athletic apparel retailer reported lower-than-anticipated comparable store sales on soft demand in the U.S., and cut its guidance on higher costs relating to new tariffs and the removal of the de minimus exemption for lower-priced imports. Shares of Copart (CPRT) dipped when the online auto auctioneer missed revenue estimates as vehicle sales declined. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell on a downgrade from Seaport Research, which pointed to concerns about the chipmaker's AI accelerator business. Broadcom (AVGO) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the software maker posted better-than-anticipated results and said it had a new $10 billion customer. Speculation is that the customer is AI giant OpenAI. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose when the electric vehicle maker offered CEO Elon Musk a 10-year pay package that could be worth $1 trillion. Docusign (DOCU) shares jumped when the electronic signature software firm beat profit and sales estimates and raised its outlook as larger customers were using its AI products. Oil futures sank. Gold prices advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: What’s up with… Ciena, Telecom Italia, Starlink in India
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ciena-telecom-italia-starlink-in-india-53773/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:47:16Z
Full Content:
Sep 5, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ciena’s on a roll; Telecom Italia’s new largest shareholder is Italy’s state-owned postal service; Elon Musk’s Starlink is prepping for its satellite broadband launch in India; and more! As we reported on Thursday, Ciena is benefitting from the rising investments needed in network capacity as cloud, video and, in particular, AI-related data volumes increase, as it reported a 29.4% year-on-year increase in revenues to $1.22bn for its fiscal third quarter that ended on 2 August. In the company’s earnings presentation, the optical, routing and automation software technology vendor noted that in addition to that stellar growth continuing into its fiscal fourth quarter, it is also set to extend into its fiscal year 2026, which runs (roughly) November 2025 to the end of October 2026. The company expects full year revenues for fiscal 2026 to be 17% higher than in fiscal 2025 (which ends in late October), way higher than the 10% growth that financial analysts had been expecting. That growth is being driven by increasing investments from the hyperscalers, big tech giants/datacentre operators, such as Meta, and major US telcos, such as Verizon, AT&T and Lumen Technologies. Fiscal 2025 full year revenues are set to come in at around $4.7bn, so that puts Ciena’s expectation for its fiscal 2026 sales at $5.5bn. No wonder the vendor’s share price jumped by an incredible 23.3% on Thursday to end the day at $116.92. Italy’s state-owned postal service Poste Italiane has been given unconditional approval by the country’s antitrust authority, the AGCM (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato), to acquire a 15% stake in national telco Telecom Italia (TIM) from French media giant Vivendi. The deal was first announced in late March. According to Poste Italiane, “the AGCM resolved to approve the transaction unconditionally and, therefore, not to initiate an investigation, as it does not significantly impede effective competition in the affected markets and does not result in the creation or strengthening of a dominant position”. As a result of the purchase, Poste Italiane is now Telecom Italia’s largest single shareholder, with a total stake of 24.81%. In August, Telecom Italia reported revenues of €6.6bn, up 2.7%, for the first six months of the year, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) up 5% to €1.7bn. Starlink, Elon Musk’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation that is having a major impact on the global broadband services and direct-to-cell (D2C) communications sectors, has received a provisional spectrum licence from India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) so it can trial its satellite broadband services in the country. The New India Express reports that Starlink is setting up ground stations at 10 locations across India as well as a main operations hub in Mumbai. The operator now has to prove it can comply with India’s security rules during a number of tests and trials: If it is successful it will be awarded a full licence, though the DoT noted that full licence pricing and terms are still to be finalised. The expectation, though, is that Starlink will proceed without any major issues and soon become an influential player in India’s broadband services sector, not least because it has already struck partnerships with India’s two largest telcos, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. US long-distance operator Lumen Technologies is to use Palantir Technologies’ Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to help transform its business. “Lumen is transforming from traditional telecom into a next-generation technology infrastructure company leveraging its physical fiber network, digitally powered platform and connected ecosystem,” noted Palantir in this announcement. “To meet customers’ evolving multicloud, AI-ready needs, Lumen is collaborating with Palantir across its operations, finance and technology functions to unlock new value. Palantir’s Foundry and AIP aim to streamline workflows, accelerate decision-making, and simplify complex legacy operations – from customer service and compliance reporting to the decommissioning of legacy telecom infrastructure and migration of products into modernised ecosystems. By surfacing actionable insights and enabling AI-assisted decision-making, the software is driving faster execution and improved operational efficiency, empowering Lumen to transform its network and services with speed,” added Palantir. Dave Ward, chief technology and product officer of Lumen Technologies, stated: “As Lumen powers the backbone of the AI economy, we’re determined to make our own operations intelligent and efficient, just like the networks we deliver to our customers. Working with Palantir allows us to harness AI to accelerate our modernisation efforts and deliver the network and services our customers need in the AI era.” – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: Broadcom CEO Stands Alongside Steve Jobs In Memorability, Says Analyst As He Hikes Target Price To $415

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The AI narrative is alive and kicking vigorously. If anyone were still in doubt, the recent pristine earnings print from Broadcom (AVGO) should have laid to rest any lingering consternation on that count. Broadcom, which has gained particular prominence in recent years for designing AI-specific ASICs and accelerators, reported a 22 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its fiscal Q3 2025 to $15.95 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $15.83 billion. It also beat consensus expectations for EPS by reporting a $1.69 print. So far this year, Broadcom has launched the Tomahawk Ultra networking chip, which is an Ethernet switch chip designed for intra-data-center connectivity, and a next-gen Jericho networking chip, which is a purpose-built Ethernet router for large-scale, distributed AI clusters. Critically, Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue surged by 63 percent year-over-year to $5.2 billion. And, completing its trifecta of beats, the company raised its guidance for Q4, now projecting total revenue of $17.4 billion and AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that Melius Research's Ben Reitzes just termed Broadcom's recent earnings call as "the most bullish and memorable call" he can remember, hiking Broadcom's stock price target to $415 per share. Do note that Broadcom's surging AI semiconductor revenues remain at the heart of this nascent bullish shock, delivered with a crispness only someone of Tan's experience could have managed. Elsewhere, we came to know that OpenAI could spend $10 billion on designing an ASIC with Broadcom next year, as per a report by Financial Times. This aligns with a new $10 billion contract that Broadcom's CEO revealed during this week's earnings call. Goldman Sachs commented on this development in the following words: "We believe the most significant development was Broadcom's announcement that it has converted another new custom silicon customer focused on inference, which is expected to help drive "material" upside to management's prior expectation of AI Semiconductor revenue growth of ~60% in 2026."

I'm always shocked when I remember Amazon got started way back in 1994. For more than a quarter century, this company was run by itsthe same founder, Jeff Bezos, who built it into America's second-largest employer. He pursued a dizzying array of products, services, businesses, moonshots, and side projects. Then, in the midst of a global pandemic, he stepped aside and Andy Jassy took over as CEO. Jassy was suddenly responsible for more than 1.5 million employees located all over the globe while COVID-19 spread. And he was taking the reins from a boss who'd stamped his unique approach on almost everything at Amazon. Daunting stuff. It's been over four years since then, and Jassy has finally made Amazon his own. That's according to an exclusive inside look at how this new CEO is changing the world's largest e-commerce and cloud company. Superstar reporter Eugene Kim spent many weeks on this project. If you're an Amazon employee, or you're thinking of working there, this is a must-read. Here are some highlights, but go read the whole thing: Costs Before Culture: When Jassy stepped into the top job in 2021, Amazon was ballooning from pandemic-era growth while suffering massive losses. The new CEO couldn't tackle cultural challenges until he first stabilized Amazon's cost structure. That meant big layoffs, project cuts, and tightening the belt at every level. "Arena" Leadership: Some leaders aren't mincing words. One high-level email obtained by Kim bluntly told managers to "step into the arena" and meet higher standards or leave. It's a tone that underscores a harder-edged, performance-first culture. From Spreading Bets to Big Bets: Jassy is rethinking how Amazon innovates. Unlike Bezos, who encouraged wide bets across hundreds of projects, Jassy is concentrating resources on a smaller number of "big bets" with clearer paths to profitability. The Petty Edge of Frugality: The company's legendary frugality now extends to the fine print. Some employees must track how much of a $50 phone allowance is actually work-related, with reimbursements adjusted accordingly. Owners, not employees: Jassy wants staff to think like owners. Would they spend their own money on this project, or that work trip? He sees Amazon as "the world's biggest startup," with a sharper, leaner culture. That's testing how far today's workforce is willing to go along for the ride. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com. Jump to

Title: Marvell: MRVL Stock To $140?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/marvell-mrvl-stock-to-140/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T12:35:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been one of the tech sectors more puzzling stories this year. Despite delivering record second quarter results and showing signs of building a niche for itself in AI infrastructure, the stock has slumped 43% year-to-date - including a 15% slide in the last week - after management issued a cautious outlook for its data center business. Shares now trade at $64 apiece. The sell-off stems from lumpy orders for Marvell’s custom AI accelerators, but such quarterly volatility is fairly common in this market. Delays in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) next-generation AI chips amid design changes could be pushing back demand for Marvell’s silicon, while Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS which relies on Marvell for its Trainium AI chips has been losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Overall, these issues appear more like timing-related volatility than structural problems. Marvell’s long-term opportunity in AI looks compelling, given not just its custom accelerators, but also its optical connectivity chips. Could this underappreciated AI player be set up for a sharp rebound? We outline a case that could see the stock more than double to almost $140 per share from current levels. Separately, see important current market context – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Marvell's Long Growth Runway In AI Marvell’s push into the AI market began with its high-speed interconnect solutions for data centers. These optical and electrical interconnects are essential for moving the enormous volumes of data generated by AI and machine learning workloads. Since these workloads rely on massive parallel processing and ultra-fast data transfer, they place heavy demands on existing infrastructure, creating a need for the advanced connectivity technologies that Marvell provides. The bigger growth driver has been application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for AI. Unlike general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are customized for the requirements of individual customers such as hyperscalers, delivering better cost efficiency, lower power consumption, and superior performance. This could play to Marvell’s advantage in the long-run. Big tech is in the middle of an unprecedented AI spending spree. Amazon is expected to spend up to $105 billion on capex in 2025, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are forecast to spend as much as $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion respectively, much of it earmarked for AI infrastructure such as GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, investors will eventually begin to prioritize returns on AI investments and companies could become more judicious with spending. Big companies could seek alternatives to Nvidia, and Marvell’s specialized models could be a top choice for hyperscalers. Also see: What’s happening with SMCI stock? There are signs that the most compute-intensive phase of AI training may begin to level off, with the industry’s focus shifting toward inference - the application of trained models to new data in real time and at massive scale. Inference is lighter per task but occurs continuously across millions of users and applications. This transition plays directly into Marvell’s strengths, as it opens the door for specialized, power-efficient solutions beyond the high-end GPUs that dominate training. The market could potentially shift from large-scale general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized ones, potentially helping more niche players like Marvell who offer tailored products that optimize costs and performance for specific applications. The 2x Math Coming back to the stock's potential, the math works like this. Marvell trades at about 40x trailing earnings and about 23x estimated FY'26 adjusted earnings. This is well below peers such as AMD and Nvidia. AMD trades at about 40x forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 38x. This indicates that Marvell’s multiple is not stretched. Revenue Growth: Marvell Technology has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 10.9% over the last 3 years, but this does not capture the big AI surge the company is witnessing. Over the most recent quarter, net revenue came in at a record $2.0 billion, up 58% compared to the same period last year. Marvell revenue stood at about $5.77 billion in FY'25 and the metric is likely to grow by about 41% to $8.14 billion per consensus estimates. Looking ahead, if revenues expand at an average rate of 30% each year over FY'27 and FY'28, driven by AI demand, Marvell's top line could scale to about $13.7 billion by FY'28. Adjusted margins: Coming to margins, Non-GAAP net income was $585.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Adjusted net margins stood at 28% over the first six months of the year. As scale improves and fixed costs are absorbed, margins are expected to gradually move higher. For perspective, Nvidia now posts margins of over 50%. If Marvell’s adjusted net margins rise to about 30%, this would translate into adjusted net income of over $4.1 billion, roughly 3x FY'25 numbers. Earnings multiple: Now if income rises so much, the trailing multiple, which stands at about 40x would fall to a third of its value or about 13x, right? Probably not. As Marvell scales up its business profitably, investors might continue to assign a high multiple of about 30x, about 25% below current levels. This would translate into a market cap of roughly $120 billion, or a little over 2x from current levels. See MRVL Valuation Ratios What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three - as long as MRVL sustains its revenue expansion trajectory and steadily improves margins, the stock price could respond similarly. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 24/7 Market News: Everything’s Bigger in Texas… Especially the Sunset Amphitheaters (NYSE: VENU)

September 05, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, confirms that VENU (NYSE American: VENU), a trailblazer in premium hospitality and live entertainment, officially broke ground on its $300 million Sunset Amphitheater on June 13, 2025, in McKinney, Texas. According to Founder, Chairman, and CEO J.W. Roth, the Sunset VENU will be “the most luxurious fully seated, multi-configuration, all-season venue in history.” The amphitheater will feature a canopied roof, wind walls, LuxeFire Suites, and a members-only Aikman Club, in collaboration with NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, Founder of EIGHT Elite Light Beer. Nestled at the center of the amphitheater, the Aikman Club offers one-of-a-kind views, premium seating, and high-end amenities. With a capacity of up to 20,000 guests, more than double the 8,000-seat Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, the Sunset Amphitheater is positioned as a premier destination for live entertainment. Institutional VIP Momentum Institutional investors have been quick to recognize VENU’s value creation. Over the last month: Analyst Support Strengthens the Story Wall Street coverage is building alongside institutional ownership. Cenorium Capital recently reiterated its Strong Buy rating with a $22 price target, while Northland Securities raised its target from $15 to $17, maintaining its Buy rating. Analysts point to VENU’s amphitheater model, accelerating municipal pipeline, and diversified funding approach as key drivers of long-term value. National Recognition & Strategic Partnerships VENU has been recognized nationally by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Denver Post, Billboard, VenuesNow, and Variety for its innovative and disruptive approach to live entertainment. Through strategic partnerships with industry leaders, such as AEG Presents, VENU continues to shape the future of the entertainment landscape. Municipalities are also lining up. Economic impact studies from the McKinney Sunset Amphitheater project, which is expected to generate over $3 billion in impact within the first decade, have catalyzed community interest nationwide. “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area,” said Roth. “To accelerate these agreements, we’ve partnered with industry leader Ryan, who is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter.

Title: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17%

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. American Bitcoin, a mining company tied to US President Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., wrapped up its first day of trading on the Nasdaq with sharp swings but still managed to finish 16.75% higher at just over $8. After-hours trading pushed the stock up another 6% to $8.50, reports confirmed. Trading opened with a rush. The newly rebranded company, formed through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP), jumped as high as $13.21 from Gryphon’s previous close of $6.90, a 90% surge. That early momentum collapsed quickly, sending the stock down to $6.70 in the afternoon before it recovered part of the loss. Nasdaq halted trading five times due to extreme volatility. Despite the erratic moves, Bloomberg estimated Eric Trump’s 7.5% stake at roughly $548 million by the end of the session. His fortune is now tied directly to how American Bitcoin performs in the market. According to Eric Trump, the company will not only mine Bitcoin but also buy it when conditions make more sense. He described the approach as switching “to whichever is better at the time.” The company’s existing treasury already holds 2,443 BTC, making it the 25th-largest stash among public companies. With Bitcoin trading above $112,000, that holding is worth about $275 million. Eric Trump emphasized that the business will aim to maximize shareholder value by balancing mining output and market purchases: “We’re going to harness daily mining to the fullest, but we can also go out and purchase Bitcoin to support the treasury,” the presidential son said. The launch has stirred questions about whether American Bitcoin benefits from President Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Eric Trump dismissed criticism that his family is profiting directly from political ties, saying his father has “nothing to do with this business.” The American Bitcoin debut came just days after another Trump-linked venture. Tokens for World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a separate crypto project involving President Trump and his sons, were listed on exchanges earlier in the week. WLFI’s performance has so far been weak, dropping 30% from its debut price and losing another 7% in the last 24 hours to about 21 cents, based on CoinMarketCap data. A company tied to the Trumps owns nearly a quarter of all WLFI tokens, estimated at $4.6 billion in value. While WLFI struggles to gain traction, American Bitcoin’s opening has given the Trump family another high-profile position in the crypto sector. Whether the stock can maintain its momentum after a chaotic debut remains uncertain, but Eric Trump called the launch “an unbelievable day” and insisted “the floodgates are just starting to open.” Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Broadcom (AVGO) is helping ChatGPT maker OpenAI design and make its first-ever AI chip, according to reports. The partnership would help Broadcom challenge Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance as an AI leader. Shares in Broadcom, which last night posted fiscal third-quarter results that topped estimates Thursday on record revenue, are soaring 15% in early trading Friday, lifted by the results and the OpenAI news. Speculation about a big new customer the company disclosed last night without identifying it also helped the stock. The Financial Times, citing "people familiar with the matter," said that OpenAI was the customer that committed to $10 billion in orders Broadcom CEO Hock Tan referred to during last night's conference call. Citi analysts in a note also said they believe OpenAI was that customer. Broadcom and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI will initially use the new chip for its own internal purposes, the FT reported, with shipments beginning next year, according to the FT and Bloomberg. OpenAI, which currently uses chips from Nvidia, is following the path of other big tech firms like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) in moving to create AI chips in-house. Broadcom's quarterly results are the latest to show sustained demand for AI hardware following earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) last week, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) last month. The company's shares have gained more than 50% so far this year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: AI stock euphoria: Is this another 2000 dot-com bust in the making?

'Making Money' host Charles Payne discusses what's causing the market to pull back. If you were investing in the late 1990s, you’ll remember the euphoria of the dot-com boom. Anything with a ".com" at the end of its name could raise millions in capital and see its stock price double or triple overnight. Investors believed the internet would change everything – which, to be fair, it eventually did. But between 2000 and 2002, that dream turned into a nightmare when the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Today, with artificial intelligence leading headlines and fueling investor enthusiasm, many people are wondering if we are about to experience another dot-com bust? AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. ( / iStock) The Parallels to the Late ’90s There are some undeniable similarities between the two periods. Back then, internet companies with little more than a business plan and a website were valued at astronomical levels. Today, AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. The narrative is powerful, and capital is rushing in. Recently, Palantir which is a fan favorite stock right now, traded with a PE of 522! TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA Another similarity is market concentration. In 1999, Cisco, Intel, Sun Microsystems and AOL were the poster children of the boom. Fast-forward to today, and the so-called "Magnificent 7" – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – make up more than 30% of the entire S&P 500. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is supposed to be a diversified index of America’s top companies. But if just a handful of stocks are driving most of the returns, that creates real risks if those companies stumble. The market capitalization of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks is almost 40% of the entire S&P 500 Index. The Differences That Matter While the echoes of the dot-com era are loud, the differences are even louder. UBS managing director and senior portfolio manager Jason Katz weighs in on artificial intelligence in the U.S. markets and cryptocurrencies' performance in the stock market. First, valuations are stretched but not nearly as absurd as 1999. Back then, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 was over 25 – an eye-popping figure for the time. Many internet stocks had no earnings at all, making traditional valuation metrics meaningless. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE Today, the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio hovers around 21. That’s elevated compared to the long-term average of 15-16, but nowhere near dot-com territory. And crucially, the tech giants dominating today’s index are highly profitable businesses generating enormous cash flow. The only area where we see these dot-com patterns popping up are in AI stocks. Slap the two letters AI next to a stock and it’s a feeding frenzy for investors. Second, the companies leading the charge aren’t speculative startups with unproven business models. Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are trillion-dollar companies with fortress balance sheets and decades of consistent profitability. Nvidia – the crown jewel of the AI trade – sells real products with extraordinary demand. Unlike Pets.com, Webvan.com and eToys (remember them?), these firms have sustainable revenue streams and durable competitive advantages. Is AI the New Dot-Com? There’s no doubt that AI feels frothy. Just as investors in the late 1990s believed every business would be transformed by the internet, many now believe AI will reshape every corner of the economy. Some of this optimism is justified. Essex Investment Management CO-CEO Nancy Prial reveals the factors that are driving market breadth improvement on 'Making Money.' GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The internet did change the way we live our lives today. AI has the potential to boost productivity, reduce costs and create entirely new industries. But in the short term, markets almost always overestimate the speed of adoption and AI companies start up so fast that many are bound to fail. That’s where the risk lies: not in whether AI will change the world, but in how quickly investors think it will happen. History tells us that transformative technologies often go through hype cycles. We thought by now, people wouldn’t still be writing checks but still 50% of Americans wrote at least one check over the past 12 months. There will be winners, but there will also be plenty of losers along the way. Why This Isn’t 2000 Despite the hype, I don’t believe we’re headed for a repeat of the dot-com crash. Here’s why: Fitz-Gerald Group Chief Investment Officer Keith Fitz-Gerald argues Tesla is an A.I. stock and explains why Palantir can hit $100 per share by the end of the year on 'Varney & Co.' CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Will there be volatility? Absolutely. Some AI-driven stocks are priced for perfection and will correct when reality falls short of expectations. But a wholesale collapse of the market like we saw from 2000 to 2002 is unlikely. The better comparison might be the railroad boom of the 1800s. Railroads transformed the economy, and many companies failed along the way. But the infrastructure they created powered America’s growth for more than a century. AI may follow the same path – messy in the early years, but ultimately world-changing.

Title: Tesla proposes Elon Musk pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:47:25Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Elon Musk, already the world’s richest person, could become the first trillionaire after the Tesla board unveiled a massive new pay package for its CEO to keep his focus on the troubled EV maker. The package would grant him additional shares of Tesla stock if the company is able to grow far beyond its current value, with a market capitalization far greater than any company has ever approached. Musk’s previous pay package, which added significantly to his massive wealth, also laid out ambitious growth plans that once appeared to be a reach – but which Tesla proved able to reach easily. The new pay package could grant Musk 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock. Those shares would be be worth $143.5 billion at today’s stock value. But Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The company stock would need to reach an overall value of $8.5 trillion for Musk to get all the shares, significantly above the current market capitalization of $1.1 trillion Those 423.7 million new shares that Musk would get under this package would be worth close to $1 trillion should the company hit the increased valuation targets spelled out in Friday’s proxy statement. If Tesla shares are able to reach the $8.5 billion market capitalization value, it could become the most valuable company ever. It would be worth roughly double the current market value of Nvidia (NVDA), the current most-valuable company on the market. Tesla is already the most valuable automaker by a large margin, even though legacy automakers, like second-most valuable automaker Toyota, sell far more vehicles and now make more profits. The company’s proxy statement that laid out Musk’s payment plan also included a shareholder proposal that Tesla take a stake in privately-held xAI, the artificial intelligence company that Musk also owns. That could help Elon Musk further consolidate his growing business empire. XAI recently purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk bought for $44 billion of his own money in 2022. The company did not take a position for or against that shareholder proposal, which does not give any details of how large a stake Tesla should take in xAI, and what price. But any such investment could further enrich Tesla since Musk is the primary owner of xAI. Musk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla shares, worth $139 billion at Thursday’s closing price. That stake, along with his stakes in xAI, rocket company SpaceX, and several other companies he has started and runs, have made him the richest person on the planet, worth $378 billion according to Bloomberg’s billionaire tracker. He currently has options to buy an additional 304 million shares of Tesla, but a judge in Delaware has twice struck down that 2018 pay package that granted him those options as illegal. Those rulings came despite overwhelming approval by Tesla shareholders – twice. The company again has tried to grant those options to Musk this year, and adding in those options, he now owns 18% of the company’s shares. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value to a record-high price for its shares between election day and mid-December 2024, as investors bet that his close ties to President Donald Trump would be a boon for Tesla. But as Tesla faced protests and dropping sales and falling profits in backlash to those ties (before he had a falling out with Trump), all those things resulted in Telsa’s stock losing those gains. The shares have recovered some of those losses, but they are still down 26% from the December peak. Still, Musk and his fans on Wall Street have insisted the company is well positioned to grow even larger and more successful in the future. He has continued to predict that his plans for self-driving cars – including a robotaxi service – will create massive profits and value for shareholders. The robotaxis would provide rides to passengers andalso allow Tesla owners to rent out their cars for driverless rides when not in use. Musk has also promised a line of humanoid robots that could bring in even more sales than Tesla’s car business. “It’s a big pay package but Tesla needs to keep its biggest asset in Musk as CEO,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN Friday. Ives is one of the bigger Tesla bulls on Wall Street. “In this AI era Musk now will drive its next leg of growth,” Ives added. “The Board had a $1 trillion dollar decision and made the right one.” The board’s proxy statement spoke of the importance of keeping Musk focused on Tesla going forward. In addition to his many business interests, he remains active in politics, despite his falling out with President Trump. He has announced plans to form a third political party. Tesla, in its proxy statement, warned that it needed to incentivize Musk to focus his attention on growing the company. It said that during the negotiations on the pay package, “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.” The board said it “believes that Mr. Musk singularly possesses the leadership characteristics necessary to transform Tesla and realize its long-term mission at an unparalleled level.” But the company said it is also making plans for life after Elon Musk, saying it is already working on succession plans. And it said that one of the terms of the employment package that Musk must meet to receive the final 70 million shares of stock is that he needs to have “developed a framework for Chief Executive Officer succession.” “The board regularly discusses management succession planning and leadership development,” said the proxy statement. It said those succession plans are “for both sudden, unanticipated events, in addition to longer-term planned succession for its executives.” It said it “believes that management has developed a robust pipeline of seasoned leadership talent within Tesla,” and that is also looking at possible external talent. Musk does not receive a cash salary from Tesla. All of his compensation comes from Tesla shares and options he has been granted in the past. Since there is still an ongoing court fight over the 304 million options, Musk has not received any compensation for nearly a decade, since a 2012 pay package made its last disbursement of options to him in 2017. But not all tech billionaires receive additional stock options or grants as compensation, instead benefiting from the increased valuations of their existing stakes in their companies. That includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook. Both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively. Musk is on record saying it’s important that he needs to control at least 25% of Tesla shares. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” That need for control is what’s behind this pay package, said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an investment firm and one of the early investors in Tesla. “This is all about Musk being scared about being kicked out of Tesla because he only owns 13%,” said Gerber, who has sold almost his entire stake in Tesla. Gerber said he also has problems with the size of the proposed pay package. “If he hits them (the financial and market share targets) then in some ways it (the pay package) is warranted,” Gerber said. “But I think it goes back to what level of greed can you reach in a modern society that’s enough.” If Musk and his fans are right, Musk would become far wealthier even without any additional shares of Tesla stock. His current holdings of 410 million Tesla shares, even without the disputed 304 million options, would be worth nearly $1 trillion more than today’s valuation, should Tesla’s market cap rise to $8.5 billion. But Musk won’t get any of the shares of stock until the company raises its market cap to $2 trillion, or nearly twice as valuable as it is today. And he would have to meet at least one of a number of ambitious operational and financial goals, such as having a million robots in operation or getting its adjusted operating income up to $50 billion, which would be well above the record $19.2 billion it earned on that basis in 2022, let alone the $16.6 billion it made last year. But to achieve those targets, it would have to start doing the things Musk is promising in terms of self-driving vehicles and its robotaxi. And that would mean meeting grand claims from a man and company that have often fallen short of their promises. Tesla critics say that the stock has become grossly overvalued because of Wall Street’s willingness to buy into Musk’s vision of the future in terms of AI, self-driving vehicles and robots, despite its failures to deliver on past promises along those lines. “Elon Musk has been saying since 2014 ‘we will have a fully autonomous car next year.’ It hasn’t happened, but that promise has been valued in the billions by Wall Street,” said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the harsher critics of Tesla. “Elon Musk is a master manipulator. He’s been able to keep the stock elevated. The reason the board is paying him is he’s willing to say things that other CEOs aren’t willing to say or get away with.” And some critics, such as Gerber, say another problem with the package is that it will lead Musk and Tesla to pursue and promise the kind of goals that will lift its stock price, more than it will get him to focus on fixing the problems facing its EV business. Tesla is facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers. BYD, one of those Chinese automakers, is poised to pass Tesla for the most EV sales worldwide, even though it is not available for sale in the United States. US law also recently removed the billions of dollars in penalties that traditional automakers have had to pay if their gas-powered vehicles exceed emissions rules. The way that they avoided those payments in the past was by buying regulatory credits from an EV maker like Tesla. But the payments that brought billions in revenue to Tesla will now vanish. Johnson said that Tesla’s stock price is unlikely to hit the ambitious targets laid out in this Musk pay package due to the problems it faces. “Things are going to get worse for them, not better,” said Johnson. “Is Tesla going to go to $8 trillion? Abso-f**king-lutely not.” Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were up about 5% in early trading on the news. This story has been updated with additional context and reporting.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/nvidia-stock-to-fall-50-as-ai-cycle-turns/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has indisputably led the AI boom. Its GPUs are considered the gold standard for training extensive AI models, resulting in sales growth from $27 billion in FY'23 to an anticipated $200 billion this fiscal year. In addition to selling the highest performance chips, the company's CUDA software ecosystem has effectively retained customers. While Nvidia is expected to continue its reign as the leader in AI hardware for years ahead, its stock valuation of nearly 40x forward earnings signifies not only its leadership but also expectations of ongoing, multi-year growth. This renders it vulnerable: even a slight decrease in demand or a structural shift in the AI lifecycle – from focusing on training workloads to inference – could undermine investor confidence and cause significant declines. Historical events highlight this risk – following the Covid-era surge in GPU demand for gaming and cryptocurrency, inflation and reduced demand led Nvidia shares to plummet almost 66% from peak to trough, in contrast to a mere 25% decline for the S&P 500. This is important with current market context – see S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%?. Nvidia’s volatility suggests a similar drop could occur if the current AI growth phase slows. Of course, if you are looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio (HQ). It has consistently outperformed its benchmark that includes all 3: S&P 500, Russell, and S&P Mid-Cap indexes—and has achieved returns surpassing 91% since its inception, as evident in HQ performance metrics. Over the past two years, companies have invested vast resources into developing AI models. Training these enormous models usually requires a concentrated effort that demands significant computing power, with Nvidia being the largest beneficiary, as its GPUs are widely seen as the fastest and most efficient for these operations. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. Incremental performance improvements are waning as models become larger, while access to high-quality training data is becoming a limiting factor – much of what is readily available online has already been utilized in current models. Collectively, these factors imply that the most demanding phase of AI training might start to plateau. Adding to the uncertainty, the economics of the GPU market remains challenging, as numerous Nvidia customers continue to struggle to yield significant returns on their substantial AI investments. Despite that, Nvidia stock has been strong - see NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to examine how the stock has bounced back from sharp dips in the past. In contrast, inference involves applying trained models to new data in real-time and at scale. It is less intensive per task but occurs continually across millions of users and applications. As AI evolves, a larger portion of value creation could shift from training to inference. The challenge for Nvidia is that its growth has been primarily linked to training, where its high-end GPUs have a stronghold. Inference presents an opportunity for more mid-performance and cost-effective chip alternatives, as well as specialized offerings. Here’s a glimpse at some of the main competitors in the inference sector. AMD has notably trailed Nvidia during the initial phase of AI development, but it could become a significant competitor to Nvidia in inference. Its chips are becoming increasingly competitive in performance while providing cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premier GPUs. Many are likely to choose older Nvidia models or budget-friendly alternatives such as AMD’s (NASDAQ:AMD) MI series, which delivers solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. See How AMD stock surges to $330. ASICs or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits are also gaining momentum. Unlike GPUs, which are flexible and programmable, ASICs are designed for a specific task, making them more cost- and power-efficient for inference workloads. The cryptocurrency sector offers a precedent: Bitcoin mining began with GPUs but swiftly transitioned to ASICs once scale and efficiency became vital. A similar trend could emerge in AI inference. Two companies likely to benefit from this shift are Marvell and Broadcom, both of which possess expertise in creating custom silicon for hyperscalers. U.S. Big Tech players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet, and Meta are all designing AI chips. Amazon has focused on training-oriented chips, Meta began with inference and is expanding into training, while Google accommodates both with its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the goal is not necessarily to outdo Nvidia in the marketplace but to reduce costs, enhance bargaining power, and manage supply for their expansive cloud ecosystems. Over time, this translates to diminished incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. In Q2, Nvidia reported that just two of its clients accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue, and it is highly plausible that these were major U.S. tech firms. This concentration makes Nvidia significantly more susceptible. If hyperscalers increasingly turn to proprietary silicon, even minor changes in purchasing behavior could lead to substantial revenue implications. Chinese Players In China, firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, and Huawei are enhancing their AI chip initiatives. Reports last week indicated that Alibaba plans to introduce a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to facilitate inference at scale using its own technology stack, and to ensure a reliable supply of semiconductors in light of U.S. export restrictions. Currently, Nvidia’s GPUs are still anticipated to serve as the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training operations, but inference is poised to become the long-term growth driver for the firm. Nvidia’s position is still robust due to its established ecosystem, substantial R&D investments, and supremacy in training. However, inference is expected to become the next growth engine for AI hardware, and the competitive landscape is significantly more crowded. Even a slight dip in growth could heavily impact the stock, considering how much future performance is already factored in. For investors, the critical question is whether Nvidia’s growth trajectory can align with the elevated expectations set by the market. If the economics of inference prove less advantageous than those of training, the stock could still face a “valuation reset” despite retaining its technological leadership. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, inclusive of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Original Coupon Deal Yes. If you like this - go for it. IMHO one of several 'Big House' champagnes that I actively avoid. This trades on the reputation of their very superior vintage wines - but is much debased. Good for ship launches. Not so good for drinking (for enjoyment). My 2 cents worth… Is these brands betters? Louis Roederer Champagne Cristal Rose Vinotheque 2002 Well, Louis Roederer is the 'brand'. And yes it is better. AND you don't need to buy anything outrageously expensive (like Cristal). But if you're opening… :-) roederer NV is $90-$100, double the price of the moet in this deal. think moët just gets a bad wrap because they seem to make it in such large volumes and it’s readily available and affordable so makes champagne less of a prestige product, but some companies have access to the fruit and manage to turn out good product per $, dr loosen makes great riesling in volumes, guigal makes great rhone in volume, some companies have the resources and the process. Now you gotta give us your list! I found Cazanove vintage (2007, and '17 more recently) a great value buy when LL specials overlapped with good cashback rates. Hit ~$35 / bottle a few times per year but much rarer to see those prices now, usually $70+. Dangerous! What happens if people go out and buy what I like? Prices will rise and I'll cry/cry more! agree, usually buy as gift/congrats as it looks good. not bad drop just better imo. I don’t disagree, but it’s good to have some for people that think “champagne” is automatically better than sparkling wine, and also turn their nose up at names they don’t know. I’m not whipping out a twice as expensive bottle of Billecart Salmon for them. If you can find from Tassie - Lost Farm Cuvée Vintage 2017- ~39 per bottle. As someone who has provided many a Bolly discount here, I want to say that the Tassie drops are just as good, and offer an amazing value. Arras, Jansz, Taltarni are all fab. I also found the Gratien & Myer cremant at Dan's unbeatable at $17 but its out of stock… Would love to hear other tips!! champagne wise i like charles or n from dans, often at $50 mark, if just something with take-away, jacob’s creek trilogy at $12 - $14 as it has all 3 grape varieties, not many other australian sparkling have pinot meunier in them, also jacob’s creek reserve, it’s pinot chardonnay but bottle fermented if you only have $12-$14 , up market sparkling like the tassie mumm it’s my $35 fav along with pirrie but the mumm is often out of stock, champagne go to, like bollinger and roederer , but even on special it’s it’s a 2 bottle a year treat now. FYI $272.15 for a 6-bottles of Moet & Chandon Brut NV Champagne at Dan Murphys using the SEPT10 coupon combined with the instant Dan Murphys 5% egift cards from places like RACQ. So ~$45 per bottle. Mega, thank you ❤️ Or just buy one bottle for $49 after using the $10 discount https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/922583 Code not working for me anymore, getting an error message on payment saying that it’s expired. $171.20 for 2 Moet and 4 Chandon (2 for $50), 10% off then $25 both auto-applied at checkout, bubbles sorted, thanks OP :) Other recommendations also appreciated but no ex-First Choice anywhere convenient and Dan with stocks quite a hike :( All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

September 04, 2025 16:40 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery.

On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: NY Fed Survey Sees Minimal Impact on Jobs From AI Adoption

Highlights Layoffs tied to AI remain rare, with only 1% of service firms reporting job cuts due to AI, and none among manufacturers, though some anticipate layoffs ahead. About 12% of service firms scaled back hiring due to AI, but similar shares are adding AI-skilled workers, suggesting offsets rather than mass job loss. Nearly half of firms plan to retrain employees to use AI, with Fed and PYMNTS surveys showing workers see AI more as a tool for skill augmentation than replacement. Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping hiring decisions in the U.S. labor market, but fears of widespread job loss remain unfounded, according to new regional surveys from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Δ The August regional business surveys found a sharp uptick in AI use among firms in the New York, Northern New Jersey region, with 40% of service firms reported using AI in the past six months, up from 25% this time last year. For the next six months, 44% expect to use AI. Service firms are those in finance, healthcare, business services, hospitality, retail and other industries outside of manufacturing and the public sector. Among manufacturers, usage rose from 16% to 26% over the year. For the next six months, 33% expect to use AI. The New York Fed surveys excluded companies that only used AI to search for information. But instead of expanded AI adoption leading to widespread job losses — OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI could reduce up to 70% of jobs — the New York Fed found that only 1% of service firms have cut jobs due to layoffs, with manufacturers not reducing their workforces at all. “Layoffs have been almost nonexistent due to AI use,” Richard Deitz, economic policy advisor at the New York Fed, said during a press call Thursday (Sept. 4) to discuss the surveys. Moreover, manufacturers do not plan to cut jobs as a result of using AI over the next six months. For service firms, 13% plan to reduce their job count in the near future. The strongest labor impact is on reduced hiring. Among service firms, 12% said they hired fewer people in the past six months due to AI use. For the next six months, 23% of service firms said they would do so. Among manufacturers, none reduced hiring in the last six months but 8% plan to do so in the next half year. But plans to reduce hiring are offset by increased hiring of workers with AI know-how: 11% of service firms and 7% of manufacturers. For the next six months, 12% and 14% of service firms and manufacturers plan to hire more AI-adept workers, respectively. Also, workers were more likely to be retrained than let go. A third of service firms and 14% of manufacturers are retraining the existing workforce. For the next six months, 47% of service firms and manufacturers plan to do so. “When we’re looking at the implied economy-wide impacts from our surveys, these impacts are likely to be really limited,” Deitz said. “For those that have a job, they are actually more likely to be retrained than replaced by an AI, which is a clear positive for workers. Moreover, AI has created job opportunities for workers who are skilled in AI use.” A PYMNTS Intelligence report had a similar finding: While most workers surveyed agreed that artificial intelligence poses a systemic risk of job displacement, nearly two-thirds do not believe their jobs are at risk. Moreover, a higher percentage of respondents across occupations see AI as augmenting their skills instead of taking away their jobs. Read more: GenAI: A Generational Look At AI Usage And Attitudes The biggest impact is on job seekers, where AI “likely made it a bit harder” to get employment now and in the near future, Deitz said. The reduced hiring more often affects workers with a college degree. Recent Stanford University research supports the finding that AI is making it harder for young workers to get jobs, especially in fields where generative AI tools can automate tasks. These include software developers, receptionists, translators and customer service agents. The PYMNTS report showed that while 82% of workers who use AI at least weekly say it increases productivity, millennials and Gen Z workers are more likely than older generations to worry that AI can take away their jobs. Overall, 54% are concerned about the technology’s impact on jobs. In the New York Fed surveys, paid AI services were gaining traction: About half of service firms that use AI reported paying for tools, up 16 percentage points from a year earlier. For manufacturers, 46% of manufacturers do so, up from 7% last year. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity AI all have free or paid tiers. The top three uses for AI were the same for both types of businesses, differing only in ranking. For service firms, the top use case is to search for information (54%), followed by marketing and advertising, and business or predictive analytics. For manufacturers, marketing and advertising was at the top (61%), followed by search for information and business or predictive analytics. The findings suggest AI’s effects on jobs are both overstated and underestimated — overstated in the sense that layoffs remain minimal, but underestimated in that hiring is already shifting in ways that make it harder for new entrants and some college graduates to land positions. Still, expected job changes will likely be affected by economic conditions. As Deitz noted, last year about 10% of service firms anticipated layoffs, but very few actually occurred. “What firms are anticipating doing with respect to AI is dependent on economic conditions,” he said.

Title: Record profits, layoffs: Wall Street cheers as workers fear

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Layoffs are grabbing headlines this week. On Tuesday, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it will slash up to 25% of its workforce, or about 3,250 roles — a pattern now visible across many other oil and gas companies. Chevron has likewise announced up to 9,000 cuts likely this year. Too much oil in the market and too little confidence in future demand have squeezed margins across the industry, so companies like Conoco and Chevron are leaning on job cuts to preserve cash flow. It makes sense, even if it’s not a pretty trend. Layoffs at Big Tech companies also appear elevated, but the profit and growth story in that sector could hardly be more different. Even as companies post record second-quarter profits and boast of expanding margins and AI breakthroughs, players large and less-large are slashing headcount. On Wednesday, Salesforce posted a 10% revenue jump to $10.2 billion and an 11% rise in its favored demand metric. Profits surged, and buybacks ballooned by $20 billion. Yet the company also reportedly gutted 4,000 support jobs, with CEO Marc Benioff saying he “needs less heads” as AI agents now handle about a million customer conversations. Oracle is also enjoying its own banner year. Shares are up 33% year to date, hitting record highs this summer as AI cloud demand spiked. Its most recent results, released mid-summer, showed sales growing by 11% to nearly $16 billion. Behind the scenes, however, state filings and worker posts show thousands of jobs disappearing across Seattle, California, Texas, and Kansas — longtime employees included. Oracle's next earnings are due Sept. 9, with analysts predicting more positive financial news. Cisco is another example. The company recently said that hundreds of positions are set to be cut, many of them in software engineering. The announcement came even as the company reported an 8% rise in its recent quarter, with revenue rising to $14.7 billion. It also came on top of deep cuts in 2024, when Cisco eliminated some 5,000 jobs, or roughly 7% of its workforce, as part of a plan to redirect spending toward “high-growth areas.” Cisco stock has risen about 15% year to date, behind some tech competitors, but still well ahead of the overall S&P 500. Microsoft, in its most recent quarter, posted sales of nearly $80 billion, and net income of $27 billion, up 24%, with earnings per share rising in tandem at 24%, too. Shares have risen some 20% this year, and the company has cut its workforce deeply at the very same time — with 15,000 workers laid off so far in 2025. Amazon, which like Microsoft is spending tens of billions on various AI buildouts, has also cut jobs throughout 2025, while also posting rocketing sales and profits. In its most recent release, CEO Andy Jassy expressly tied the growth to AI, saying: “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out as we’ve expanded Alexa+ to millions of customers, continue to see our shopping agent used by many millions of customers, launched AI models like DeepFleet that optimize productivity paths for our 1M+ robots, made it much easier for software developers to write code with Kiro,” on top of similar AI developments. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” Jassy concluded. Bucking the overall tech-stock trend, Amazon shares have lagged the market so far this year. But taken together, the message appears clear. Efficiency is in, even if it comes at the expense of payrolls — or perhaps explicitly because it comes at the expense of payrolls. Wall Street keeps rewarding companies that adopt AI while trimming, automating, and streamlining. Meanwhile, for workers, the era of record profits feels more like an era of record precarity.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop is scrapping its budget line in the brand's latest shift

Things aren't so good for Good Clean Goop. Less than two years after it launched, Good Clean Goop — the accessible product line from Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand — is shutting down, a company spokesperson confirmed. The line's relationship with Target, its exclusive brick-and-mortar retailer, ended earlier this year. Both the retailer and Goop declined to provide further details about the line's performance. The line launched in 2023 at Target and on Amazon, and boasted about a dozen products, all under $40 — a far cry from the costly products, like a $150 peptide serum, that Goop had become known for. "I'm so excited for more people who are curious about clean beauty — or who simply appreciate a quality cream or a hardworking cleanser — to be able to try our new line of essentials," Paltrow said in a statement ahead of the line's launch. Some products remain available for purchase on Amazon, though more than half are discounted. "Good.clean.goop introduced many new customers to the goop brand," a Goop spokesperson said in a statement. They described it as "part of a broader strategic shift, focusing on its core business and upcoming initiatives where we're seeing significant momentum." There were signs that the line struggled to gain traction. Last year, Puck reported that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target, and two former Goop employees told Business Insider that they expected the partnership to end in early 2025. The brand's Instagram profile has not posted since October 2024. In June, Goop attempted another strategy to reach the masses: partnering with Ulta Beauty to sell its primary beauty line, Goop Beauty, both on Ulta.com and in 800 stores. Paltrow told WWD last month that beauty was the brand's primary revenue driver. Since its 2008 founding, Goop, which has raised about $140 million according to PitchBook, has made several pivots. Goop launched as a media company, though it has since made significant cuts to its editorial staff and folded its magazine. The brand tried its hand at developing books and TV shows, including a Netflix docuseries, but hasn't released any such projects since 2023. A push into the wellness space with a supplement regimen, which the company said generated $100,000 in sales in one day in 2017, did not last, and other initiatives, like the cruise Goop at Sea, have also shut down. In 2024, the company underwent two rounds of layoffs and remained unprofitable, as Business Insider previously reported. Last year, Goop said that it would focus on beauty, fashion, and food moving forward. Jump to

Season 2 premieres on December 11. Hayley Atwell (Mission: Impossible, Agent Carter) voices Lara Croft in the show, which also features Karen Fukuhara (The Boys) as the voice of Croft's friend, Sam. Like the game series, The Legend of Lara Croft follows Croft on a globe-trotting adventure where she seeks out mysteries relics. The Legend of Lara Croft is produced by Legendary TV and produced by Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson and Mike Goldberg, who are also behind the Sonic the Hedgehog film series. Noah Hughes from Crystal Dynamics is an executive producer on the show. This news comes just a day after Amazon MGM Studios announced that Sophie Turner will star in a Tomb Raider TV series from Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As for the game series, Crystal Dynamics is currently at work on the next Tomb Raider game--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com Use your keyboard!

Title: AST SpaceMobile Plans 40 Direct to Cellphone Satellites Early in 2026

Home » Space » AST SpaceMobile Plans 40 Direct to Cellphone Satellites Early in 2026 AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is developing a space-based cellular broadband network that provides direct-to-cellphone connectivity worldwide. This would eliminate deadzones without requiring special antennas like existing satellite phones and will work on standard smartphones. Their satellites, known as BlueBird, are designed to deliver 4G/5G service from low Earth orbit (LEO) by beaming signals directly to unmodified cell phones. The BlueBird 6 is the sixth BlueBird satellite shipped last month, August 2025. They are actively building components and phased arrays for the next 40 satellites to support expanded deployment by early 2026. This builds on their initial launch of the first five commercial BlueBird satellites (Block 1) on September 12, 2024, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The plan for 40 additional Block 2 BlueBird satellites is part of a broader initiative to deploy 45-60 satellites by the end of 2026, enabling continuous coverage in key markets. Each BlueBird satellite costs $19-23 million to manufacture and launch, with recent increases due to supply chain factors (up from $19-22 million previously). $1.3 billion is needed for the full deployment by 2026, including manufacturing, launches, and operations. They have nearly a $1 billion of cash on hand. AST Spacemobile satellites will be at 600-900 kilometers of altitude. AT&T, which along with Verizon has committed other spectrum access for AST SpaceMobile to reach mobile subscribers beyond the range of cell towers, previously announced plans to trial the service with select first responders in 2025. The long-term goal is a constellation of up to 168 satellites for global coverage. The full constellation of 168 satellites could take several more years, depending on funding and launch availability. The BlueBird satellites are large, unfoldable structures optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) cellular connectivity. Each satellite features a massive communications array measuring 693 square feet (about 64 square meters), which unfolds in orbit to create a phased-array antenna for beaming signals to cell phones. They are designed to support up to 40 MHz of bandwidth per beam, enabling peak data speeds of up to 120 Mbps. They are compatible with 3GPP-standard 4G/5G protocols, allowing seamless integration with existing cellular networks. On June 13, AST SpaceMobile announced a $550 million deal for long-term access to 45 MHz of premium lower mid-band spectrum in the United States and Canada for over 80 years. This deal with Ligado Networks, Viasat, and Inmarsat provides AST with 40 MHz of L-Band Mobile Satellite Service spectrum plus an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz band. AST SpaceMobile has secured agreements with over 45 mobile network operators (MNOs) worldwide, covering more than 2.8 billion subscribers.

04 September 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Khabarhub brings you a glimpse of major developments of the day in Nepal, including politics, business/economy, sports, entertainment, and more. Nepal directs ISPs to block 26 unregistered social media platforms The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has instructed the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) to direct Internet service providers (ISPs) to block 26 social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, including Facebook. NTA Executive Director Min Prasad Aryal confirmed that ISPs have already received instructions to implement the ban. The decision follows the government’s directive that all social media platforms must complete registration under the Social Media Use Directive, within the timeframe set by the cabinet. These are the apps govt is blocking for not registering The government is enforcing its decision to block all social media platforms that have not completed official registration, effective immediately. This move follows a Supreme Court order and a recent ministerial meeting led by Communications Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung. Currently, only five platforms have completed registration and are allowed to operate in Nepal. These include TikTok, Viber, Nimbuzz, WeTalk, and Opolive. Platforms still in the process of registration, such as Telegram and Global Link, are temporarily permitted to operate. Meta reaches out to government over listing; Hamro Patro submits application Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reached out to the government of Nepal regarding the mandatory listing of social media platforms. According to Information Ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur, Meta representatives contacted the ministry’s secretariat to inquire about the required procedures and documents for listing. Seven provisions behind Nepal’s social media ban The government has said it will start blocking social media platforms that have not completed official registration, citing seven specific provisions under the Social Media Use Directive. The move follows a Supreme Court order requiring platforms to register before operating in Nepal. The government had issued a seven-day deadline starting August 28 for platforms to complete registration, but foreign-based operators failed to comply. With the deadline expired, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, in consultation with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, initiated the ban. Leaders criticize government’s decision to block social media The government’s decision to block 26 social media platforms, including unregistered Facebook, has drawn sharp criticism from political leaders. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa called the move “a step in the wrong direction.” He said the Supreme Court had directed the government to make laws for regulation, not impose blanket bans. “The government has taken a reverse course. This must be reconsidered,” he said. Thapa added that social media is vital for freedom of expression, public debate, and government accountability. Maoist Centre to launch protests against government after Dashain-Tihar The main opposition, CPN (Maoist Centre), has decided to initiate protests against the government after the Dashain and Tihar festivals. Spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota said the office-bearers’ meeting held at the party headquarters in Parisdanda on Thursday concluded that corruption is on the rise and governance has weakened, prompting the need for protest. He added that the party would use street demonstrations to raise public awareness about democratic republican socialism and the socialist-oriented system envisioned in the constitution. PM Oli’s India visit uncertain, says Indian media Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is reportedly unlikely to visit India, according to an Indian news outlet. The Print Online cited sources suggesting that Oli’s planned visit on September 15 may not take place. The report comes shortly after a brief meeting between PM Modi and PM Oli on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, earlier this week. FNJ protests government decision to block social media The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has opposed the government’s decision to shut down unregistered social media platforms. In a statement issued on Thursday, FNJ General Secretary Ram Prasad Dahal said the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology’s decision to restrict unlisted platforms would curtail press freedom and freedom of expression. Ram Hari Khatiwada files candidacy for chair of Parliamentary Hearing Committee Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada has filed his candidacy for the post of chairperson of the Parliamentary Hearing Committee. He registered his nomination on Thursday following his party’s recommendation. Karn Thapa registers dissent ahead of UML’s statute convention CPN-UML Standing Committee member Karn Bahadur Thapa has officially registered his dissenting opinion at the party’s central office ahead of the second statute convention, set to begin on Friday. “I am at the party’s central office to formally register my dissent,” Thapa said on Thursday. “Once registered, I will make my dissent public. This is meant to contribute to internal party debate.” Parliamentary committee expresses dissatisfaction over new parliament building construction A parliamentary committee has expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of construction work on the new Parliament building, which is still under construction. On Thursday, the Committee on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Implementation of Directive Principles, Policies, and Responsibilities of the State, under the Federal Parliament, carried out a surprise inspection of the project. The committee remarked that the construction progress was far behind schedule. Embossed number plates essential for Digital Nepal: Transport Nepal Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal has emphasized that embossed number plates on vehicles are necessary to advance the government’s Digital Nepal initiative. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Minister Dahal explained that agreements for installing embossed plates had been signed three times in the past, and failing to implement them would require the government to pay Rs 3 billion to manufacturers without receiving any production. He clarified that the current government was merely implementing previous agreements. NEPSE dips by 6.55 points The Nepal stock market slipped by 6.55 points on Thursday, with the NEPSE index closing at 2,719.77. Before the weighted average calculation, the market was down by less than one point, but it fell by six points after the official tally. Trading volume increased compared to the previous day, reaching Rs 5.14 billion, up from Rs 4.72 billion. Among listed companies, 85 saw their share prices rise, 165 declined, and one remained unchanged. India enforces new India clarifies entry rules for Nepalis as new Immigration Act comes into effectimmigration rules The Government of India has introduced new immigration regulations under the Immigration and Foreigners Act 2025, effective from September 1, according to the Times of India. The Act grants expanded powers to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), with the aim of curbing fraud, assisting state authorities in deporting illegal immigrants, and establishing a centralized immigration database. Inactive social media platforms to be reactivated once registered: Communication Ministry The government has decided to deactivate social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on Thursday. The ministry stated that the move follows a Supreme Court order requiring both domestic and foreign online and social media platforms to undergo mandatory registration before operation in Nepal. Bhandari’s membership row is not an internal party dispute: Shankar Pokharel CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel has said that the issue of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s party membership should not be viewed as an internal dispute within UML but rather as a clash between her aspiration to reclaim membership and the party’s institutional decision. Speaking ahead of the second statute convention, which begins tomorrow in Godavari, Pokharel said the matter has been amplified outside the party even though it is essentially about setting a new precedent. Thapa cleared by EC to contest Rupandehi-3 by-election The candidacy of Dr. Lekh Jung Thapa, fielded by the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) for the upcoming Rupandehi-3 by-election, has sparked a wave of debate on social media. The discussion emerged after social media users cited a provision mentioned in a press release issued by Election Commission spokesperson and Joint Secretary Nita Pokharel Aryal on July 20. The provision states that individuals whose names remain on the closed list of proportional representation (PR) candidates from the 2022 federal and provincial elections cannot contest in upcoming polls. Nepali garment industries creating thousands of jobs: Minister Bhandari Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari has said that Nepal’s garment industries are creating employment opportunities for thousands of people while contributing significantly to the country’s economic development. Speaking at the inauguration of the 30th Annual General Assembly of the Nepal Garment Association on Wednesday, Minister Bhandari noted that the sector has played a vital role in generating jobs and earning foreign currency for the nation. RSP’s public affairs secretary Badan Bhandari attacked in Kathmandu Badan Bhandari, Secretary of the Public Affairs Department of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was attacked late last night in Pragati Chowk, Kapan, according to party officials. RSP Chair Rabi Lamichhane’s aide Pramod Nyaupane said three assailants on a motorcycle with its number plate concealed carried out the attack. Two of them struck Bhandari with iron rods, while the third was carrying a khukuri. Gold and silver prices unchanged The price of gold has remained unchanged on Thursday. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association, the price of gold is Rs 207,900 per tola. RPP demands PM Oli’s clarification on reported agreement with China’s GSI The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) has demanded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli clarify reports that Nepal has agreed to join China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). Speaking during the zero hour of the House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, RPP General Secretary Dr. Dhawal Shumsher Rana sought an explanation from the Prime Minister on behalf of his party.

Title: 20VC + SaaStr is Back With Canva Founder Cliff Obrecht: Anthropic’s $13B Round, OpenAI’s $1.1B Statsig Acquisition & Why Public SaaS Is Back From The Dead

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale We’re back on 20VC+SaaStr, and its a great one as Canva Co-Founder and COO Cliff Obrecht joins Harry, Rory and Jason for a deep dive into this week’s biggest venture deals, AI infrastructure spending, and the return of public SaaS valuations. And why Canva won’t direct list. Cliff Obrecht (Canva COO): “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate. We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” Jason Lemkin (SaaStr): “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025 — you kind of failed as a founder because you have no excuse. You had 18 months.” Rory O’Driscoll (Scale Venture Partners): “Even if Anthropic goes from $9B ARR to $30B (3x growth down from 10x), that’s 8x next year’s revenues. High absolute number? Absolutely. Does it make sense if the growth persists? It’s not crazy.” Harry Stebbings (20VC): “Most VCs should have had Anthropic’s trajectory in their model 47 days ago. These companies are out-accelerating plan, but you’re always valuing future growth.” Anthropic’s latest funding round grabbed headlines not just for its size — $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money valuation — but for what the math reveals about AI company valuations when you dig deeper. “I went into the analysis expecting to say ‘aren’t those guys so silly paying so much?'” admits Rory O’Driscoll. “But when you look at the numbers, maybe those guys are being quite smart.” The trajectory is staggering: from $100 million two years ago to a $1 billion run rate at the start of this year, now approaching $8-9 billion by year-end. If accurate, this represents roughly 9x revenue growth in a single year. O’Driscoll’s forward-looking analysis reveals why investors were fighting to get in: “Even if they decelerate from 10x to 3x growth next year — going from $9B to $30B ARR — the average revenue would be around $20B. That’s 8x next year’s revenues if the growth persists.” The round was massively oversubscribed, with demand reportedly 5-10x the amount raised. For growth-stage investors, sitting out seemed impossible. “If you’re a growth stage investor, it’s hard to imagine a world where you say ‘well, we’re growth stage investors but the two largest market cap companies in the last 3-5 years are the two LLM models and we don’t have a piece of that,'” notes O’Driscoll. On the same day, OpenAI announced its acquisition of Statsig for $1.1 billion in stock — exactly matching the company’s last funding round valuation from Iconic Ventures. With Statsig generating $75 million ARR, the deal represents roughly 15x revenue multiple. The acquisition makes strategic sense beyond the numbers. Statsig’s CEO now ranks as #3 at OpenAI, and with Figma’s CEO joining OpenAI’s leadership, the company is assembling serious product talent. “The fact that it was exactly the price of the last round shows this was something that everyone wanted to roll into,” observes O’Driscoll. For Iconic, which led Anthropic’s previous round and was blocked from OpenAI’s direct investment, this provided a backdoor into the OpenAI ecosystem. Public SaaS companies delivered a surprise comeback this quarter, with Snowflake leading the charge with a 45% stock jump after reporting 24% year-over-year growth — a significant reacceleration from previous quarters. “It’s the Mark Twain reports of my debt were greatly exaggerated,” quips Rory. “Well, it turns out reports of the death of SaaS and software were greatly exaggerated.” The winners weren’t universal — MongoDB, Box, Elastic, Okta, and Zoom all posted strong results, while others like Salesforce haven’t yet seen the AI benefit flow through to revenue. “Some folks, about half of the public B2B leaders, are finally getting an AI tailwind,” says Lemkin. “Box should be crushing it because every time I spin up a new AI app, I need like two or three databases.” The market reaction reveals how beaten down expectations had become. When companies like Snowflake delivered even modest beats against lowered expectations, investors responded dramatically. Jensen Huang’s prediction of $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next five years sparked intense debate about whether such capex levels can generate sufficient returns. “Look at $4 trillion — you want a 20% return on equity, you’ve got to be generating $800 billion of profit,” calculates O’Driscoll. “That’s a lot of profit when Facebook and Meta combined make a couple hundred billion a year. You’ve got to believe you’re going to create another four Microsofts, another four Facebooks to justify that kind of spend.” The discussion revealed how AI costs are already impacting SaaS margins. Notion famously went from 90% to 80% gross margins, effectively paying a 10% “GPU tax” on their revenue. Canva’s Obrecht confirmed similar impacts: “100% yes, it already is [10% of revenue]. If you look at Lovable, their pass-through to Anthropic or model providers will be way more than 10%.” However, Obrecht expects optimization over time: “We’re betting on distilling these models down, understanding user queries and where I need the frontier model versus where I can deploy the model that’s on-device or self-hosted. Companies will get better at picking the right model for the right job.” Obrecht provided rare insights into Canva’s current trajectory and IPO preparations. The company will close the year “very close if not at $4 billion” in revenue, growing at nearly 40% and reaccelerating. “We have a lot of long-term partners and you want to pay loyalty to people that have supported you along the way, but we’re also thinking through what an IPO looks like,” Obrecht explained about their current secondary round approach. With over a billion in cash and eight years of profitability, Canva doesn’t need primary capital. The challenge became managing a supply-demand imbalance when employees wanted to sell after seeing Figma’s public debut. On timing, Obrecht noted: “We’re gearing up to be an IPO ready company. When we actually go out is another question, but we want to be ready.” The company faces the classic late-stage private company dilemma. “What is the real difference?” asks Obrecht about staying private versus going public. “As a late stage private company with all the big institutions already invested and continuing to do so, our reporting obligations and expectations to beat and raise are pretty much the same.” Obrecht was candid about the limitations of private market liquidity solutions: “There’s availability to capital which we have access to. I think it’s probably liquidity and there are restrictions particularly around employee liquidity and what you can do in the US and whatnot around that piece.” The 13-year-old company recognizes the fairness issue: “We’re 13 years old as a company. Our employees should have liquidity. They’ve created all this value. How can we make it easy for them to access that wealth that’s built up?” But secondary markets aren’t a perfect substitute for public liquidity: “While secondaries, annual secondaries are a mechanism for that, it’s pretty janky and particularly in some jurisdictions, it’s downright impossible.” This creates the awkward dynamic where employees need permission from their employer to access liquidity they’ve earned through years of value creation. “Having to get permission from your employer to get liquidity as a secondary after 13 years — it’s better than no liquidity but it’s a little bit serf-like,” notes one participant. “When you’re public you can make your own choices.” Canva’s AI integration offers a window into how established SaaS companies are navigating the transition. “AI is just accelerating [our mission] massively, making it quicker, faster, and better for customers to achieve their goals,” says Obrecht. The company is moving to a unified credit model for AI features, with free users getting limited credits, premium subscribers getting more, and heavy users paying usage-based pricing beyond certain thresholds. “We’ve got 240 million users. We’re about to launch in October a whole slew of new AI products deeply integrating it into every part of the workflow. We need to seriously run the math on if 20%, 50%, 80% of our users use this 10 times a month — the costs can look pretty big and eat into margins very significantly.” The conversation revealed fascinating insights about venture capital psychology around “the ones that got away.” Multiple participants shared examples of passing on companies early, then struggling to invest at higher valuations later. “Many of my most successful deals I’ve passed on prior,” admits O’Driscoll. “When you see the company say they’ll do A, B, and C, you pass because you don’t believe they’ll do A, B, and C, and then they do A, B, and even C prime — you have what you need to know.” The key insight: “The difference in information content between two data points over time, both of which are positive, and one data point where you have no calibration is almost infinite.” Obrecht observed this pattern with Canva investors: “The best investors that have done best out of Canva were early stage funds, but they realized ‘Holy shit, we’re onto something here.’ So they raised SPVs or additional vehicles to move further up the value chain, going later and later stage and compounded their position.” 1. AI Valuations Aren’t As Crazy As They Look Forward revenue multiples for companies like Anthropic become reasonable when you factor in sustained hypergrowth trajectories. 2. Public SaaS Is Back, But Selectively. Companies with distribution advantages and AI integration are seeing real reacceleration (Snowflake, Datadog, Box, Okta, GitLab even Zoom), while others remain stuck. 3. The 10% GPU Tax Is Real SaaS companies are already spending 10%+ of revenue on AI inference, but optimization will bring costs down over time. 4. Private-to-Public Arbitrage Exists Again Public markets are now valuing companies higher than late-stage private markets in many cases. 5. Don’t Let Pride Stop Follow-On Investments The biggest VC returns often come from doubling down on companies you initially passed on after seeing execution. “If Zuck’s not feeling great about his AI strategy, he can cry into his $200 billion and get over it on his own, right? Take it up with a therapist.” — Rory O’Driscoll on Zuck’s Meta challenges “We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” — Cliff Obrecht on Canva’s financial position “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate.” — Cliff Obrecht on market volatility vs execution “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025.” — Jason Lemkin on AI tailwinds for established SaaS companies “It’s a bit embarrassing as an early stage investor to buy Revolut off Goldman Sachs. That’s when you really fuck up as an early stage investor.” — Harry Stebbings on VC regret psychology Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Broadcom Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Broadcom Inc. AVGO will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 4. Analysts expect the tech company to report quarterly earnings at $1.65 per share, up from $1.24 per share in the year-ago period. Broadcom projects to report quarterly revenue at $15.83 billion, compared to $13.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in eight of the last 10 quarters overall. Some investors are eyeing potential gains from Broadcom's annual dividend yield of 0.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 59 cents per share ($2.36 a year). To earn $500 monthly from Broadcom, start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Broadcom's $2.36 dividend: $6,000 / $2.36 = 2,542 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $768,675 worth of Broadcom, or 2,542 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.36 = 508 shares, or $153,614 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis; the dividend payment and the stock price fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. AVGO Price Action: Shares of Broadcom rose by 1.4% to close at $302.39 on Wednesday.

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest September 25, 2025 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review September 25, 2025 issue Illustration by George Wylesol Illustration by George Wylesol Submit a letter: Email us letters@nybooks.com Reviewed: The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the Future of the West Last year, according to a recent report in The New York Times, Alexander Karp received a total of $6.8 billion for his services as CEO of the data analytics software company Palantir Technologies. This “compensation actually paid”—a metric that takes into account not just salary but also the amount by which stock holdings increase—made Karp, by a large margin, the highest-paid CEO in the United States. For anyone paying attention to Palantir’s recent fortunes, this was no great surprise. The stock value of the company—whose revenue comes largely from government contracts for data surveillance and the military application of artificial intelligence—is, one might say, negatively indexed to the peace and freedom of humanity. Over the past year the company’s stock has increased in value by a factor of almost six. At the time of writing Palantir was worth $375 billion, making it the twenty-second most valuable company in the S&P 500—just ahead of Coca-Cola and behind Bank of America. “Bad times,” as Karp put it in a recent CNBC appearance, “are incredibly good for Palantir.” And the times, of course, have been incredibly bad. Russia’s long and brutal war of imperial aggression in Ukraine. Israel’s campaign of mass slaughter and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The outbreak of a larger war in the Middle East (now in a fragile détente) amid expressions of enthusiasm for a violent overthrow of the Iranian leadership. In the US an unprecedented campaign of deportations, leading to civil unrest in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And in all of these situations, there is a great deal of money to be made by a company providing data surveillance and AI systems for military use. The most vivid illustration of this dynamic I have seen is a meme posted to r/PLTR, Reddit’s “unofficial, independent community for retail investors of PLTR to chat about the company, its mission, Alex Karp, and all things pertaining to the stock.” In the background of a photograph taken in a deli or fast-food restaurant, we see a cluster of men involved in a chaotic physical altercation, while in the foreground a middle-aged man sits at a table, entirely unbothered, absorbed in his smartphone. The fighting men are labeled “EUROPE,” “USA,” “ISRAEL,” and “IRAN,” while over the man in the foreground are the words “ME CHECKING THE PRICE OF PALANTIR.” Cofounded in 2003 by Karp and his Stanford friend Peter Thiel, who had recently made serious money from the sale of PayPal to eBay, Palantir Technologies was conceived, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as a provider of machine learning and data analytics for the purposes of national security and surveillance. The reasoning went like this: if the US government had been able, in September 2001, to collate and analyze disparate data points—flight school enrollments, anomalies in travel patterns, suspicious associations—the Twin Towers might still be standing, and the people who died that day might still be alive. Palantir’s software facilitates the finding of patterns in large datasets, and presents such information in easily searchable and navigable form. In a recent conversation with Maureen Dowd for The New York Times, which introduced Karp to the paper’s readers as a “billionaire man of mystery,” he described the work his company does as “the finding of hidden things.” (Karp has been a beneficiary of a near uniformly credulous media, and not just in his native country: in 2016 the German daily Die Welt ran a story about him whose headline translates as “This Genius Is Building the Most Important Company in the World.” Karp, it’s worth pointing out, formerly served on the board of directors of the Axel Springer publishing group, Die Welt’s parent company.) Thiel, a Tolkien obsessive of long standing, named the company after the palantíri in The Lord of the Rings—the “far-seeing stones,” one of which was used by the dark lord Sauron to surveil, from his seat of power in Mordor, the inhabitants of Middle Earth. Palantir’s critics, though, are less inclined to invoke Tolkien than they are Philip K. Dick, whose short story “The Minority Report” concerns an authoritarian future society in which “precrime” detectives arrest people for crimes they have not yet carried out but merely formed the intention of committing. Here’s how Karp put it in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2009: “What we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate-based search. So we would look at you, and then we would go out and say, oh, there’s lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone involved in bad behavior.” Along with Thiel’s initial investment of $30 million, the company received an early cash injection of $2 million from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Although Palantir also works with corporate clients like Walmart and Wendy’s—which uses Palantir’s AI to manage its inventories of burgers and fries—its earliest and most enduringly important clients were state agencies like the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, for whom it acts as an outsourced provider of intelligence gathering and analytics. During the first Trump term, Palantir became strongly associated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), providing it with surveillance and deportation logistics. Palantir’s FALCON software helped ICE collate and analyze vast amounts of data to map family connections and plan future raids. In 2018 ICE used FALCON to prepare for raids on around a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the US. Advertisement In October 2023, in the days after the attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory, Palantir took out a full-page ad in The New York Times that read, “Palantir stands with Israel.” The following January, by which time the Israeli government’s genocidal response to those attacks had been underway for three months, the company’s board of directors gathered in Tel Aviv. While there, Karp and Thiel met with Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, and subsequently signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with AI for advanced targeting capabilities. (In discussing this technology, Karp has used the phrase kill chain, a military term of art that refers to the structure of an attack—the identification of a target, the dispatching of military force to its location, and the assault on and destruction of that target.) The company’s share price began to rise vertiginously. “Hamas really took us to the moon,” as one characteristically elated r/PLTR poster put it. Karp’s personal wealth and his public ebullience rose with it. In February of this year, by which time Palantir’s market value had surpassed that of the Walt Disney Company, Karp appeared in an online video call with retail investors. Dressed in a white T-shirt, Karp delivered an apparently ad hoc speech, his arms spread wide in a show of triumphal grandeur and his graying curls bouncing jauntily. “We’re doing it!” he said. We’re doing it! And I’m sure you’re enjoying this as much as I am…. We are crushing it…. We have dedicated our company to the service of the West, and to the United States of America…. Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. If Hamas took Palantir shareholders to the moon, the return of Donald Trump to the White House, and the subsequent brief and disastrous reign of Elon Musk, took them to Mars. This April it emerged that ICE was paying the company $30 million to develop a software system, known as ImmigrationOS, to track immigrants using biometric and geolocation data. The second Trump administration has deepened Palantir’s already substantial relationship with the federal government, extending its reach across multiple departments. In March Trump signed an executive order directing the government to share data across agencies, raising concerns, as The New York Times put it, that the president “might compile a master list of personal information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power,” and that he might use personal information “to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics.” Palantir’s selection as the main partner for this data-sharing project, the Times reported, was driven by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at least three members of which were known to have formerly worked at Palantir. While all this was going on—while he was becoming America’s highest-paid CEO and facilitating a growing police state at home and a genocidal campaign in Gaza—Karp somehow managed to squeeze in writing a book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he managed to dictate one: The Technological Republic, which was published earlier this year, is credited to both Karp and one Nicholas W. Zamiska, Palantir’s head of corporate affairs and legal counsel to the office of the CEO. Speaking with Bari Weiss on her podcast, Karp put it as follows: “I would say, in complete candor, 95 percent plus of the ideas are mine, 90 percent of the writing is his. And the writing is phenomenal.” The writing, I’m sorry to say, is not at all phenomenal; it is uniformly adequate. The division of literary labor, in any case, seems to be such that Karp deployed his own legal counsel in much the same manner as an ordinary person who didn’t want to put in the work might use a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT, throwing out a mess of half-formed ideas to be put into serviceable prose. Advertisement I don’t wish to unduly diminish the contribution of Zamiska, who for all I know may believe that coauthorship of The Technological Republic redounds to his credit, but it’s bad enough having to read and write about this book without also having to mention both these guys every time I refer to it, so I’m going to take Karp’s lead here and proceed on the understanding that the book is essentially his work. And as I made my way sluggishly through its pages—through its business-casual banalities, its pallid apologias for Western civilization and imperial violence—I found myself increasingly preoccupied by a single question: Why did Alexander Karp want to write this thing in the first place? I suspect that his reasons are at least partly related to the Silicon Valley cult of the tech-founder-as-philosopher-king, and have to do with Karp’s desire to be viewed as not just a businessman but also a public intellectual. This book exists, in other words, in order for Karp to have written a book. Much has been made of his academic and intellectual credentials. He has a doctorate in social theory from Frankfurt’s Goethe Universität. (It has often been noted that while he was there he “studied under” Jürgen Habermas, but that appears to be a stretch; according to Die Welt, he wrote to Habermas asking him to supervise his Ph.D., and Habermas passed him along to a colleague.) He quotes Adorno in his shareholder letters. He plays fast and loose with words like hermeneutics and ontology. On the evidence of The Technological Republic, Habermas, whatever his reasons, made the right call. Its thesis can be outlined briefly enough: Silicon Valley, whose foundational companies were built on defense contracts, has strayed too far, for too long, from its original mission. Its prevailing culture, influenced by the “woke” ideas trickling downward from elite institutions of higher education, is such that building technologies to serve the “national interest” has become almost unthinkable for a generation of talented but misguided engineers. These brilliant minds, argues Karp, are being wasted on lucrative but frivolous projects—on-demand laundry services, apps that can bring you a burrito in a taxi, and so on. “The software industry,” he writes, should rebuild its relationship with government and redirect its effort and attention to constructing the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively face. The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defense of the nation and the articulation of a national project—what is this country, what are our values, and for what do we stand. Karp’s friendship with Thiel is often said to be structured around their ideological differences. Thiel, who supported Trump before it was profitable or popular to do so, is widely viewed as a libertarian. Karp has in the past publicly identified as a progressive and has even occasionally, and absurdly, referred to himself as a “socialist.” But in reality Karp is no more a progressive than Thiel—whose fortune is likewise derived largely from government contracts—is a libertarian. Much of The Technological Republic is given over to the kind of broad-strokes antiwokeism that can be found in dispiriting abundance in the nonfiction section of any airport bookstore. One of the book’s four sections is entitled “The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”—a typically overripe allusion to Allan Bloom’s classic conservative critique of cultural relativism in American higher education, The Closing of the American Mind. Through this long central section, Karp doesn’t elaborate so much as endlessly restate the argument about Silicon Valley having lost the courage of its foundational convictions. (It is often said that many nonfiction books should really have been magazine articles; this one feels like a LinkedIn post mercilessly stretched to nearly three hundred pages.) The book addresses a 2018 controversy around Project Maven, an AI warfare program for which Google was subcontracted by the Pentagon to provide machine learning and data management software. When the staff circulated a petition protesting the company’s involvement in technologies of war, Google discontinued its work on the project. Karp diagnoses a complacency about national security among younger “elites” who did not live through the geopolitical threats of the twentieth century. “The most capable generation of coders,” he writes, “has never experienced a war or genuine social upheaval. Why court controversy with your friends or risk their disapproval by working for the US military when you can retreat into the perceived safety of building another app?” Palantir stepped in to fill the defense-tech gap left by Google’s cowardly decision, a move that Karp implies should be a template for Silicon Valley’s future. He repeatedly claims that coders who want nothing to do with military technology are suffering from moral atrophy. Though they might seem, to you or me, to be acting on principle—because they oppose war in general or have a specific aversion to serving the interests of empire—they are motivated, he insists, not by a higher cause but by the desire to avoid the opprobrium of their peers. Such people, for Karp, are unwitting victims of self-censorship, who won’t even permit themselves to think about offending the prevailing morals: The dystopian future that Orwell and others have imagined may be near, but not because of the surveillance state or contraptions built by Silicon Valley giants that rob us of our privacy or most intimate moments alone. It is we, not our technical creations, who are to blame for failing to encourage and enable the radical act of belief in something above and beyond, and external to, the self. The speed and enthusiasm with which the culture skewers anyone for their perceived transgressions and errors—with which we descend on one another for deviations from the norm—only further diminishes our capacity to move toward truth. The book is filled with this sort of sanctimonious guff. If it were just another denunciation of cancel culture, it would be merely boring and belated. But coming from Alexander Karp, the CEO and cofounder of Palantir Technologies, this concern-trolling about a growing censoriousness in “the culture” feels almost intentional in its absurdity. At times I approached the book, perhaps to preserve my own psychic integrity, as an avant-garde exercise in narrative unreliability, an experiment in the dizzying extremes of dramatic irony that I associate most with Charles Kinbote, the comically oblivious narrator of Nabokov’s Pale Fire. Again and again I found myself responding to some sententious lament about Silicon Valley’s lack of moral values by scrawling “You run Palantir!” in the margin. Taken in isolation, Karp’s critique of Silicon Valley—that its most talented engineers and entrepreneurs have no sense of the larger public good—is merely banal, rather than wrong. What makes it deeply strange, and genuinely unsettling, is that what he positions as a moral project worthy of these great talents is essentially an algorithmic arms race with America’s geopolitical rivals. This project is, of course, one that Karp views as a defense of the West and its values. But he has almost nothing to say about these values, which he seems uninterested in even defining, let alone analyzing. One of the more aggravating aspects of the book is Karp’s perpetual gesturing in the general direction of philosophy—of serious subjects and serious engagements with them—without ever actually attempting such a thing. On many occasions, for instance, he invokes the philosophical notion of “the good life,” by way of a claim that the talented tech workers of Silicon Valley, and the culture of which they are a part, have entirely abandoned the question of what might constitute it. “The antiseptic nature of modern discourse,” he writes, dominated by an unwavering commitment to justice but deeply wary when it comes to substantive positions on the good life, is a product of our own reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate, and to risk the disapproval of the crowd. Silicon Valley, he writes elsewhere, is the product of “a cultural and moral agnosticism if not relativism that assiduously avoided anything approaching substantive views about the good life.” If Karp has any ideas about what “the good life” might actually be, though, he has been extraordinarily successful at keeping them secret. A cynical reader might conclude, in the absence of any other guidance, that perhaps the good life involves becoming a billionaire by selling AI weapons guidance systems and helping governments carry out mass surveillance on their citizens. A more generous reader might conclude that Karp is simply a busy man and doesn’t have the time to think this stuff through. Similarly, the book never delivers on its grandly Platonic title. Not only does Karp fail to describe the “Technological Republic” he invokes; he seems unaware that such a thing might even be expected of him. In this sense, among others, the book reads as the work of someone who wishes to be thought of as a public intellectual but isn’t willing to put in the effort to become one. In the brief passages in which Karp discusses his own leadership of Palantir and his ideas about what constitutes an effective organization, his primary goal is apparently to present himself as an unconventional thinker, by means of strenuously eclectic references—what businesses can learn from the social organization of honeybee swarms, what start-up founders can learn from experimental theater, what Stanley Milgram’s psychological experiments can teach us about creating something new in business, and so on. Such attempts at intellectual grooviness would be risible enough in themselves, were it not for the fact that all this disruptive innovation and free thinking is ultimately in service of a consolidation of state power and business interests—what is normally referred to as the military-industrial complex, which since the end of World War II has been at the root of many long and brutal foreign conflicts, as well as the fortunes of many ruthless and clever opportunists. Another reason The Technological Republic feels strangely untethered is that it seems to have been written toward the prospect of either a second Biden term or a Harris presidency. By the time it was published, in mid-February—when the princelings of Palo Alto were pledging mass fealty at the court of Mar-a-Lago, and Musk’s DOGE was setting about dismantling the federal government—a book-length argument for a closer relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, and for a tech industry aligned with the broader project of American power, had missed its moment. By that point Mark Zuckerberg had shed his liberal skin and undergone a transfiguration into a kind of uncanny-valley MAGA-bro. In late May he announced that Meta would be partnering with the defense-tech company Anduril to “design, build, and field a range of integrated XR [Extended Reality] products that provide warfighters with enhanced perception and enable intuitive control of autonomous platforms on the battlefield.” The partnership between Meta and Anduril is itself evidence of a major cultural shift. The founder of Anduril (also a Tolkien reference, to a sword in The Lord of the Rings) is Palmer Luckey, best known as the inventor of the Oculus Rift VR headset. After Facebook bought Oculus, Luckey was an employee for a time; in 2017 the company fired him after he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump group that paid for a billboard campaign deriding Hillary Clinton as “Too Big to Jail.” (Zuckerberg has recently expressed regret about the firing.) Announcing his company’s partnership with Meta, Luckey said, “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” One gadget Anduril is developing is called Eagle Eyes—a headset that provides “warfighters” with “360° threat awareness.” Luckey has invoked the video games Call of Duty and Halo. “The idea,” he said, “is to give warfighters superhuman vision, superhuman perception, superhuman hearing, and allow them to communicate with each other and large teams of autonomous systems.” Anduril is precisely the kind of project to which Karp, in The Technological Republic, argues engineers should be devoting their talents. “All these people who used to be tech bros are now defense tech bros,” as Noam Perski, Palantir’s international government lead, put it in a speech last December at a defense tech summit in Tel Aviv. Recently a venture capitalist friend told me that he knew several people in Silicon Valley who, just a few years ago, would have walked briskly in the opposite direction of anything remotely military-related, and who were now working on defense tech. When I agreed that there did seem to be something of a change in the ideological microclimates of the Bay Area, he said that there was no something of about it; it was a hard pivot, and an exceptionally fertile one for investors. See, for instance, Daniel Ek, the cofounder and CEO of Spotify, who led a recent €600 million investment into the German start-up Helsing. The company, cofounded by a video game developer and a former employee of Germany’s defense ministry, makes military drones and AI software for weapons systems and to improve battlefield decision-making. (Spotify subscribers may be interested to know that simply by streaming, say, Bob Dylan’s “Masters of War” or Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs,” they can now help to fund the international arms trade.) In June the US Army launched something called Executive Innovation Corps, which it described in a press release as “a new initiative designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation.” Under the program, four high-level tech executives were commissioned into the army reserve as lieutenant colonels. The four new officers were Palantir’s CTO, Shyam Sankar; Meta’s CTO, Andrew Bosworth; OpenAI’s chief product officer, Kevin Weil; and Bob McGrew, an adviser at Thinking Machines Lab who was formerly OpenAI’s chief research officer. The tech execs were sworn in on Friday, June 13. On Monday, the next day of trading, Palantir shares closed at an all-time high. If you want to know what a technological republic might look like, forget Alexander Karp’s insipid book; consider what is being constructed around you, and how little it resembles any kind of republic at all. Consider the bad times, and who they are good for.

US stock market futures traded mixed this morning, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq inching higher while the Dow slipped as investors turned cautious ahead of Thursday’s key jobs data. A stronger showing from tech giants like Apple and Alphabet kept momentum alive, but weak guidance from Salesforce and jitters in global markets signaled that traders are balancing optimism with caution.

Title: More Upside For Uber Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/04/more-upside-for-uber-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-04T10:00:10Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is no longer seen as the underdog. After years of doubt regarding its ability to generate profit, the company has successfully silenced detractors and generously rewarded its shareholders. The stock has risen approximately 30% over the past year and an impressive 50% year-to-date—compared to the S&P500 index, which has increased by 17% over the last year and 10% year-to-date. The pressing question is: with Uber finally prevailing on Wall Street, is there still potential for growth? Uber’s most recent quarter revealed $12.65 billion in revenue, marking an 18% increase year-over-year, while Gross Bookings grew 17% to reach $46.8 billion. Trips surged 18% to 3.3 billion, and net income amounted to $1.35 billion. However, the notable story is centered on cash flow. Uber generated $2.48 billion in free cash flow in Q2 alone, lifting the total for the trailing 12 months to over $8.5 billion. This financial strength enabled management to confidently announce a $20 billion share buyback, nearly 10% of the company’s market cap—a significant turnaround from the era when Uber was known for its cash burn. For those seeking growth with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and recorded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Alcoa Stock To Less Than $16? At current prices, Uber is trading at approximately 30x forward earnings and about 4x sales. This represents a premium over traditional transportation and logistics companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) at 13x or United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 16x, but is more reasonable than DoorDash stock (NASDAQ: DASH), which remains unprofitable and valued at 5.5x sales. Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), which is Uber’s closest competitor in the U.S., is priced lower at about 18x forward earnings but has not demonstrated the same scale or profitability. In essence, Uber is valued like a company that operates in two realms: more stable than a pure-play transport stock, yet not as richly valued as a high-growth tech platform. Investors are essentially wagering that Uber’s market position and cash flow can justify this mid-ground valuation. Despite its strong performance, Uber continues to face numerous challenges. Lyft remains a considerable competitor in ride-hailing, and DoorDash is competing aggressively in delivery. Logistics giants FedEx and UPS pose significant challenges in e-commerce. Moreover, Uber is making bold investments in its vision for the future: autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI-driven logistics. The company has invested substantially in partnerships with Waymo, Baidu, and others, and has even acquired a $300 million stake in Lucid to support its AV ambitions. In the long run, this could enhance profit margins by reducing the reliance on drivers. However, in the short term, investors are wary—autonomous technology is costly and its timelines are unpredictable. Uber’s stock has exhibited volatility during previous market downturns, at times performing worse than the S&P 500 index. Inflation Shock (2022) COVID-19 Pandemic (2020) The significant drawdown of 67% in 2022 indicates that a considerable decline from present levels is not extraordinary. This history of volatility, combined with a high stock price, leads to investor caution. See – Buy or Sell UBER Stock – for further details. With the stock up nearly 50% this year, Uber no longer appears as a deep value turnaround—it is now priced for performance. Analysts anticipate that bookings will approach $49 billion next quarter, with EBITDA guidance exceeding $2.2 billion. If Uber continues to deliver growth at this scale while repurchasing shares, the rally could gain momentum. The risk? At 30x forward earnings, Uber has less room for error. Any slowdown in global demand, stricter labor regulations, or setbacks in its autonomous strategies could lead to declines. However, Uber has decisively shed its former reputation and presents itself as a cash-rich, scalable platform. Investors are no longer just along for the ride with Uber—they are actively steering the gains. The substantial valuation of UBER stock might curtail its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As a different option, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), providing strong returns for investors. The reasoning? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, further explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: I'm a Gen Xer who's been looking for full-time work for 18 months. After more than 1,000 apps, I'm trying to reinvent myself.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-x-unemployed-job-market-reinvention-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-04T09:20:02Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Robert Poe, a 56-year-old former e-commerce director. His identity and former employment have been verified. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I started my career at IBM in digital marketing. My brother used to say to me, "You're always going to have a job." I've been through layoffs and worked at companies that shut down, but I never really had to look for a job in my role. My last position was as director of e-commerce at Badcock Home Furniture. I made $120,000 as my base salary. The company was eventually bought by a company that filed for bankruptcy. I lasted about six months in a new role that I landed. I wasn't worried about finding another job. But that was a year and a half ago. Since then, I've sent out over 1,000 résumés. The experience has been a shock. My wife and I sold our house and moved into an apartment. We've had to claim bankruptcy. I sold my car. We're partially living off of our sons' Social Security and my wife's job. Our daughter, who lives with us, helps pay rent. I pretty much have given up on finding e-commerce director roles. I guess I'm too old. I hear a lot of people saying, "Go start your own business," and "This is the time to reinvent yourself." So at 56, that's what I'm trying to do. I got my real estate license and tried that for a little. I was commuting about an hour each way to sit in an office with a bunch of 20-year-olds, doing exactly what I could have done at home. At some point, I realized that it's not realistic to work off strict commissions and commute to an office when nothing is coming in. So I tried out being an Amazon delivery worker for five months. I'm in shape and I work out. But at the end of the night, I couldn't walk up the stairs. It's a different world, especially when you're not used to being spoken to that way. It's a great side gig if you want some extra money, but it's not enough to live on. In addition to the gig work stuff, I've tried to be entrepreneurial. I launched a digital marketing startup called JBP Media Group with a partner who used to work with me. It will be another six months before any income comes in and I've had money come out of my pocket just to get it going. We've gotten a handful of clients, which is wonderful, and we have some employees offshore to help with some of the work. But when clients pay you $200 a month, you need a lot of those small clients. I've also published a book. I have two 20-year-old twin sons with special needs, and the book is about the expenses that hit special needs families. There are probably around $60,000 a year in expenses per kid, including transportation and insurance. Publishing the book has been a bucket list type of thing, and it's one that keeps your mind going. Starting a company has also kept me busy. Even if I'm working technically for free, it keeps my skills sharp. I keep trying everything on top of interviewing, thinking that something will hit. In the meantime, I have to keep going. I have been putting out about two to five résumés a day. I've met with tons of recruiters and have relationships with some of them. But a recruiter will ask to schedule a call and then never get back to me. I'm hearing more and more of that happening, where you get through an interview round and they put the job on hold or find someone internally. It's depressing. Everybody's saying, "LinkedIn's not the place to be anymore" or "You have to make your résumé different." It's incredibly confusing. It's like they flipped a switch overnight. The system's broken. For Gen X folks, it feels like if you're out of a job, then it's just too bad. Right now, I feel like a failure. But my message to other people is that something will work out, even if you have to go from a six-figure job to making $50,000 a year. For me now, I want to work for the Special Olympics, where I volunteer and coach paddleboarding. Even if it's a pay cut, I can start over, and we'll figure it out. Have you struggled to find a job? We want to hear from you. Reach out to the reporter via email at aaltchek@insider.com or through the secure messaging app Signal at aalt.19. Jump to

Title: ITS launches Single Stock ETF on shares of seven leading U.S. companies

September 04, 2025 02:05 ET | Source: ITS ITS ASTANA, Kazakhstan, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The international trading platform ITS on September 3 launched trading in Kazakhstan’s first Single Stock ETFs, based on shares of seven leading U.S. companies. The introduction of this new instrument expands opportunities for portfolio diversification and investment in high-value assets. Single Stock ETFs allow investors to acquire fractional parts of highly liquid shares, making securities with high prices accessible to a broad range of participants. In practice, this means purchasing individual shares through a fund at one hundredth or one thousandth of the full share price. At the first stage, ITS offers Single Stock ETFs on shares of seven companies: Amazon (AMZN/100), a leader in e-commerce and cloud technologies; Tesla (TSLA/100), a manufacturer of electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions; Netflix (NFLX/100), the largest streaming service; AMD (AMD/100), a developer of processors and graphics cards; MicroStrategy (MSTR/100), a provider of business analytics and institutional investor in Bitcoin; Coinbase (COIN/100), a leading U.S. crypto exchange; and Freedom Holding (FRHC/10000), an international investment company originating from the CIS. Each Single Stock ETF mirrors the price of one share and enables investors to start investing in equities with just a few cents or dollars. For example, an investor can buy one hundredth of a Tesla share for $3.29, with the full share closing at $329.36 on September 2, or one ten-thousandth of a Freedom Holding share for $0.015, with the share closing at $174.27. “We are offering one of the most advanced products on the market. This not only expands opportunities for investors but also makes our platform more attractive to new participants. We will continue to broaden our range of exchange-traded instruments to provide investors in Kazakhstan with the widest possible opportunities for investment,” said Chingiz Kanapyanov, CEO of ITS. Internationally, single-stock instruments are particularly popular among short-term traders who profit from volatility and among those seeking targeted diversification without purchasing full shares. On ITS, investments in single-stock ETFs provide a simple and transparent way to start investing. Trading is conducted in U.S. dollars, with income from these operations exempt from income tax in Kazakhstan. There are no management fees, as the fund is registered under the jurisdiction of the Astana International Financial Centre and listed on AIX. Investors are reminded that ETFs on individual shares carry market risks. Their value may rise or fall depending on the performance of the underlying share. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investors are advised to review the fund documents and carefully assess potential risks before investing. About ITSITS is an international liquidity hub. Central to ITS's business model are the principles of best execution and smart order routing technology. These principles enable investors to execute securities transactions at the best prices available on the global financial market, regardless of the transaction volume. This technology ensures that the liquidity for foreign securities on ITS matches that of leading international platforms where these securities are traded. ITS Central Securities Depository Limited, the central depository for ITS, offers depository services for the storage and settlement of securities. The depository has received Qualified Intermediary with primary withholding responsibility (WQI) status from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Operating a clearing house that acts as a Central Counterparty, ITS assumes the counterparty role for all obligations of clearing participants and manages the clearing process for transactions on the ITS trading platform. ITS also calculates its own indexes: the ITS World index (ITSW) and the ITS Shariah index (ITSS). Trading of the first ETF in Central Asia and Caucasus, pegged to the performance of ITS’s own index – ITS World (ticker: ITSW), began on ITS in November 2024, providing a wide range of investors with a convenient and balanced instrument for investing and trading with a low entry threshold. In January 2025, the ETF lineup expanded with the introduction of a fund based on the ITS Shariah Index. ITS's direct clients include professional securities market participants from Kazakhstan and other countries, such as financial intermediaries who are accredited and directly registered at the AIFC. Investors, both private individuals and legal entities, access trading through these financial intermediaries, such as brokers and banks.

Title: ROSEN, HIGHLY RANKED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 03, 2025 20:09 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
