The World Health Organization (WHO) has been sounding the alarm on a bird flu pandemic in 2025, and the plandemic — for that is what it is — is well upon us. Caused by the H5N1 virus, bird flu has been transmitted to humans, killing more than half of those infected — 460 out of 950 cases — in the past 22 years. Transmission between humans hasn’t occurred so far, but the prospects are alarming. While mutations or interaction with other viruses could certainly wreak havoc, the fear could be used — as in the 2020–21 Covid pandemic — to force people to isolate, get vaccinated, and remain under surveillance. And that is exactly what some experts fear is happening — a Covid redux, with the same playbook in operation. Only, this time, a slightly different approach is being taken. Instead of directly targeting humans, our food is the focus for the creation and mandating of ineffective vaccines. It’s a plausible scenario, considering how the authorities and the WHO have been ratcheting up the fear. In 2024, there were 81 cases of bird flu in humans, with 66 of those cases in the U.S. In 2025, so far there are three cases in the U.S., and one fatality (from Louisiana). Egg prices are skyrocketing — over $8 a dozen in some parts of the country — and more than 166 million wild and domestic fowl have died of the flu or been culled since 2022. During the last quarter alone 20 million chickens have died or been culled. Last week, Harvard Medical School put out a warning quoting Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases expert at Massachusetts General Hospital, as saying, “I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not. But we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.” But Dr. Clayton J. Baker of the Brownstone Institute, an internist and former professor of medical humanities and bioethics at the University of Rochester, believes the crisis is artificial. He says it has been created by so-called pandemic experts who are “actively seeking to perpetuate it.” Baker goes so far as to say that the bird flu virus was bioengineered for transmission across animal species and made potent to be able to infect humans. Meanwhile, technologies were developed and patented for making vaccines against this bioweapon. Baker alleges that one of the labs where reckless gain-of-function has been conducted for decades, with multiple lab leaks, is the Kawaoka bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin. According to him, in 2022, a strategic leak of the virus was arranged — from USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, and other laboratories in the U.S. and abroad. As PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing for bird flu turns up many false positives, causing alarm, the media dials it up further, allowing globalist agents in the government to use the fear factor to force the use of vaccines in the food supply chain. “This is not conspiracy theory,” Baker writes. “This is basic pattern recognition.” He calls for shutting down and investigating the Southeast Poultry Research and Kawaoka labs. The best course for preventing a real outbreak — as opposed to an engineered one — is to stop culling the flocks and allow them to develop immunity. Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist who championed alternative treatments during the Covid scare, echoes Baker’s suspicions, particularly those of a vaccine cartel at work. On February 16, he tweeted: “(The) vaccine cartel gets closer to realizing its dream of vaccinating 308 million egg-laying hens in the U.S., even though leaky vaccines are likely to result in new pathogens.” He says poultry vaccination has failed miserably in China and southeast Asia for decades because it breeds resistant strains and increases transmission to other animals. The U.S., he believes, is making the same mistake. According to McCullough, culling and the compensatory payouts to poultry farms — some $1.25 billion so far — have created a “perverse profit incentive.” Instead of stopping the spread, culling, he says, has led to the transmission of the virus to humans. He cites a New England Journal of Medicine study that found almost all human cases linked to such efforts. The connection to the agents of the Great Reset is evident. In an interview, McCullough says, GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, which is part of this bio-pharmaceutical alliance I’ve written about, said in 2021 that bird flu is the next disease X. And now the World Economic Forum (WEF), WHO, and CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness) – all have bird flu positioned as disease X. Like Baker, he alleges that the strain causing the current bird flu outbreak was gain-of-functioned. The Trump administration, first and foremost, needs to have all the gain-of-function and lab leak allegations investigated. Besides the Southeast Poultry Research and Kawaoka labs, many military laboratories need to be investigated for infiltration by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The suspicion may seem unfounded, but Col. Lawrence Sellin, an Afghanistan veteran and PhD in physiology who has worked with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), believes PLA infiltration of American medical research has been going on since the 1990s, with a steady trickle of PLA-trained scientists arriving to study or work at American universities. He alleges that the army’s Fort Detrick, Maryland, lab, where he spent four years, has long been a PLA target. He says Chinese researchers at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Maryland, have worked with the virology division of USAMRIID and Dr Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), dealing with dangerous pathogens which are part of China’s biowarfare program. These scientists, he alleges, have even received funds for collaborative research with PLA labs. The second major step the Trump administration needs to take is to disband the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR), something the president had vowed to do as a candidate in April 2024, if elected. As Baker puts it: “Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now.” The OPPR, created by Congress in 2022, advises the president on pandemics and other emergencies. On February 6, Trump nominated Col. Gerald Parker, a champion of Covid vaccines and gain-of-function research, as its director. Parker is a staunch advocate of One Health, and as someone who has spoken of strengthening the WHO, his views align with the globalist elite who are pushing for a Great Reset. Under the Biden administration, he was charged with crafting recommendations for rules governing research that could create riskier pathogens. He also headed the USAMRIID’s Fort Detrick labs, which Col. Sellin alleges has been compromised by PLA infiltration. Trump’s appointment of Col. Parker to the OPPR is at odds with both his promise to disband OPPR and to withdraw from the WHO. The third major step the Trump administration needs to take is to thwart the attempts of the vaccine lobby to profit from the bird flu scare. The risk with such vaccines is that they allow the virus to replicate in the vaccinated hosts and develop immunity, as well as to gain the ability to infect humans. Field tests of such vaccines may already have caused resistant viruses to enter the food chain. Former president Joe Biden had issued a $590 million contract to Moderna for developing a bird flu vaccine. Baker is convinced this should be cancelled, as should the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s conditional approval of a bird flu vaccine developed by Zoetis, the world’s largest producer of medication and vaccines for pets and livestock. The company, as might be expected, is linked to the usual Great Reset suspects — Pfizer, BlackRock, the Gates Foundation. Similar conditional approval is awaited on a bird flu vaccine for cattle, created by Medgene. McCullough calls the bird flu scare “a six-sigma event.” In real terms, it could devastate our food supply and cause mass starvation. With the Covid-19 conspiracy and its objectives coming to light, it’s time for us to oppose this dangerous iteration and say: “We will not comply!” Image: Free image, Pixabay license.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

March 16, 2025 21:48 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Developing the future workforce

Large-scale layoffs have continued in recent months, indicating ongoing economic challenges. Contributing factors include a decline in domestic purchasing power and growing external pressures, caused by the trade war. As the job market remains uncertain, businesses are calling on the government to accelerate the development of a workforce better suited to meet both global and local demands. More manufacturers, especially those in the car and auto parts industries, are likely to lay off workers or close this year as they succumb to a plunge in domestic sales, worsened by the impact of the new tariff policy and trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry. More than 100 factories were shuttered monthly last year for the second year in a row, according to Kasikorn Research Center. This rate will certainly continue in 2025, said Mr Tanit. "We should see a number of factory closures near the end of the second quarter," he said. The shutdowns will mainly be in the automotive industry, which has experienced sluggish sales since 2023, said Mr Tanit. Last year domestic vehicle sales plunged by 26.1% year-on-year due mainly to banks and financing companies' strict criteria for auto loans, concerned about non-performing loans given the high level of household debt, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). "This is a very serious situation for automakers when one-fourth of total sales disappears," said Mr Tanit. "Some auto manufacturers have avoided layoffs for two years, but they will let a number of workers go this year, with Trump's policy the catalyst." Trump announced last month he would impose a 25% tariff on car imports on April 2, but the levy on shipments from Canada and Mexico was paused for one month after taking effect on March 4. The FTI earlier warned of the negative impact on passenger cars and commercial motor vehicles exported to the US, while local auto parts makers are worried the new tariff policy will affect their exports to Japanese auto companies invested in Mexico. "We also export auto parts to the US, especially tyres popular among American customers," he said. Other industries, especially plastics, garments and furniture, will also be affected by Trump's tariff policy as the US-China trade war will worsen the influx of low-cost Chinese products, dealing a blow to local manufacturers and workers, warned the FTI. Mr Tanit said he does not expect an alarming increase to the overall unemployment rate in Thailand this year. However, roughly 420,000 people will graduate from academic institutions this year, adding more pressure to job-seekers in a highly competitive labour market. "We've been trapped at a low employment level for 10 years, stuck at this bottom level," he said. (photo credit : Somchai Poomlard) Prasert Taedullayasatit, president of the Thai Condominium Association, said many residential developers have trimmed their organisations for a while based on weak market signals over the past few years. "The layoffs this year stemmed from poor performance the previous year," he said. "Reducing staff is one way to cut costs. Some companies reduced employees in investment businesses that did not meet expectations." According to the 2024 financial statements of 24 listed developers primarily engaged in residential development, only three reported a year-on-year rise in net profit margin as a percentage of revenue, while 14 posted a decline and seven reported losses. One of the two companies that were reported to have laid off up to 40% of their staff saw their net profit margins plummet, falling from more than 22% in 2023 to just 11% last year. Another firm experienced a nosedive from 8.9% to just 2.3%. Mr Prasert, also chief operating officer of SET-listed Ananda Development, said it has frozen new hires for a while, and when employees leave it does not hire replacements. Therdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president of Asia Plus Securities, said the layoffs by property developers are a response to the market slowdown. "Layoffs are one strategy to cut costs and reduce expenses. There is no cause for concern," he said. This strategy of managing costs through workforce reduction reflects how developers are adjusting to a challenging real estate market, focusing on operational efficiency during times of uncertainty. Sutee Ketsiri, managing director of homebuilder Built To Build Group, said residential development has been unfavourable for two years, with a decline in sales prompting contractors to take on construction jobs from clients other than developers. "The number of home construction jobs, even from large developers, has shrunk significantly, causing many contractors to increasingly take on self-built home jobs over the past year," he said. Jackie Wang, country director of Google Thailand, said Thailand is experiencing a rapid technological shift across several industries. While some jobs may evolve in response to the automation of certain tasks, the greater potential of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in augmenting skills humans perform well, she said. AI can be leveraged to amplify human strengths in creativity, empathy and critical thinking at work, said Ms Wang. "For the tech industry, we continue to see strong demand for roles specialising in AI development, cloud computing and cybersecurity, to name a few. At Google, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas, such as AI and cloud," she said. Ms Wang said for students or those looking to prepare for the AI-driven future, foundational skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking will be even more important in this dynamic environment. People should also have a good understanding of AI tools, she said. "We have recommended governments invest in building an AI-ready workforce by adapting skills programmes across sectors, developing national AI training and support programmes, and establishing public-private partnerships to scale these programmes and make them accessible to all workers," said Ms Wang. "We are committed to working with partners on this issue. For instance, our digital training programme Samart Skills has trained 13,000 students and job-seekers in Thailand thus far." She said over the past five years, Google trained more than 3.6 million Thais, including students, educators, small and medium-sized enterprises and developers. "AI presents incredible opportunities for us to evolve and create a more productive and fulfilling work environment, while boosting local economic growth," said Ms Wang. "I encourage people to approach AI with curiosity and optimism, and I am excited for the opportunities it will open up." Prae Dumrongmongcolgul, country director of Facebook Thailand, said the integration of AI has revolutionised the IT industry, driving a significant surge in demand for professionals skilled in AI programming languages such as Python, machine learning, data engineering and data science. This transformation is not unique to the IT industry, as AI has touched companies and organisations worldwide in different ways, she said. "However, we believe human-AI collaboration remains crucial to advancing this technology. By showcasing how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them, we can unlock its full potential," said Ms Prae. She said Meta has developed tools that enhance productivity, such as AI assistants that help write basic code blocks, allowing engineers to focus on more advanced tasks. Ms Prae said rather than replacing jobs, AI supplements them, offering endless possibilities. For example, AI can enhance medical diagnoses with accurate and efficient tools, or help business owners predict customer purchases, as well as create new professions, just as the internet gave rise to web development, she said. "As technology evolves, jobs change and new ones emerge," said Ms Prae. "Ultimately the future of work is not about replacement but augmentation, and we are committed to developing AI solutions that empower humans to achieve their full potential." Somchai Sittichaisrichart, managing director of SiS Distribution (Thailand), said the local tech industry still faces a shortage of workers, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud and AI. He said youngsters are not interested in learning tech skills, while emerging technology evolves all the time. The tech industry will likely continue to face a worker shortage, said Mr Somchai. Regarding concerns that AI will replace human workers in Thailand, he said it will not happen soon, but could start in two years. Vatsun Thirapatarapong, country manager of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Thailand, said the tech industry has robust demand for people with AI skills, which should continue to increase. AWS regularly updates courseware to train AI skills in the tech and non-tech sectors. The company aims to produce 100,000 AI-ready workers by 2026. Maneerut Anulomsombut, chief executive of Sea (Thailand), a Singaporean internet tech firm, said the economic uncertainty is causing cautious talent acquisition among Thai companies, including those in the tech sector. Every organisation prioritises recruiting individuals skilled in tech fields, she said.

(photo credit: Chanat Katanyu) Pun Paniangvait, general manager of Thai President Foods Plc, the manufacturer of Mama instant noodles, said the company expects to expand its workforce in line with the growth of its manufacturing operations. The company employs more than 6,000 staff and consistently implements new technologies including robotics to reduce the workload in certain areas of production, such as heavy lifting of ingredients. The use of robots lifts productivity and improves labour welfare, he said. For example, once the instant noodles are produced, robots handle the packing process and arrange the products on pallets, reducing the reliance on staff for various stages of production. A typical production line now operates with about 25 workers, a decrease from 30 in years past. The company also integrated AI to improve efficiency in administrative tasks such as summarising reports. The use of labour-saving machinery could help the company remain resilient amid rising labour costs, said Mr Pun. "The main goal is to keep the labour cost per unit of Mama manageable," he said. "By using labour-saving machinery, we can enhance worker productivity and potentially reduce the average labour cost per unit." Mr Pun said the company usually raises the daily minimum wage annually, regardless of government policy. He said the positions most often in demand are mechanics with vocational or higher vocational certificates who possess the skills and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Mr Pun said the government should offer more support for vocational education. Furthermore, he encouraged local businesses to collaborate with vocational colleges to provide on-the-job training, which could create a pool of skilled workers in specific areas and reduce labour migration to industrial cities such as Rayong. This could increase economic growth in the provinces and distribute wealth across the country, said Mr Pun. Thaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said restaurant operators with sufficient resources are more inclined to invest in automation technologies. She pointed to the rising trend of restaurants adopting self-service systems, like ordering through tablets or kiosks and implementing self-pickup stations. This shift not only decreases reliance on manpower, but also opens avenues for restaurant growth without the stress of workforce shortages, said Mrs Thaniwan. There are still many opportunities within the restaurant industry to incorporate technology, especially in back-end systems that help with managing raw materials and calculating food costs, she said. However, the industry will continue to hire staff, as the cost of implementing technology in restaurants remains high, said Mrs Thaniwan. "Even in restaurants that embrace automation, there is still a need for employees to monitor these systems," she said. "Workers must develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain this technology." Labour shortages are a persistent challenge for restaurants, leading some operators to offer daily wages that exceed the minimum wage, said Mrs Thaniwan. Thai workers are often hesitant to accept jobs in restaurants based on the demanding nature of the work and relatively low wages, she said. In contrast, foreign workers are more willing to take these positions, as earning 10,000 baht is a substantial income for them, said Mrs Thaniwan. She proposed restaurant operators restructure their pay systems to offer wages aligned with educational qualifications, though this may result in higher food prices. Mrs Thaniwan emphasised the need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's educational system to ensure the workforce is equipped with the technological skills necessary for the evolving industry. Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said total employment tallied 40.1 million in 2024, including 19.5 million in services and trade, 11.8 million in agriculture and 8.72 million in manufacturing. The unemployment total is roughly 390,000. Labour Ministry data indicates 19.2% of surveyed businesses, totalling 2,254 enterprises, are actively seeking workers. The sectors with the highest demand include wholesale and retail trade, automotive and motorcycle repair services, accounting for 36% of demand from 812 enterprises; manufacturing comprised 17.9%, with 403 enterprises hiring; and construction, making up 11.3% or 254 enterprises. Mr Sanan said the challenges include an ageing population, declining birth rates, low labour productivity, decreased worker skills, and a gap between labour market needs and worker quality. "The quality of education, both formal and vocational, needs improvement," he said. Given these challenges, the integration of AI in the workforce has become increasingly relevant, especially in the industrial and service sectors, said Mr Sanan. AI is recognised for its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labour costs. He pointed to China's initiative to introduce AI courses in primary and secondary education in Beijing, aimed at positioning the nation as a future technological superpower. "This approach offers a valuable model for the Thai government to consider when formulating labour and education policies that can enhance Thailand's labour productivity in line with future demands," said Mr Sanan. "Establishing AI training institutes in provinces is an essential step to equip the future workforce." Employers will continue to rely on human talent, as qualities like creativity, craftsmanship, effective communication and the ability to solve intricate problems remain beyond the reach of AI, he said.

Title: Microsoft's 1986 IPO

David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home » Retro Computing » Microsoft’s 1986 IPO On March 13, 1986, Microsoft shook up the financial world, and to some degree, we are still feeling the reverberations from that 40 years later. That was the day of Microsoft’s very successful IPO. The hunt for the next Microsoft began immediately, leading directly to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century. Microsoft’s IPO initially valued company at $21.00 per share. It raised $61 million for the company, and put its market capitalization at $777 million. The price peaked at $35.50 per share before settling to $27.75 at the end of the day. Microsoft expected it to take weeks to reach $27.75. Bill Gates owned 45% of the company’s stock, which meant on March 14, 1986, he was worth almost $350 million. He had not yet turned 31. The next year, he became the youngest person to become a billionaire, before he had turned 32. Founded in 1975, Microsoft was an 11-year-old company at the time it went public. They waited so long because Bill Gates wanted to maintain control over the company as long as he could. By 1986, Microsoft had to go public. This wasn’t because they needed money. Their profit margins were enviable, at 34% of their pre tax revenue. Microsoft didn’t need the $61 million the IPO raised. The reason Microsoft had to go public in 1986 was because Bill Gates had been using stock to attract talent. Microsoft projected that by sometime in 1987, they would have 500 shareholders, which would require Microsoft to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effectively turning them into a publicly traded company, but without the benefits of going public in the conventional way. Backed into this corner, Gates agreed in late 1985 to pursue an IPO. Motley Fool greatly oversimplifies Microsoft’s early years, as do others. They’re better at SEO than analysis. Microsoft’s best known products in 1986 were PC DOS and MS-DOS, the text-based operating systems for IBM and IBM-compatible PCs. In 1986, Microsoft Windows existed, barely, but wasn’t yet successful. Microsoft’s secret was that virtually every computer on the market was running some Microsoft product. Its operating system powered the booming PC market. But Excel was the most popular spreadsheet on the Macintosh. Its predecessor, Multiplan, was a reasonably popular spreadsheet on other platforms. Microsoft Word was an up and coming word processor. Microsoft Basic was one of the most popular programming languages, and ran on virtually every platform. Sometimes Microsoft licensed software on a royalty basis and sometimes for a flat rate up front. Getting the flat rate up front shielded Microsoft from losing profits to piracy early on. But once Microsoft could afford to risk some loss to piracy, it was more profitable to take a royalty per unit sold. There were 60 million IBM and IBM-compatible PCs sold in the 1980s, and Microsoft collected a royalty on virtually every single one. Then in 1991, it discovered it could sell new versions of MS-DOS as upgrades and make money on each unit sold a second time. When Windows 3.0 hit the market in May 1990, the game was essentially over. Microsoft could sell you an operating system, a graphical environment, and versions of Word and Excel that ran in that environment, all running on commodity hardware that was getting cheaper by the quarter, if not the month. Although it would be a few years before other companies would give up, a monopoly in operating systems and office suites was inevitable before 1990 was over. The more successful Microsoft became, the more afraid of failure and anticompetitive it became. This led to legal issues in the late 1990s. Microsoft reformed to a degree and is more tolerant of certain competing products continuing to exist than it was in the 90s. Today, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (formerly Google) are larger than Microsoft, but the four companies are the only technology firms in the 2024 Fortune 20 list. The fifth largest technology firm is Meta, the social media company everyone loves to hate, at #30. To this day, young ambitious people enroll in school to get technical degrees in hopes of becoming the next Bill Gates, and venture capitalists like Kevin O’Leary and Marc Andreessen (himself a cofounder of a failed dotcom) prey on them. These ambitious programmer/entrepreneurs rarely get rich, but the venture capitalists have figured out how to make money even as the businesses they fund fail. Today’s entrepreneurs would do well to note that Microsoft made minimal use of venture capital. Microsoft’s only VC only owned 6.2 percent of the company. Gates didn’t trust them. If you’re thinking of trying your hand at being the next Bill Gates, keep that in mind. Another direct consequence of the Microsoft IPO was the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the subsequent recession. Fear of missing out on the next Microsoft drove up the value of anything tech- or Internet-related. Investors believed the next Microsoft would come out of that generation of companies. In the end they were kind of right. Two companies from that wave ended up matching and eventually eclipsing Microsoft. But it wasn’t exactly clear until a few years after the dotcom bust that Amazon and Google would be the ones to do it. Short-lived randos like VA Linux, Geocities, Cyberrebate, and Internet America were able to come along for the ride while the market shook out.

Title: Park Avenue supertall tower anchored by Ken Griffin’s Citadel begins long road to joining NYC skyline

The clock starts ticking Monday to win city approval for Midtown’s most ambitious development project — a 1.8 million square-foot,1,600-foot tall tower at 350 Park Avenue, to be developed by a formidable triumvirate of public and private wealth.The seven-month public review process known as ULURP begins on Monday for the team’s request for a relatively small increase in floor-to-area ratio, or FAR, which is a measure of a building’s size relative to the size of the land on which it stands, above what current East Midtown zoning allows.Unlike dreams for some other supertall commercial towers that might or might not get built, 350 Park appears to be a sure thing. It’s a a joint venture of publicly-traded Vornado Realty Trust, which owns the existing, unattractive Midcentury building at 350 Park Ave.; privately-held Rudin, which owns adjacent and equally unattractive 40 E. 52nd St.; and mega-billionaire investor Ken Griffin. Citadel and Citadel Securities, separate companies that Griffin leads, will be the skyscraper’s anchor tenants with at least 850,000 square feet. If city approval is granted, the partners can start demolition of the old structures when Citadel employees temporarily move out of the old 350 Park next year.The cloudbuster will start to rise with or without any additional tenants. Vornado executive vice-president for development and real estate Barry Langer said, “The magic formula to get a tower off ground is to have an anchor tenant and equity partners, which we have in the form of ourselves, Rudin and Ken Griffin,” he said. The total estimated development cost is $4.5 billion, Langer said. The environmentally sensitive, “wellness”-attuned, all-electric tower designed by Foster + Partners will be Park Avenue’s tallest ever, dwarfing the new JPMorgan Chase headquarters by more than 200 feet. Several steps are needed to increase the permissible FAR on the 53,000 square-foot lot from the current 15 to 25. The partners will tap air rights from St. Patrick’s Cathedral and St. Bart’s Church which they’re buying for a combined $150 million — which requires no public review — and contribute more than $35 million to the city’s East Midtown Public Realm Improvement Fund. To earn three additional FAR units, the project will include major public amenities: a block-long, 12,500 square-foot open plaza fronting the avenue and wrapping around to East 51st and 52nd streets, designed by High Line designer Field Operations; a five-foot sidewalk widening on each of the side streets; and a fine-dining restaurant on 52nd Street and a cafe on 51st Street. The alfresco plaza will sit beneath a forty-foot-high ceiling similar to the one Vornado installed at PENN 2, part of its redeveloped Penn Station-area complex. At 350 Park, Griffin “is intent on creating world-class office space for his team, with great natural light, column-free floors and access to amenities,” Langer said. He credited the city’s recent Midtown rezoning with “encouraging developers like us who have 1950s buildings with low ceilings” to replace them with 21st Century product. That was our [Vornado’s] motivation.” He said Rudin — “We are obviously friends” — was motivated by the fact that BlackRock, its main tenant at 40 E. 52nd. St., moved to Hudson Yards, “leaving a huge block of space to be re-leased in an older building.” The new tower design boasts a series of stepped setbacks on its east-facing side. The tapered form will allow optimum light and views on office floors. Some tenants will have access to private outdoor terraces. Foster + Partners senior executive partner Nigel Dancey said, “We got to know Ken at 425 Park Ave. [which his firm also designed and where Citadel has a large space.] He’s kind of a perfectionist about beautifully laid-out floor plates.” Dancey said 350 Park will provide “great diagonal views. We moved the core elevators to the west to create large floor plates on the avenue side.” The ULURP process begins with an advisory-only 60-day review by Manhattan Community Board 5. The plan then goes to the Manhattan borough president, the City Planning Commission, the City Council, with final approval by the mayor. Advertisement

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. A cargo ship sails through the Panama Canal next to the entrance of the Balboa Port, in Panama City, Panama, March 13, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Angus Whitley Mar 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) – Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: How Vently became San Francisco’s top event party planner

Time Published: 2025-03-16T16:18:22Z

When Nicolas Khonaysser, 26, moved back to the Bay Area after graduate school in 2024, he was thrown by how unfamiliar the city felt. He’s been in Walnut Creek since age 10, when his family relocated from France. As a teenager, he’d felt connected to the Bay’s thriving social scene. But after grad school, things felt different. “It was fragmented,” he said “You needed 10 different apps to know what was happening. And even then, you’d miss out on something cool.” He felt lonely. And he wasn’t alone. Data analysis from the Chronicle shows that 20-somethings are the largest demographic leaving San Francisco, with some citing a lack of connection as the reason. Jacob Wells, Khonaysser’s friend from Arizona State University, and some of his new connections felt similarly. Last May, they decided to take action, renting a six-bedroom house above a bar in the Excelsior. For Khonaysser and the others — five men and one woman — the house became a home, party venue, and the headquarters for their business, an events startup called Vently, which throws parties and lists events throughout the city. Khonaysser is the CEO. The goal? To help Gen Z, and everyone else, have fun again. And to make money by being Gen Z’s go-to events platform while they’re at it. The competition is stiff: Vently is up against legacy platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook Events, as well as newer players Posh, Lu.ma, and Partiful, which have collectively raised more than $50 million. Vently’s $500,000 in seed funding is comparatively pennies, but its party-forward, fun-centric brand has struck a chord with San Francisco’s dwindling 20-somethings, and the founders are hoping they can bring the city’s youthful energy back to life. Everything you need to know to start your day. When the friends moved into Vently HQ (which is also their home), they equipped it with three coffee machines, furnished the living room with cream loveseats and a 400-pound marble table, and decorated with porcelain vases tastefully printed with breasts, rehomed from a breast-milk startup that was moving out of the state. They installed a cold plunge tub on the deck, naturally, and a weights bench in the living room. To cap off the startup vibes, they hung a bedazzled purple Vently “V,” gifted from an investor, above the fireplace. They purchased an eight-seat Escalade so they could travel together. The month after they moved in, the team threw their first party. Khonaysser posted the invitation to Instagram: “Wine dinner. Eight strangers. … Dinner, drinks on us. Dm us.” Hundreds responded — nannies, tech workers, venture capitalists, local politicos — which confirmed his hunch. “People are hungry for connection,” he said. “They just need some help.” The night of the party, he donned a butler’s jacket, set the table, and waited by the door. All 12 RSVPs showed up, and from then on, “Dinner With Strangers” became a monthly event. Nowadays, it boasts a 5,000-strong waitlist. In the past year, Vently has promoted and hosted hundreds of events: Orangetheory workouts, bank raves, boat parties, a SantaCon takeover, viral “lookalike” contests. It has partnered with TechCrunch and the Golden State Warriors (“They reached out to us!,” Khonaysser said). The company has amassed 12,700 followers on Instagram and in November launched a platform where event organizers and venues can list and sell tickets, send text blasts, and manage their communities. Of course, living with cofounders — and hosting parties in the home — can put a strain on relationships. But Gargi Kand, 26, Vently’s head of growth and self-proclaimed “big sister” of the house, thrives on intensity. (Last year, she ran a marathon with no training. “Don’t recommend it,” she said. “Dislocated my knee a month later.”) Living in a party house with her colleagues has been generally low-stress, she said, noting that the guys are respectful and clean up after themselves. The only disagreements are over Khonaysser’s “pathological need” to blast the heat; the others forgive him because he makes a killer espresso martini. As for romantic entanglements, only Khonaysser is in a relationship. “If someone has girl problems, I’m the one they talk to,” Kand said. Jacob Wells, 22, who went to college with Khonaysser and is Vently’s COO, said he’s on standby if Kand needs relationship tips. “Gargi comes to me when she wants a straight-shooter opinion on her many dating problems,” he said. Vently’s evolution has led the founders to expand far beyond hosting parties: They aim to be the online platform of choice for any event in the Bay. Think Eventbrite, but with fewer fees, and for Gen Z. Andrew Wasilewski, CEO of The Faight Collective, an artist event space in the Haight, is a happy early Vently adopter. “Eventbrite’s fees are brutal,” he said. “We don’t just want random ticket buyers. We want to build a real, engaged community.” If Vently can streamline his team’s marketing and admin work from eight apps to one? “Game-changer.” The demand for a hub that centralizes local community events is real, said Nicolas Meader, a VC at Lioncrest Ventures, which backed Vently’s seed round. “The hardest time to make friends is if you move after college,” he said. “You go from having 20 friends down the street to no one, plus a ton of work responsibilities. Vently [helps] you get involved in the community.” Vently closed out January with its biggest partner event yet: the Quarter Century Tech Giga Party, a 2,500-person, five-floor conference-turned-club-night at Temple nightclub that ran from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. The team was hyped about the lineup, which included California State Treasurer Fiona Ma; VCs from Andreesen Horowitz, Sequoia, and Blackrock; and DJ sets from Twitch cofounder Justin Kan, and Arielle Zuckerberg (Mark’s sister). The night was beautifully chaotic: the layout was confusing, the acoustics made it hard to hear speakers, and attendees hadn’t been able to figure out if they should dress for a club or a conference. But there were many charming moments: the silent disco on the rainy rooftop, the hands that shot up when someone asked who’d used DeepSeek, the man in a cardboard robot costume doing the robot on the dance floor. It was a big night, but not Vently’s best party, according to some attendees, who referenced the 2025 New Year’s Eve masquerade ball, Hibernia bank rave in November, and the Halloween haunted mansion bash at a Palo Alto luxury estate. Khonaysser isn’t fazed by the growing number of well-funded event startups with which his company competes. “San Francisco is the best place to start something, the best place to party, the best place to make your mark,” he said. To drive that point home, Vently in January acquired issfback.com from an Andreessen Horowitz scout. In an odd twist, that website once redirected visitors to an October 2024 story in The Standard with the headline “SF is so back.” (We had nothing to do with it.) Now the URL takes you straight to Vently.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round.

Title: Gensol fast-charged Blu-Smart. But their ties are a governance puzzle

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: On 16 January, Refex Industries Ltd, a manufacturer of refrigerant gases, informed the stock exchanges that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Refex Green Mobility, had agreed to buy 2,997 electric cars from Gensol Engineering Ltd. Refex Green Mobility would take over Gensol’s existing loan of ₹315 crore as part of this transaction. Gensol Engineering Ltd also informed the same to the exchanges. Shares of Refex ended 1.6% higher the next day, while shares of Gensol remained unchanged. This transaction came under the spotlight after Gensol, a solar engineering, procurement and electric vehicle (EV) financing company, saw two rating agencies downgrade its borrowing to default earlier this month. Rating agency Icra even said Gensol is falsifying statements. Gensol denies any wrongdoing and claims that this sale should help reduce its debt, from ₹1,146 crore to ₹831 crore. So, why is there a problem? Many unanswered questions linger, particularly around the company’s ties with the privately held Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd, the electric cab-hailing service. Blu-Smart was co-founded by Anmol Singh Jaggi; the 39-year-old is also the chairman and managing director of Gensol. In Gensol’s EV financing business, the company buys cars and then leases them to other companies. Gensol acknowledges that it owns 2,997 EVs that are part of Blu-Smart’s fleet. But that’s not the complete story—Blu-Smart’s fleet consists of 8,000 cars and Gensol, according to people Mint spoke to, owns a meaty share of this number. While Gensol didn’t disclose the overall number of cars it owns, and the number it leased to Blu-Smart, a spokesperson for Blu-Smart stated that multiple lessors lease out vehicles to the ride hailing company. According to two investors courted by Blu-Smart, two board members, and one proxy advisory firm executive, Gensol’s lack of transparency about its close ties with the cab-hailing company, particularly around the money spent on cars and loans granted, raises questions around Gensol’s corporate governance practices. Essential details, including the terms of lease partnerships, remain shrouded in mystery. Above all, a Mint investigation reveals that Gensol’s balance sheet has been used to build Blu-Smart’s business even as the cab-hailing company continues to be a privately owned one. Mint reviewed Gensol and Blu-Smart’s financials, including an investment proposal made by the electric cab-hailing service to prospective investors in October last year. We also spoke with seven executives to piece together this story. Growing togetherJaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. View Full Image A file photo of Anmol Singh Jaggi, CMD of Gensol and co-founder, Blu-Smart. (Mint) First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned. The fuelSo, where did Gensol get the money from to expand its EV leasing business, which, in turn, fuelled Jaggi’s privately held electric cab business? In 2021, Gensol first received ₹35.55 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (Ireda), a state-owned company, for its EV lease business. In August 2022, Gensol told investors that it had received Ireda’s nod to buy 3,000 EVs. In January last year, Gensol said that Ireda had sanctioned a fatter loan— ₹513 crore—one that would allow the company to finance 3,800 EVs. An Ireda spokesperson told Mint that Gensol has utilized the loans given to finance cars for Blu-Smart Mobility. This implies that Ireda knew Gensol was building an EV ride-hailing business through Blu-Smart. At the end of December 2024, Ireda had unpaid loans of ₹470 crore from Gensol, according to Icra, the ratings agency. The modelWhy couldn’t Ireda give loans to Blu-Smart directly? Probably because Blu-Smart always wanted to remain an asset-light business. “No Asset Ownership Burden—Company Managed Cars", Blu-Smart claims on the third page of its 25-page investment deck sent to prospective investors in October 2024. Mint reviewed a copy of this document. The privately-held firm is yet to file its financials with the ministry of corporate affairs for the year ending March 2024. According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. View Full Image Blu-Smart EVs being charged at a charging hub in Bengaluru. The loansGensol buys cars, leases them to Blu-Smart, and tops it up with more loans to the private cab-hailing company. The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. Jaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned. The fuelSo, where did Gensol get the money from to expand its EV leasing business, which, in turn, fuelled Jaggi’s privately held electric cab business? In 2021, Gensol first received ₹35.55 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (Ireda), a state-owned company, for its EV lease business. In August 2022, Gensol told investors that it had received Ireda’s nod to buy 3,000 EVs. In January last year, Gensol said that Ireda had sanctioned a fatter loan— ₹513 crore—one that would allow the company to finance 3,800 EVs. An Ireda spokesperson told Mint that Gensol has utilized the loans given to finance cars for Blu-Smart Mobility. This implies that Ireda knew Gensol was building an EV ride-hailing business through Blu-Smart. At the end of December 2024, Ireda had unpaid loans of ₹470 crore from Gensol, according to Icra, the ratings agency. The modelWhy couldn’t Ireda give loans to Blu-Smart directly? Probably because Blu-Smart always wanted to remain an asset-light business. “No Asset Ownership Burden—Company Managed Cars", Blu-Smart claims on the third page of its 25-page investment deck sent to prospective investors in October 2024. Mint reviewed a copy of this document. The privately-held firm is yet to file its financials with the ministry of corporate affairs for the year ending March 2024. According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd.

The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively.

Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. Gensol buys cars, leases them to Blu-Smart, and tops it up with more loans to the private cab-hailing company. The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday, so the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Trump's election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of President Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party President Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture, so there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses.

Stocks rebounded on Friday, so the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Trump's election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of President Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party President Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture, so there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.

Title: On the anniversary of the dot-com bubble bursting, is history repeating itself?

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's "Beast Games" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies. On the agenda today: But first: 25 years since the bubble burst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent. As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels. The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years. There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s. Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. "In a bubble, everybody makes money," Belski said. Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore. While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about "a little" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon. Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year. Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com déjà vu. Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com. Read the full story. Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots. Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized. Plus, two employees explained why they left. Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession. Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund. Actions you can take now. Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on "low performers" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise. Demanding versus demeaning — BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right. Why firing them doesn't "raise the bar." Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector. BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000. How much those in PE make. This week's quote: "No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle." — A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment. More of this week's top reads: A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes — and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Why Is the Trump Administration So Obsessed with Shipping Lanes?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/03/why-is-the-trump-administration-so-focused-on-shipping-lanes.html
Time Published: 2025-03-16T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Trump administration’s focus with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure has been most visible in the Western media on the Panama Canal and Greenland but is occurring elsewhere as well. Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. As is often the case with Trump, he is only saying more loudly what has been US policy for some time. The US has for years worked to sabotage China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The US Marines shifted their focus to sea control capabilities as part of an effort to maintain naval dominance over China. [1] CSIS, 2018 So this is not unique to the Trump administration or simply the result of Trump’s reported interest in ships. It is US policy to encircle China, control global shipping, and have the capability to shut down maritime trade routes. Washington is now attempting to take or increase control of key global maritime chokepoints. Recently introduced legislation from a bipartisan group of senators is illustrative. Its stated aim is to monitor and counter China’s expanding control over strategic ports worldwide. There’s much attention paid to that “expanding control” by American think tanks and politicians, who throw around maps likes this: What do the numbers say? Here’s the Jamestown Foundation: While the United States dominates global maritime security, there is a huge disparity in the other direction when it comes to influence over maritime trade. Unlike the PRC, which controls around 12.6 percent of global port throughput through COSCO and CMP, the United States has no state-backed firms among the world’s leading terminal operators. In terms of global port influence, the United States would likely rank behind not only the PRC but also the United Arab Emirates (DP World), France (CMA CGM/Terminal Link), and Singapore (PSA International). Nevertheless, the US is calling it a “​​direct threat to American national security and economic interests.” More from gCaptain: The Strategic Ports Reporting Act, introduced by Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Ted Budd (R-NC), and Rick Scott (R-FL), would require the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive global mapping of ports considered vital to U.S. military, diplomatic, economic, and resource exploration interests. The legislation specifically targets efforts by the People’s Republic of China to build, buy, or control strategic maritime infrastructure around the world. That’s largely what the US is already doing. Let’s look at a few spots the US has circled as key to its goals. Panama Canal On March 4, BlackRock helped fulfill the Trump goal of “taking back” the Panama Canal when it purchased crucial berths on both sides of the waterway that sees about 6 percent of global trade passing through it. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” Nick Corbishley has more, including on US efforts to revive the Monroe Doctrine in order to squeeze China out of Latin America. But Panama ports accounted for only four percent of the deal value between BlackRock and Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. While it was a BlackRock-led consortium making the deal, it was largely the result of a US pressure campaign on the seller. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. It was more than just a blessing: Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. The story got more interesting on Thursday when Beijing, late to the party, made clear its displeasure with Hutchinson’s decision to sell to BlackRock. The website of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Chinese ministry in charge of the two special administrative regions, reposted a harsh criticism from the newspaper Tai Kung Pao towards the deal. What does that mean? Here’s more from Zichen Wang at Pekingnology: It is now crystal clear that Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison never coordinated with Beijing against Donald Trump’s economic coercion… The Ta Kung Pao condemnation, translated below, reveals Beijing’s concern that BlackRock, a U.S. company, will cooperate with Washington to impose additional costs on Chinese shipping or even threaten Chinese maritime trade… The condemnation didn’t ask CK Hutchison to unwind the deal but did describe the deal reached so far as “in principle.” The Hong Kong conglomerate has now been asked to reflect which side it is on – Beijing’s or Washington’s. Shortly after news broke that the US is drawing up plans to get its military on site at the Panama Canal — perhaps a way to keep the pressure on Hutchinson in case it’s thinking about trying to back out of the deal? Here’s NBC News: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. It doesn’t get much clearer than that. Greenland “Greenland is growing in importance as we find ourselves in a global competition with China and in a new technological revolution with regards to warfare,” Rebecca Pincus, director of the Wilson Center’s Polar Institute and a former adviser to the U.S. Defense Department on Arctic strategy, told RFE/RL. “So, Greenland is important from a missile-defense perspective, from a space perspective, and from a global competition perspective, in which shipping and maritime sea lanes are increasingly important,” she said. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus just on the shipping. The US used Project Ukraine to isolate Russia from the other seven Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US). Finland and Sweden are now, like the others, in NATO, and their Arctic regions are being further militarized. As a result, all Arctic states except Russia are NATO members. Greenland, as a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, is by default part of NATO, but there has been talk about independence, and it has in the past flirted with a closer relationship to Beijing — although China has largely abandoned most of its interest in in recent years. Some background there from the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs: China has shown interest in Greenland’s mineral wealth and proximity to potential shipping routes, but in recent years its presence on the island has dwindled. In 2018, China released a white paper detailing its Arctic strategy, including its intention to build a “Polar Silk Road,” in parallel with its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure investments in other regions. During the 2010s, Greenland courted Chinese mining companies to invest, but subsequent mining projects involving Chinese partners have stalled or failed. Pressure from the United States also helped quash Chinese bids to construct new airports and convert an abandoned Danish naval base into a research station. Though Greenland has expressed openness to working with international partners, China has not renewed its overtures. Greenland occupies a key position along two potential shipping routes through the Arctic: the Northwest Passage, along the northern coastline of North America, and the Transpolar Sea Route, through the center of the Arctic Ocean. As Arctic sea ice melts, these routes could reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the Suez and Panama Canals. These routes are economically unfeasible at the moment, but that’s expected to change, which means more stuff to fight over. From Antiwar: The extent of Arctic Sea Ice is now “more than two million square kilometers less than it was in the late twentieth century,” and “reductions in the amount of Arctic sea ice that survives summer melt have resulted in more newly formed ice (first-year ice) and less of the relatively thick, old ice that makes up the perennial ice cover.” Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof. South Africa We wrote last month about the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against South Africa and how it’s likely that shipping and naval base considerations are playing a large role. Just to recap: in South Africa this focus means a lot more attention for a small outpost in the Western Cape called Simon’s Town, which is home to the South African Navy’s largest base. Why would Simon’s Town help explain US pressure on South Africa? Here are Dr Frans Cronje, head of the Washington DC-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, and Rear Admiral Robert Higgs (Ret), who commanded the Fleet of South Africa from 2008-2010 and served as Chief of Naval Staff from 2011 to 2016 (he was also the first SA Navy officer to attend the US Naval War College), writing at Real Clear World: Simonstown’s contemporary importance is best understood as one of three points of a triangle that determines the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. That triangle is formed by drawing a 5,000 mile line northwards from Simonstown to Djibouti on the African east coast where the Bab al-Mandab Strait narrows the gateway into the Red Sea (and the Suez Canal beyond) to just 20 miles. The balance of power around that gateway shifted in 2016 when China was granted a lease on a naval base just more than a decade after the United States had secured a similar lease. From Djibouti extend the line 8,000 miles eastward to the Solomon Islands off the east coast of Australia. The Japanese, after crippling the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, sought to occupy the islands to isolate Australia and their retaking was a key allied objective in the liberation of South-East Asia. However, in April of 2022, eight decades after the defeat of Japan, China signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands. As the islands lie east of the confines of the two major “island chains” around which John Foster Dulles’ Pacific containment strategy was conceived at the end of the Second World War the Chinese pact is the starkest challenge yet to the idea of the Pacific as “America’s lake”. Extend the line from the Solomon Islands back to Simonstown to complete the triangle and territory within sees the passage of more than half of all sea-borne global trade with the triangle’s three points determining access to the Red Sea, the South Atlantic, and the Pacific. Fight for the Red Sea On Feb. 1, President Donald Trump ordered the first airstrike of his presidency, against alleged senior Islamic State commanders in northern Somalia. That has continued: The US launched two airstrikes against Al Shabab in Somalia within a few days of each other. Not good. pic.twitter.com/4Ex3QMxqru — Dave DeCamp (@DecampDave) March 2, 2025 Why is the collapsed Horn of Africa country the recipient of so much violence from the “America First” administration? There are a few explanations. One could be found in friend of Trump Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post, which right on cue after the Feb. 1 airstrike was out with a story, “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” That would mean that the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. The other explanation is that the US is in the process of increasing its presence in Somalia with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsbile Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use force against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, we’re getting a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Fun stuff. Across the Gulf of Aden, escalation with Yemen is now taking place. The Houthi movement (Ansarallah) announced on Wednesday that they will resume attacks on Israeli ships over Israel’s refusal to allow into Gaza what the Western media calls “aid”: It’s not aid. It’s water. It’s electricity. It’s food. It’s medicine. It’s the stuff of life. — Eman Abdelhadi (@emanabdelhadi) March 3, 2025 And so the Trump administration is upping sanctions pressure and issuing threats to Yemen (and Iran with belief that will restrict Houthi weapons) and has redesignated Ansarallah as a “foreign terrorist organization” but is also saying that should sanctions fail to achieve their objectives, they will take military action. And so they are. Still Going After Georgia Elsewhere, the US hasn’t forgotten about Georgia. NEW! A bipartisan legislation calling for sanctions against those undermining Georgian democracy, known as the MEGOBARI ACT, has now made its way to the U.S. Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to take up in a matter of days 1/3 — Alex Raufoglu (@ralakbar) March 7, 2025 What’s MEGOBARI really about? Former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien was blunt in a July Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation hearing: allow the US to control the country with money pouring into media and NGOs and no China port. Here’s what he said: Two things. One is it should be clear to the governing party in Georgia that there is a path back, that having free and fair elections without violence against civil society, making whatever transparency requirements they want. This Foreign Agent Law, make it compatible with EU law rather than compatible with Russian law, and not have China develop a deep water port in Anaklia. These are steps that are really important for Georgia to take. The deep water port at Anakalia refers to China’s deal to build one there on Georgia’s Black Sea coast. So, once again US policy remains the same despite the turnover in government in Washington. China Counter Strategy Would the US really be so crazy to retry its Russia “isolation” strategy against China? That would inevitably mean a collapse of the global economy and a contest of who could withstand the pain longer. China, which is striving for autarky and would, barring future developments, have direct land connections to Russia and Central Asia for minerals, natural resources, and other needs, might not get as hurt as some like to believe. The US, meanwhile, would face product shortages — including in a defense industry reliant on China — and inflation that would make recent years seem quaint by comparison. More likely is that the bright minds in the bowels of the Blob envision a return to the China of 20 years ago when it helped enrich American oligarchs with its low-wage manufacturing but knew its place. China has other plans and has been preparing for years to withstand US containment efforts. The West’s failed attempt to collapse Russia turned out to be a major gift to China as Moscow and Beijing doubled down on their economic ties. Here’s a glimpse of the latest Beijing strategy courtesy of Kyle Chan at High Capacity: Chinese companies are racing to build factories around the world and forge new global supply chains, driven by a desire to circumvent tariffs and secure access to markets. Chinese companies have been building manufacturing plants directly in large target markets, such as the EU and Brazil. And they’ve been building plants in “connector countries” like Mexico and Vietnam that provide access to developed markets through trade agreements. Morocco, for example, has emerged as a surprisingly popular destination for Chinese investment tied to EV and battery manufacturing due to its trade agreements with both the US and the EU. While tariffs and trade relations may change over time, an expanding global production network creates more robust channels of market access for Chinese companies, particularly as local jobs become attached to Chinese factories. One might see this as the third phase of China’s development of global supply chains more generally. The first phase was about securing access to resources. The second phase—the Belt and Road Initiative—was about building the infrastructure for global production and shipping. And now the third phase is about securing access to markets. How can the US reasonably be expected to hold back this wave? It’s impossible — at least by peaceful means. That’s why China and Russia continue to insist on “strategic interdependence.” The only other option for the US, in attempting to be the lone actor that can determine global outcomes, burns the world down rather than accept others having a seat at the table. Notes [1] Background from The Forge: Aspects of the global order are being challenged by rising powers such as China, whose economic development and military evolution mean that even a superpower such as the United States can no longer assume Sea Control in contested areas. This reality manifests itself in General Berger’s guidance, where he is directs the Marine Corps to restructure in order to support Sea Control operations designed to maintain the Navy’s freedom of action. He sees a return of the Fleet Marine Force concept that was used to good effect during the Pacific Campaign of World War 2 where Marines were integrated into Navy Sea Control operations – in effect working directly for the Navy – rather than being the main effort with the Navy supporting them. Berger foreshadowed the release of a new concept – the Stand-in Forces – to support the US National Defense Strategy and the US Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) concept. The Stand-In Forces are designed to generate “technically disruptive, tactical stand-in engagements that confront aggressor naval forces with an array of low signature, affordable and risk-worthy platforms and payloads”. Thanks for the summer upper. Since Trump wants to time machine back to the McKinley era it would hardly be surprising that his admin is trying to revive Mahan and the sea power controls the world theory. But now that ships are increasingly vulnerable to attacks from above and below is that even possible? And when it comes to the Arctic the time frame suggests that Trump and his minions will be obsolete long before any of this becomes relevant. “Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof.” So is it all signal or is it just noise so the flighty Trump can pretend he actually has a foreign policy suited to the 21st century instead of he 19th? Here’s agreeing with Larry Johnson in Links that Trump needs to concentrate on that Peace Prize and detente–an achievable goal–rather than trying to be the new Teddy Roosevelt. new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. Presumably this is a factor in Trump’s drive to annex Canada and Greenland. The Northwest Passage becomes entirely within US territorial waters. Looking at that map showing Greenland, I’m going to guess that Trump sooner or later will be saying how the US needs Iceland too because of its strategic significance. The 390,000 people living there cannot be allowed to get in the way of Trump’s idea of security. Sorry, not sorry. Regardless. I can see a flaw with this plan for domination of the world’s shipping lanes by the US and that is the US Navy. They are not up to it. They are overstretched and undermanned with their ships falling behind in maintenance. Their actual numbers are going down and not much thought seems to be going into the vital support ships that the US Navy needs. The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ and work out how they can try to do it. And now here you are talking about patrol squadrons for Panama, the Galapagos islands, Greenland, Somalia and god knows where else. Where will the ships come from. What about the people to man them. How is the logistics of it all going to work? You try to control everything and in the end you control nothing. And Navies are not cheap. Some may scoff at the PMC complaining about eviction from obscure or not so obscure study projects, but how much more wasteful and less employment friendly is the Pentagon, with its many golf courses and fixation on aircraft carriers and reliving the Battle of Midway? Musk has at least been somewhat consistent in calling the F35 “junk” but we are still waiting for that promised drawdown of military spending. If Trump takes a far too familiar blob direction and declares us at “war” with his critics therefore traitors then the Pentagon will of course never be touched, if anyone was expecting that. It is a bewildering time–and has been for years. I was wondering the same, what good is all this naval manoeuvring if you don’t have the ships, and the US definitely doesn’t have the ships, not even a merchant marine, really. And no capacity to build them, either. Nor the materials to build them, now that Trump is waging tariff warfare. Also, it seems to me that Greenland was of much more strategic significance in the cold war when the “GIUK Gap” was a thing and submarine launched nuclear missiles were considered the biggest threat. Greenland, Iceland and the UK have all cooperated with NATO against this threat, so what does acquiring Greenland add to the equation which already established NATO cooperation does not? And does this mean Trump is going after Iceland and the UK next? And anyway, isn’t the sub threat now obsoleted with Oreshnik? Is the idea that the US just plans to blow all container and tanker shipping out of the water, is putting ASuW missile bases within range of all commercial shipping as part of what is expected to be a final big showdown? Oreshnik is not a strategic silver bullet, in spite of all the hype. It in particular is a medium range IRBM with manoeuvring kinetic RVs replacing the nuclear warheads. That’s it. In principle, there’s a very short step to doing the same with long range ICBMs, except then you’re stepping closer to the risk of inviting a massive counterstrike when you launch it because there is no way to tell on launch if there is a nuke in the nose or not, so any and all ICBM launches will be assumed to be nukes (and trigger the counterstrike – use it or lose it). The reason Oresnik is a game changer is mainly European – it tells the decision makers in Paris, Berlin and London “we can hit you and not destroy your city” (and/or their military bases), so it dramatically increases the range of Russian NON-nuclear capabilities with absolutely nothing to counter it on the other side. Like Sarmat and Avangard? They already have the same capability with their ICBMs… Re when I said ‘The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ ‘ Just read earlier today that the US Navy now has to send the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, to the Caribbean to patrol it. Maybe to stop the Gulf of America from being renamed back to the Gulf of Mexico again? https://archive.md/YsASc#selection-515.43-515.53 I thought they say “aye aye”. 🫡 All those strategic plans regarding shipping lanes are understandable, but how will they be implemented? 1) China reportedly has a shipbuilding capacity that is 232 times the one of the USA — which is itself negligible in absolute numbers on a worldwide scale. 2) The USA has an enormous backlog of repair and maintenance for the ships and submarines of its navy. 3) The navy is so short of technical resources and personnel that it must decommission ships before they even reached the end of their useful life. 4) Almost every shipbuilding project in the past couple of decades — littoral combat ship, Zumwalt-class destroyer, Ford-class aircraft carrier — and now Constellation-class frigate, all expensive boondoggles. 5) What regards the Arctic, the USA has yet to renew its hopelessly aged fleet of (one barely functioning) icebreakers — and since it is the first time in 50 years a firm from the USA designs and builds one, skills have been lost and everything takes much more time than expected. 6) The fleet of auxiliary ships has been whittling away, and, because of a lack of personnel, the navy is idling those essential logistical vessels. Far away naval bases need to be manned and resupplied, and must keep a reliable lifeline with the home country, and be able to rely upon a relief fleet could break a siege. It will be interesting to see how this will be achieved in view of all the aforementioned issues. Imperial overstretch on steroids aided by an unshakeable belief in one’s own propaganda. Looking at the economic and technological trends, say over several decades, any expansive US plan to maintain hegemony that requires growth relative to China are comforting pipe dreams. In part it is an admission that the capablility to provide a convoy system in time of war no longer exists. No cheap and cheerful escort carriers, no where near the numbers of anti-submarine corvettes needed. The ships most needed to be convoyed, the VLCC’s and gas carriers impossible to protect due to size and slowness. The Russian riposte is the Poseiden torpedo system targeted to block up the limited number of carrier repair harbours and to close the main canals and perhaps to force the closure of the Malacca Straight. Should be able to block up places like Simons Town as well if the yanks force their way in there. They have to keep hostilities below the official war level because they have no counter to enemy strategic weapons but have to damage their economies enough to make them toe the line. The possibilities of a mistake are incredibly high. This is just my opinion The Pres has struck his deal. It is clear that the President has fully positioned himeself to place blame upon others if things go bad (lifelong business and personal practice). He has made the deal that whatever the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has in its objectives is the plan going forward, he does not want to be bothered with the details, just give him the talking points so he can go back to acting the part he played on TV. In return, he is to made to look the good guy, the boss, the one with the bright ideas but never the clueless ones and, above all, never is he to hear rummors that he wears no clothes. So why is Trump so obsessed with shipping lanes? It’s all laid out in the 2025 Presidential Transition Project – great detail sprinkled throughout with national security being the rational control the shipping lanes… his Tariffs, his objectives, his talking points, his culling of the ‘woke’ his putting cost onto the NATO on europes dime ….on and on it goes. What amazes me is such agastatude and shock both parties pretend – when it’s all in the document – after-all many of the projects… as noted above have been a bi-partisan work — I suppose, to promote a common cause by hiding their support for Genocide and other bi-partisan attrocities and economic idiocy they seam to use their mutual complicity – a cross blackmail of sorts – the same sort of child arguments – No you did it…no you did it..no you did it loop to obfuscate through verbal complexity a glaring truth (to me alone maybe – my truth) A shining light at the top of the hill, or a true democracy, a true republic, is most endanged when stained with the blood of genocide, human rights abuses, unchecked power and a distrust/disdain for the people who have elected by those elected. – Their remains a chasim/ a void of legitimacey thrust upon this country by those driven by lust for power. The Trump has put his transparent 2025 Presidential Transition Project clothes on to play the part he wants. However, he is naked without all his boot lickers (probably the wrong anotomical part). A fraudulent king. Some parts of the 25 project to lend some credibility to my pontifications above. Make irregular warfare a cornerstone of security strategy. 1. Make burden-sharing a central part of U.S. defense strategy with the United States not just helping allies to step up, but strongly encouraging them to do so. 2. Support greater spending and collaboration by Taiwan and allies in the Asia–Pacific like Japan and Australia to create a collective defense model. 3. Transform NATO so that U.S. allies are capable of fielding the great majority of the conventional forces required to deter Russia while relying on the United States primarily for our nuclear deterrent, and select other capabilities while reducing the U.S. force posture in Europe. 4. Sustain support for Israel even as America empowers Gulf partners to take responsibility for their own coastal, air, and missile defenses both individually and working collectively. 3. Directly counter Chinese economic power with all elements of national power in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean to maintain maritime freedom of movement and protect the digital infrastructure of nations in the region. Prioritize a denial defense against China.U.S. defense planning should focus on China and, in particular, the effective denial defense of Taiwan. “Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us. President Donald J. Trump, 2019 State of the Union Address” partner countries match the U.S. tariff rate under pressure from the American President, and then under Scenario Two, in which the U.S. matches the tariffs of partners that refuse to lower their tariffs. Project 2025 is itself a throwback to the Reagan/Gingrich drown the government era but as you say it’s doubtful Trump has even read the lengthy document. But I do think it’s valid to say that Trump is trying to revive Reagan rather than the more intellectual Nixon. And guess what…so was Obama. Almost all of our presidents are figureheads in one sense or another. They used to call Eisenhower “the great golfer.” That said, Trump’s motives seem a lot more obscure to me. Maybe we need a Ouija board. The US Navy’s main mission, as presented by a retired US Navy admiral in an article in War on the Rocks, is to restrict access of enemy vessels on the shipping lanes. The Freedom of Navigation and protection of shipping lanes blurb is just that. The truth is just the opposite. Good to see that for now the Northeast Passage is not disputed… The arctic sea passage is in the 2025 Project for strategic resources and shipping lane control. Which is why Trump is demanding that Canadians hand their country over to him – he wants their strategic resources and have control of those shipping lanes. If he was smart, he might have suggested a sort of North American Federation to do this by but instead he just wants a land grab with Canadian resources – which includes its people – to help balance the US bottom line financially i.e. an Anschluss. ‘As of March 17, 2025, Canada’s national net worth, the sum of national wealth and its net foreign asset position, is estimated at roughly $17.5 trillion.’ For some people, that would be pretty hefty payout if Trump ever did it. For the bulk number of Canadians however, they would be net losers big time. In the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr almost sixty years ago, “My country is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” The US already controls Panama via a massive military presence: it can ‘invade’ Panama from within at any time, as it did in 1989. The US also maintains a sizeable military presence in Greenland. Thule AFB, recently renamed Pituffik Space Base, is home to B52 nuclear bombers, one of which exploded there in 1968. So all this talk about owning or controlling Panama and Greenland is for show. The US already owns them. A good video discussion. https://conflictsforum.substack.com/p/europe-and-israel-decline-and-fragment Did I miss any reference to Ellesmere Island? Given what I’ve watched about Trump messups re laws, he problem misspelled “shopping lines” in an attempt to get people buying stuff. I’m tired of Trump already, let him have his dreams but we all know that with him it’s Israel first, last and always. Your email address will not be published.

All eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.27%) GPU Technology Conference this week, where the company is expected to unveil its next artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said he will share more about the upcoming Blackwell Ultra AI chip, Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual conference, known as the GTC, during the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. On the earnings call, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” according to Huang. Analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.89%) said in a note on Wednesday that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. The analysts also anticipate the chipmaker to share more information on its next-generation networking technology, and long-term opportunities in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Read more: What analysts are saying about Nvidia GTC In January, Nvidia announced that it would host its first Quantum Day at the GTC, and have executives from D-Wave and Rigetti (RGTI-1.33%) “discuss where quantum computing is headed.” The company added that it will unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications.” The same month, quantum computing stocks tanked after Huang expressed doubts over the technology’s near-term potential during the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show, saying useful quantum computers are likely decades away. Jefferies (JEF+2.50%) analysts said in a Thursday note that they expect Nvidia’s product announcements at the GTC “to be another positive catalyst” for the company “as investors move past supply-chain noise and can once again get excited about the technology roadmap.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Federal Reserve will probably keep interest rates steady at its two-day meeting, which ends on Wednesday. But investors will be laser-focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference for any fresh remarks about tariffs and the central bank’s future course. “I don’t think Powell will be committal on anything” and will probably repeat the Fed will remain data dependent, said Jason DeLorenzo, whose Ad Deum Funds tracks options trading. “I expect a rally during the news conference, so long as Powell doesn’t say anything surprising, as hedges get unwound.” That expectation could be upended if the Fed chair takes the opportunity to say something fresh and substantial or if President Donald Trump says something that unnerves investors. Here’s what else investors will be watching. U.S. retail sales may have rebounded in February, according to StreetAccount consensus estimates. Expectations are for a 0.7% rise in the headline tally from January, when they’d fallen 0.9%. Stripping out auto sales, the gain may be 0.5%, compared with a 0.4% decline.

Title: China Ramps Up Criticism of Li Ka-shing’s BlackRock Ports Deal

Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. With assistance from Alice Huang. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Blockchain fragmentation and Ethereum's network challenges highlight Bitcoin's enduring appeal as a store of value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. Since the introduction of altcoins, after Bitcoin paved the road for them, we have seen many projects give 10x gains in relatively short periods. It has also been accepted that the crypto space oscillates between altcoin and bitcoin seasons, suggesting more investing opportunities down the line. A deluge of memecoins flooded the market as well, serving as a more robust gambling system (compared to online casinos). As crypto space lost $530 billion market cap over the last 30 days, it is prudent to examine its fundamentals once again. Is such a concept as ‘altcoin season’ meaningful moving forward? Is there more to cryptos than cyclical speculation? To answer those questions, we must first remind ourselves of narratives past. During the evolution of the crypto space, Bitcoin became de-facto the only proof-of-work digital asset worth considering, following Ethereum’s The Merge in September 2022. As a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), The Merge represents a cleavage in blockchain philosophies. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) requires computational resources, Ethereum’s PoS eliminates such barriers in order to boost transaction speed and efficiency. In other words, Bitcoin further differentiated itself as a store of value, while Ethereum focused more on cost-effective blockchain utility. At first glance, this may seem perfectly complementary, but there are several underlying problems that eventually reared their heads. Altogether, the PoW-PoS bifurcation translates into PoS fragmentation. If PoS-based assets, and PoS-based platforms competitive to Ethereum, are more reproducible, they can be launched with minimal upfront costs. With this foundation, there is no single altcoin asset to cling onto. Ultimately, with a low barrier of entry, this led to the fragmentation of the crypto market across +34,000 digital assets. From the Bitcoin-Ethereum perspective, as the two largest digital assets by market cap, PoS-led fragmentation manifests as a corrosive effect on Ethereum price level. To put it differently, Bitcoin’s key features, PoW and scarcity, are reinforcing Bitcoin fundamentals. In contrast, Ethereum suffers from network effect erosion from competing PoS chains, which offer similar functionality and incentive structure. Moreover, the increased complexity outside of Bitcoin is creating a barrier to entry from new capital inflows. Who can spend time filtering thousands of assets and bet that they will have staying power beyond one year? Even sophisticated investors leveraging popular futures trading algorithms often struggle to navigate the fragmented market effectively. In fact, this is precisely why memecoin mania gained traction. The complexity and fragmentation of the crypto market lends itself to thinking of digital assets outside their fundamentals. Instead, focus is then on celebrity endorsements, humor, viral marketing, which often turns into pump-and-dump schemes. Inevitably, this creates a negative feedback loop: But there is an even greater problem than that. Let’s assume that this negative feedback loop created by memecoins doesn’t exist. One has to consider if there even is a market for blockchain based solutions, as it was previously imagined. Through anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, governments around the world have expended great efforts to subdue the crypto ecosystem. Let’s quickly remind ourselves of key promises before regulative sweeps took place: Decentralization as elimination of intermediaries – nearly everything is now intermediated through fiat rails, including transfers from self-custodial wallets. Financial inclusion as access for the unbanked/underbanked – it is still more convenient to use legacy banking than blockchain tech, which is inherently complex and requires digital literacy. According to the latest EMarketer report, cryptocurrency payment penetration is hitting a wall. Although the number of crypto payment users is expected to rise by 82.1% from 2024 to 2026, this is from a tiny overall population base of only 2.6%. It may very well end up being the case that a digital dollar, a stablecoin like USDT, will subsume this effort entirely in place of a direct CBDC. Censorship resistance as a guarantee that transactions cannot be reversed or intercepted by governments and organizations. Governments regularly pursue innovative mechanisms to cancel such efforts, from debanking to the persecution of smart contract developers. Although Treasury sanctions against Tornado Cash were overturned in January, there is little indication that financial privacy will become a human right any time soon. In fact, indicators point in the other direction. 🚨 BREAKING: The ECB’s Digital Euro is set to launch in October. Key concerns include: – Real-time transaction tracking – Potential for payment blocking – Automatic tax deductions – Restrictions on cash withdrawals – Programmable money with expiration dates They couldn’t… pic.twitter.com/UvQH750gbl — Dr. Simon Goddek (@goddeketal) March 9, 2025 Altogether, this friction between blockchain-led solutions and governments leads to a contained market. And if a blockchain-based solution should be deployed, it will be under governments’ terms. Lastly, the entire concept of Web3 is dubious as a decentralized, blockchain-based iteration of the internet. Elon Musk’s DOGE revelations in the case of USAID funding clearly point to great efforts to push narratives, control narratives, suppress and de-legitimize dissent. A semantic, censorship-resistant Web3 is fundamentally at odds with governments’ needs to maintain authority and legitimacy as they push various agendas. To think that established information proliferation nodes such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook would be allowed to erode in favor of Web3 would be foolhardy. Any government needs centralized nodes to maintain power. This was amply demonstrated in the case of the TikTok ban. Although this video reels app is vastly superior to YouTube shorts, a leverage was pulled to sanitize it and make it less relevant. Again, this is another factor that contains the blockchain space to a micro-niche instead of propelling it into mainstream expansion. With this in mind, blockchain space is still worthy of engagement. Bitcoin will likely remain the main focus of crypto investing, owing to its unique, PoW-based network effect. Although the recent White House Crypto Summit was less bullish than expected, it was still positive in the long run. The decision to use seized bitcoins effectively removed this sell pressure from the table. Likewise, President Trump seems to be serious about ending the “war on crypto”. But looking at the crypto space from a purely innovative solutions perspective, which projects should retail investors consider during steep discounts? These five tokens should be considered as long play exposure during crypto market deflation. After all, it is unlikely that AI narrative will subside any time soon. In terms of top 10 revenue-generation chains during the market slump, crypto activity is clearly on the side of low-friction payment chains (Tron) and general purpose, high-performing chains (Solana, Avalanche). Ethereum still maintains high ranking due to its large market share within the DeFi ecosystem. In conclusion, what should crypto investors keep in mind moving forward? Due to inherent friction with governments, digital assets are unlikely to ever penetrate mainstream to a significant extent. But within the contained ecosystem, investors should focus on long term narratives – AI, infrastructure and chain performance. A truly decentralized Web3 should be understood as a niche play that will be countered by deep pockets of Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as centralized node extensions of the USG. By the same token, retail investors would do well to expose themselves to their stock options as safer bets.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

Time Published: 2025-03-15T14:02:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: The Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate — Part 2

Time Published: 2025-03-15T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Tech Iain Davis, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout In continuing to unpack the ideologies of the oligarchs who are part of the new Trump administration, Iain Davis examines how their ideas are being translated into policy. He considers the consequent infrastructure rollout that is preparing the US and the world for an imminent Gov-corp Technate within a multipolar world. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the political philosophies that have long been adopted and promoted by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and considered the implications, given both men’s obvious influence on the Trump administration. Musk is a high-profile advocate of Technocracy, and Peter Thiel is an accelerationist neoreactionary who favours, in particular, the Dark Enlightenment. Before you read this article (Part 2), I urge you to familiarise yourself with the explanations of Technocracy and the NRx (the neoreactionary movement) provided in Part 1. Otherwise, many of the references here will lack context. As we noted in Part 1, Thiel and Musk are part of the oligarchic class by virtue of being invited to join a network led by other oligarchs whose stratospheric wealth far surpasses that of the names published on the “richest people in the world” lists. Welcomed into their exclusive club, Thiel and Musk are made men. In Part 2, we will explore how the political philosophies and the associated economic theories of Thiel and Musk are shaping public policy. Keep in mind that these two men are far from alone in attempting to create an American gov-corp Technate. Although they borrow some libertarian ideas, there is nothing truly “libertarian” about either technocrats or accelerationist neoreactionaries. Their convoluted theories, once applied, could not be more authoritarian, more anti-liberty. Just as it is an oxymoron to describe Musk as a “libertarian technocrat,” so is it absurd to think of Peter Thiel as an “anarcho-capitalist.” Yet propagandists persist in encouraging us to see them in these terms. Witness a 2014 article in The Atlantic titled “The Libertarian Capitalist’s Case for State Power and Making No Money.” It is possible that people like Thiel and Musk self-identify as libertarians because they think “liberty” means freedom granted by — and to — the oligarchy. In Part 1, we referenced the Venetian Republic. The Doge of Venice was the ruler of the banking, finance, and commercial empire of the Venetian Republic. That is to say, the Doge was given the liberty to rule by the oligarchs of the day. We might wonder if the naming of the Department of Government Efficiency (the DOGE) that Musk leads deliberately references the Venetian magistrate. Some say it does, while others suggest another possibility. Created as a joke in 2013 by cryptographers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the Dogecoin, a memecoin, has seen its price and market cap soar and fluctuate wildly thanks in no small measure to Elon Musk’s comments about it. Much of Musk’s talk about Dogecoin has been deliberately provocative. For example, in 2019 he declared himself the “former CEO of Dogecoin,” though that was never the case. His social media posts alone have provoked major changes in the price of Dogecoin. Musk has also aggressively hiked its value by, for instance, hinting it might become the basis of the proposed “X pay” payment system on his newly acquired ‘X’ platform — formerly Twitter. Musk encouraged bullish investment in Dogecoin. Of course, just because someone encourages you to do something that doesn’t negate your personal responsibility to conduct due diligence. When some investors lost their shirts, as Dogecoin prices tumbled, they tried to sue Musk in 2022 with a potential $258 billion class action lawsuit. The case was dismissed last year. The judge ruled that Musk’s comments were just “aspirational and puffery, not factual and susceptible to being falsified.” Though it is worth noting the offhand comments of one man took the Dogecoin from a literal joke — a crypto parody — to achieving a market capitalisation of $14.5 billion in 2021. If there is an in-joke to the naming of the DOGE, nominally led by Elon Musk, some argue it is Musk’s fondness for the Dogecoin that is reflected in the D.O.G.E acronym. Yet, the symbolism of “the Doge ”— one who is granted the liberty to rule by oligarchs — is perhaps more conspicuous. Just as with the term “Accelerator” — meaning high-impact investment to accelerate the growth of a startup — an obvious underpinning ideology is implied, even if rarely discussed. In the introduction to his 2012 treatise, “The Dark Enlightenment,” political philosopher Nick Land highlighted the importance of an article written three years earlier by oligarch Thiel. Land wrote: One milestone was the April 2009 discussion hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual forthrightness. Thiel summarized the trend bluntly: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In a related article Thiel penned, titled “The Education of a Libertarian,” he was describing himself, and yet the personal philosophy he outlined in it was pure accelerationist neoreactionism. Thiel opined that “the prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed,” given that the government’s response to every crisis was “more government.” He also claimed that the post-WWI deflationary depression in Western nations was the last “sharp but short” shock to have allowed the alleged advantages of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” to flourish. After that depression, he said, so-called “democratic” politics had stifled the opportunities to capitalise on crises. As a result, Thiel said he no longer believed “that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world.” Asserting, in so many words, that democracies were useless, Thiel announced he had found a new life goal: In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy.” The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. For Thiel, the “unthinking demos” is us: the holders of the “neo-puritan faith” in progressive “social democracy” — the acolytes of the Cathedral (and the people whom Nick Land considers “inarticulate proles”). In Thiel’s view, we must embrace our “technoplastic” future, become intelligible, move beyond politics, and liberate capitalist innovation by swearing fealty to the gov-corp model. To this end, Thiel identified three “technological frontiers” upon which he could construct his darkly enlightened aristocracy.[1] Cyberspace was the first frontier he identified. There, Thiel focused on creating “a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution.” Cyberspace would enable “new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states” — and would result in a new world that would “force change on the existing social and political order.” [2] Outer space would be another Thiel frontier, where the “libertarian future of classic science fiction” could be built. [3] Seasteading would be his interim frontier, where the unclaimed oceans could be settled by humans. He called seasteading “more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel.” Seasteading would at least give us the time to develop the outer-space ideas on earth, prior to colonising the stars. These frontiers are necessary, Thiel insisted, because “we are in a deadly race between politics and technology.” He concluded: We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person [Trump?] who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. [Emphasis added.] Between 2006 and 2012, Thiel was instrumental in organising the Singularity Summits convened by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute — originally the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) — in partnership with Stanford University. Thiel provided much of the funding. Thiel cannot be both an advocate of accelerationist neoreaction and simultaneously an anarcho-capitalist — a libertarian. The two philosophies are mutually exclusive. In Part 1, we noted the technocrats’ rejection of the notion that “all men are created equal.” In a similar vein, Land, Yarvin, Fisher, and other accelerationists consider it essential to have a ruling entity, which can only be comprised of a few human beings exercising an unequal, additional right to rule. Both the technocrats and the accelerationists fundamentally misunderstand, or misinterpret, what the Preamble to The Declaration of Independence means. They completely ignore the second clause of the relevant declaration — namely, “that they [human beings] are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” “Equality,” in real libertarian thinking, does not infer a held belief that everyone is the same — though that is certainly how technocrats interpret the word. Libertarian “equality” doesn’t deny that people have relative strengths and weaknesses. It is not a rejection of either leadership or possible forms of meritocracy. It self-evidently means that every human being has an equal right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” These rights are unalienable — or inalienable. Our rights are not decided for us by others or limited by others, and no one on earth has any more or any fewer “equal rights” than anyone else. This idea is not difficult to grasp. It is central to the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, as clearly enunciated by Murray Rothbard (1926–1995): [N]o man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the person or property of anyone else. Anarcho-capitalism wholeheartedly rejects the initiation of the use of force — the aggressive imposition of claimed authority — by the state to coerce individual persons or seize their property. An example is the threat of fining or imprisoning someone who hasn’t paid taxes to the “proper” authorities. Anarcho-capitalism resoundingly rejects the state and all its dictatorial demands. By contrast, the proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise. Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. The term “technopopulism,” coined by political theorists Christopher Bickerton and Carlo Accetti, has increasingly been bandied about. While the US voters who elected Trump were offered technopopulist promises, this was clearly a sales pitch to entice them to support a gov-corp Technate. “Populism” can be broadly defined as a political attempt to “appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.” “Technocracy” is commonly said to mean “a government or social system that is controlled or influenced by experts in science or technology.” Neither left-wing nor right-wing, technopopulism promises a new kind of politics based on the belief that the more limited role of elected politicians is to put the appropriate teams of experts together to guide policy and to find technological solutions to social and economic problems, thereby benefiting “ordinary people.” But the apparent technopopulist offer to retain democratic accountability in the US is a deceit. The technopopulists say they want to unleash “technocracy” — with a small “t” — for the public good. But the new government system they propose is constructing “Technocracy” — with a big “T” — to serve the interests of the “American elites.” This is evident from The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (aka The 2025 Presidential Transition Project), Promise to America. It claims its purpose is to “defang and defund the woke culture warriors who have infiltrated every last institution in America.” While defanging and defunding woke warriors holds allure for American voters, the Project 2025 methodology actually subverts US “representative democracy.” The Trump administration is evidently closely allied with Project 2025 — denials notwithstanding. One such obvious tie: Trump has nominated Russell Vought to return to the post of director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and, by no coincidence, Vought was a key figure in convening the Project 2025 initiative. Project 2025 contributors were influential in Trump’s first administration and are no less conspicuous in his current picks for office. Project 2025 sets a presidential agenda for the first 180 days in office that seeks to empower the executive branch to meet these key goals: dramatically reduce the size of the public sector bureaucracy; privatise and deregulate the functions of the state; and liberate American technological innovation by “shuttering” it off from the China tech sector’s alleged infiltration. Thus, according to Project 2025, US technology can, if applied properly, be used to resolve all manner of social problems—from anti-American inequality of opportunity in the education system to woke propaganda infesting the media. In other words, American technology produced by Americans and for Americans can supply every long-sought answer to America’s ills. The power of American AI can be set free to, for example, police social media and tackle abuses such as Medicare fraud. Project 2025 offers the additional justification that the US is in an AI arms race with China and, therefore, must invest in AI accordingly. Trump issued a slew of executive orders following his inauguration. These days, this is not an unusual practice for an incoming US president. However, Trump’s EOs were clearly heavily influenced by Project 2025. Ironically, The Heritage Foundation and its Project 2025 are bankrolled by some of the “elites” the project accuses of betraying Americans. The Coors, Koch, Uihlein, Barre Seid, Bradley, and Scaiffe families are among the financial backers of both the Foundation and Project 2025. Rather than technopopulists it is the “TechnoKings” (see Part 1) who have been “assisting” Trumps selection of his administration’s personnel. Musk’s influence is well known but Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, is another influencer. Andreessen has not just been involved in making Trump’s picks for technology and economic related positions — areas where he perhaps has some expertise — but also for US defense and intelligence posts. Andreessen’s Machiavellian reasons for supporting Trump are obvious. As reported by the Verge, in July 2024 Andreessen spelled out that he and his partners were backing Trump, not because they shared any of the concerns voiced by Republican voters, but because they could use the Trump administration to deliver the regulatory environment they wanted for their project to succeed. That project is a gov-corp Technate. Not technopopulism but Techno-Optimism. In 2023, Marc Andreessen published The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. He explained precisely why he and his TechKing partners have seized their opportunity: We can advance to a far superior way of living, and of being. [. . .] We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology. [. . .] We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. [. . .] Combine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the techno-capital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.[. . .] We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to [. . .] ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever. [. . .] We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral, [. . .] as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems. [. . .] We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher’s Stone. [. . .] We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do. This is pure accelerationist neoreaction strongly influence by Technocracy. It is Nick Land and notably not Curtis Yarvin that Andreessen considers among the “Patron Saints” of Techno-Optimism. People like Thiel, Andreessen, and Musk are serious. They want to implement the Dark Enlightenment and are hell-bent on establishing gov-corp Technates. Their oligarch network is indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Currently, the most powerful nation on earth is in their hands. In true technopopulist fashion, it is perhaps Andreessen’s identification of gov-corp enemies that is most revealing: Our enemies are not bad people – but rather bad ideas. Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past – zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now. The eradication of these “enemies” reads like an American voters’ wish-list. Ridding themselves of the globalist’s overreach exercised through institutions like the WHO, the WEF, the UN and even NATO, is what they seemingly voted for. Andreessen attempt to associate ideas like “sustainability,” “stakeholder capitalism” and even “social responsibility” with communism is, at best, wrong, but appears to be disingenuous and mere pandering. This is the Dark Enlightenment’s technopopulist sales pitch. Escaping the grasp of the oligarchs was obviously a vote winner. But the American public has not escaped, on the contrary it has fallen into the clutches of the most authoritarian oligarchs imaginable. Oligarchs who, perhaps for the first time in history, not only have the political authority but the technology to make their gov-corp Technates a reality. This is a clear and present danger to all of us. Not just Americans. The same commitment to accelerationism and creative destruction is evident everywhere. In essence, gov-corp is the ultimate public-private partnership — a kind of inverted fascism where the private stakeholders use the claimed authority and violence of the state to achieve their goals. The construction of Technates is not limited to the US. Arguably China, for example, is already operating a public-private Technocracy. What is happening under our noses is no libertarian dream realized. It is the construction of an all-cognizant, all-controlling, all-consuming global network of gov-corp Technates overseen by a bureaucracy of multiple poles. On the surface, the new brand of technopopulist politics we’ve been examining seems to be anti-Establishment. At least, that’s how it’s being presented. It will use high-tech solutions and AI analysis to, for instance, deliver “lower taxes, much cheaper energy (green and fossil), faster growth and a productivity revolution.” Lest we forget, it will “make America great again” (MAGA). The trouble with this pipe dream, though, is that the ostensible “technopopulists” and avowed neoreactionaries behind it are actually installing Big “T” Technocracy and gov-corp as their solution. Not MAGA, but “Dark MAGA.” In 2020 Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen , and Coinbase established the low tax, low regulation nascent city state called Próspera on the island of Roatán in Honduras. The promotional blurb for Próspera read: Próspera is a startup city with a regulatory system designed for entrepreneurs to build better, cheaper, and faster than anywhere else in the world. The current Honduras government considers Próspera’s claim to enjoy special economic and regulatory status illegal. The previous Honduras administration under Juan Orlando Hernández (JOH) — who was later convicted of drug smuggling in the US — initially created three so-called Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs) of which Próspera is one. The initiative was fiercely opposed by the people of Honduras. The ZEDEs create a “special regime” where investors — Pronomos Capital (Thiel, Andreessen, etc.) — have absolute control of “fiscal, security and conflict resolution policy.” For all intents and purposes, the ZEDEs are startup gov-corps. In 2022, the incoming administration of Xiomara Castro Sarmiento started the process of repealing the ZEDE legislation. This is proving difficult because the Próspera ZEDE framework has a fifty year “built to last” clause in it guaranteeing the project for that period. Gov-corp investors instigated an $11 billion law suit to stop the Honduras government’s attempts to stymie their ambitions. The technocrat oligarchs deployed the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) mechanism against the elected government of Honduras. It is not unreasonable to describe their action as a direct threat to bankrupt the entire nation. As we’ll discuss, these oligarchs are not “nice” people. Whether they call themselves Christian or not. Many of the Próspera trademarks are held by NeWay Capital LLC, founded by Erick Brimen and Trey Goff. NeWay Capital formed the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which is similarly backed by Pronomos Capital — Thiel, Andreessen, Coinbase et al. In 2023, Trump proposed establishing ten so called “Freedom Cities” in the US. The mainstream media focused on his comments about “flying cars,” but he was really talking about embryonic gov-corp Technates. Reportedly, the FCC is now supposedly “in discussion” with the Trump administration to create gov-corp Technates across the US. Trey Goff said “the energy in DC is absolutely electric” and the ambition was to create “not just ten, but as many as the market can handle.” If approved by Congress, these “startup nations” — neoreactionary realms — will be city states like Próspera. The FCC calls these “special districts” Prosperity Zones. The technopopulist offer is to unleash innovation, onshore employment opportunities and revitalise the American economy. The FCC objective is to “accelerate the development of new urban centers.” Freedom Cities will operate in de facto US ZEDEs. The objective is to remove all regulation and allow tech-oligarchs the freedom to do whatever they like. These will be cities without limits, say the FCC and will be “zones of regulatory clarity and economic dynamism, [. . .] allowing entrepreneurs and builders to move at the speed of human ingenuity.” The accelerationist neoreactionaries and the technocrats are racing ahead. As evidenced by Andreessen’s Techno-Optimist Manifesto, there is no doubt what they have in mind. In 2022, Balaji Srinivasan — former Andreessen Horowitz general partner and former chief technology officer for Coinbase — published his book The Network State: How to Start a New Country. In it, he outlined the neoreactionary strategy to “escape politics in all its forms” and enable tech-billionaire oligarchs to form their own sovereign states—sov-corps. There is nothing pro-American about the NRx’s collective vision. Srinivasan wants the proposed “startup nations” to secede from the US and considers the US outdated and obsolescent. Shortly we’ll discuss Trump’s peculiar and seemingly unilateral declaration that his administration is intent upon grabbing Greenland — and Gaza apparently. We are supposed to believe that it is Trump who wants Greenland (and perhaps Gaza); that Trump is the great strategist playing some sort of 5D geopolitical chess game. But it is Peter Thiel and his oligarch network that wants to build a gov-corp Technate called Praxis on Greenland. The people of Greenland should be wary. There is no legal limit to the “built to last” territorial expansion of Próspera and the TechnoKing oligarchs have the backing of the World Bank to make sure their project does last. Following Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times published an adversarial interview with aforementioned political theorist of the neoreactionary movement (NRx) Curtis Yarvin. Outlining Yarvin’s contention that the US should be run as a corporate monarchy (gov-corp) under the leadership of an all-powerful CEO (Trump), Times‘ writer and interviewer David Marchese formulated his arguments on the suspected racist aspects of Yarvin’s ideology. The pair debated nothing of notable interest. The piece allowed Yarvin to forward some of his ideas to a wider public — but without disclosing any of their appalling implications. Meanwhile, the Times‘ Marchese posited a practically irrelevant counterargument. The legacy media is not going to point out those appalling implications. But this is what Yarvin, the leader of the NRx admired by Peter Thiel and other neoreactionary oligarchs, had proposed in 2008 under his pen name, Mencius Moldburg: Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma. The best humane alternative to genocide I can think of is not to liquidate the wards [people]—either metaphorically or literally—but to virtualize them. A virtualized human is in permanent solitary confinement, waxed like a bee larva into a cell which is sealed except for emergencies. This would drive him insane, except that the cell contains an immersive virtual-reality interface which allows him to experience a rich, fulfilling life in a completely imaginary world. The suspected racist streak in Yarvin does matter when we consider the implications of his gov-corp philosophy. But to imagine that identity politics provides any kind of intellectual basis to tackle the NRx dooms all such opposition to failure. If the objective is to resist accelerationist neoreaction, then harping on about the divisions between the progressive left and the right-wing — or “alt-right” — serves no useful purpose. Such arguments don’t even come close to comprehending what the Dark Enlightenment is. They only deflect the public from paying vital attention to real threats. The Dark Enlightenment is not racist. It is anti-human race. Its advocates do not care what colour gov-corp’s customers are. They seek, rather, to transform all of humanity, to bring an end to what it is to be a sovereign human being. Musk has already stated his desire to transform his X platform into a payment service provider and finance portal that, he hopes, could become “half of the world’s financial system.” Thanks in part to the headway made by Facebook’s Libra (Diem) project — more in this shortly — in 2023, Musk was able to start applying for the necessary regulatory approval for his financial domination project. Via its “Digital State” — again, we’ll cover this in a moment — Ukrainians are the Digital State’s “customers.” Musk wants to X to form the basis of a worldwide Digital State in which all users will be customers. Citizens as customers of government services is a key component of the gov-corp structure that neoreactionaries like Thiel and Andreessen desire. Just as we see the rise of the accompanying “accelerators” everywhere, so to the description of us as “customers” is seeping into the lexicon of governments the world over. In 2019, the US multinational corporation IBM, whose operations make it the largest industrial research organization in the world and whose chequered history includes assisting the Nazis to perpetrate a holocaust, explained why we all need to consider ourselves the customers of our governments: Today’s society is changing at a record pace as companies worldwide develop innovative solutions designed to make the world a more efficient and sustainable place. [. . .] Apps provide us with personalized information based on geolocation; we can shop online from the comfort of our couch, and organize our finances on our smartphones.[. . .] [I]t’s time to rethink and reinvent public sector services, [. . .] a digital reinvention helps build trust in the public sector as a brand: the government has your back. [. . .] At IBM, we’re there to guide you through the current age of digital reinvention. IBM, alongside CIA-linked Oracle, is a partner of the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and is assisting it to “accelerate transformation” to a new digital DWP service. For its part, as it proceeds to make a £6 billion cut, the UK DWP has stopped winter fuel payments to pensioners and has committed to freezing and restricting access to disability payments to the disabled. It is effectively lowering unemployment benefits for the sick and disabled and tightening the eligibility criteria for nearly all state benefits. At the same time, the UK government is pushing through the Terminally-ill Adults (End of Life) Bill — commonly referred to as the Assisted Dying Bill — to make it easier for the state to kill people who just can’t take it any more. All of this, according to the DWP, is part of its drive to provide a better “customer experience.” In 2021, The Biden administration issued Executive Order 14058 to improve the US federal government’s customer’s experience. Consequently, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS): [. . .] every person who pays taxes or uses Medicare is a customer of the federal government. Every veteran who uses a VA facility is a customer, every government employee that fills out their timesheet is a customer. The “customer experience” is how people experience and perceive our government services. It is what happens at the touchpoints when someone interacts with a government service. The customer experience can be a single touchpoint or several over a longer relationship between the “customer” and government. Each touchpoint is an opportunity for a positive interaction that adds up to a positive customer experience. The mainstream media is avidly pushing the idea that politicians like Trump are in charge. But, not only does EO 14058 illustrate the clear shift towards NRx gov-corp aligned thinking, it also shows that the transformation is not dependent on whatever administration happens to be in office at the time. Gov-corp represents the underlying philosophy driving this governance reinvention. Technocracy is the operating system for the impending Technates, regardless of who you vote for. The shift to digital money and “digital states” is key to the reimagining of society. Rather like the WeChat “everything app” in China, which operates as a public-private partnership between the government and Tencent — enabling the technocratic state to directly influence an estimated 1.3 billion Chinese customers –– the size of the X user-base gives Musk’s network an opportunity to construct his version of an everything app digital state. With an estimated 600 million users, Musk’s team is ready to launch his platform’s X-money payment system. It seems Musk doesn’t anticipate any regulatory problems, as another building block of the X-digital state is dropped into place. As X moves toward becoming a “comprehensive financial services hub,” working in partnership with Visa, the plan is to reportedly integrate digital currencies into the X-money system by the end of the year. The new interoperable global monetary system that is emerging has been designed to perpetuate the same old monetary game with the added benefit of AI surveillance and behavioural control. Investors can speculate — engaging in creative destruction — while protecting their digital finance empires by storing value in new digital reserve assets, almost certainly bitcoin. A so-called Synthetic Hegemonic Currency can and is being created, primarily using USD-denominated stablecoins underwritten by US debt. In contrast to the investor experience, it is unlikely to benefit many of its customers. Contemplating new methods of genocide to rid yourself of whomever you find “undesirable” is something we associate with tyrannical megalomaniacs not egalitarian democratic “leaders.” Unfortunately, certainly in the US, it seems the maniac tyrants have the upper hand. As many Unlimited Hangout readers already know, Thiel received investment funds from the CIA’s In-Q-Tel to accelerate Palantir. Part of that arrangement was for Palantir to establish a public-private partnership that would rescue a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Total Information Awareness (renamed the Terrorism-IA program in 2003). The purpose of the TIA was to create an all-pervasive US surveillance and population control system, with a heavy focus on pre-crime and other “predictive” interventions that would allow the state to justify any policy it chooses. The TIA project faltered when the US public learned of its intentions. State funding was officially withdrawn — which simply meant that the “less controversial” aspects continued under the guise of combating terrorism while the controversial projects went darker still. Ever since 9/11, “terrorism” has been the convenient PR buzz word for covering up a multitude of illegalities. The TIA program continued, unabated, to spy on the entire US population as a public-private partnership. Shortly after incorporating Palantir in 2003, Thiel and Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp reportedly met with the TIA’s chief architect, John Poindexter. The pair apparently impressed upon Poindexter that they shared his vision of a US domestic digital gulag. Yet, unlike TIA, which had been housed at the Pentagon’s DARPA, they would develop the TIA system as a private entity. According to New York magazine, Thiel and Karp convinced Poindexter that Palantir would “pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies — everything from human intelligence and cell-phone calls to travel records and financial transactions.” Evidently, In-Q-Tel’s seed funding followed soon thereafter. The CIA remained Palantir’s sole client until 2008. That is to say, Palantir enjoyed a monopoly due to its partnership with the state. Although Thiel’s cadre at PayPal — often called the PayPal Mafia — is supposedly responsible for ousting Musk from the company’s CEO spot, the rift between the two men seems somewhat overstated. Just as it is clear Musk hankers to install Technocracy, Thiel’s passion for the Dark Enlightenment is equally unambiguous. Both ideologies are mutually reinforcing. While there are some apparent tensions between Musk and Thiel, they are on the same path. Yarvin, for one, certainly values Musk’s contribution. Thiel and Musk are already megarich magnates on the order of the robber barons of old. As such, their respective Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy dreams, when realized, are intended to make them “sovereigns” of what Yarvin calls a “patchwork of realms.” The shared view of technocrats and neoreactionaries that society would be better if it were ruled by the likes of Musk and Thiel is an absurd and dangerous folly. We shouldn’t labour under any illusions that they’re nice. Anduril Industries CEO Palmer Lucky is another Thiel protégé who, having sold his Oculus VR headset business to Mark Zuckerberg, moved into the war business with the help of Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund. Through Anduril, Thiel is investing in a defence technology that maximises AI’s ability to kill. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk have both been instrumental in the development of AI. They combined forces in 2015 to accelerate Thiel protégé Sam Altman’s OpenAI as a “non-profit” research company. Today, propelled by the success of its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, OpenAI is valued at around $160 billion. Consequently, its “for profit” subsidiary, OpenAI Global LLC, is poised to make fantastic profits. OpenAI was pitched as a tool for developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole.” Presumably, OpenAI’s defence contracts and its participation in the Silicon Valley consortium bid to dominate the US military-industrial complex reflect this principled commitment. Or perhaps the ethical stance of the team behind OpenAI is about as plausible as their “non-profit” pretensions. There is every reason not to trust hypocrites like Thiel and Musk. One of those reasons is Palantir’s encroachment into national health-data systems, which is creating a virtual healthcare data monopoly in some countries — including the UK. This is extremely concerning, because it is obvious that patient care — or even basic human compassion — is not a priority for Thiel’s Palantir. There is nothing “Christian” about Thiel’s conduct. On the contrary, Palantir has actively participated in Israel’s Palestinian genocide and in the almost-complete destruction of the Palestinians’ healthcare system. In January 2024, Thiel and Palantir CEO Alex Karp agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and signed a deal with the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) to “harness Palantir’s advanced technology in support of war-related missions.” Of this deal the British Medical Journal observed: IOF operations have been described as a “war on hospitals” because of the systematic destruction of Gaza’s entire health system and 943 IOF attacks on healthcare. Hundreds of health workers have been detained, tortured, and killed. In addition to directly attacking healthcare, ongoing bombardment, forced displacement of Palestinians, and near complete siege of Gaza, the IOF has created a severe health and humanitarian crisis with high rates of malnutrition, infectious disease, famine, and dehydration. Several Thiel-backed companies — Palantir (seed-funded by In-Q-Tel),Anduril and digital surveillance company Clearview AI — have all evidently used the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a test bed for their technology. As noted by Stavroula Pabst in her Unlimited Hangout article, “How Peter Thiel-Linked Tech is Fueling the Ukraine War,” these companies are “taking advantage of the conflict to develop controversial AI-driven weapons systems and facial recognition technologies, perhaps transforming both warfare and AI forever.” Despite Thiel’s self-described libertarian and Christian beliefs, Pabst noted that the net impact of his venture capitalism couldn’t be more inhuman: [T]hese Thiel-backed groups’ involvement in war serves to develop not only problematic and unpredictable weapons technologies and systems, but also apparently to advance and further interconnect a larger surveillance apparatus formed by Thiel and his elite allies’ collective efforts across the public and private sectors, which arguably amount to the entrenchment of a growing technocratic panopticon aimed at capturing public and private life. Within the context of Thiel’s growing domination over large swaths of the tech industry, apparent efforts to influence, bypass or otherwise undermine modern policymaking processes, and anti-democratic sentiments, Thiel-linked organizations’ activities in Ukraine can only signal a willingness to shape the course of current events and the affairs of sovereign nations alike. Though Pabst’s piece was written in October 2023, her prescient observations have certainly been playing out. As we embark on 2025, it is clear that Thiel and Musk are among a troop of tech titans who have ingratiated themselves with the Trump administration. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. On their own, the ideologies of communitarianism, stakeholder capitalism, Technocracy, the Dark Enlightenment, and any other political ideology amount to little more than academic musings. Once implemented through the power and authority illegitimately claimed by the state, however, they couldn’t be more significant. Thiel has heavily backed current Vice President JD Vance and other Republican political candidates, such as Blake Masters, who co-authored Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How to Build the Future with Thiel in 2014. There is a nexus of Thiel protégés surrounding the new Trump administration. It is hard to see how Vance could rise to what some call the second-most-powerful position in the US were it not for the career-long support he has received from Thiel. As Thiel’s man, Vance’s admiration for the Dark Enlightenment is transparent. Adopting Yarvin’s “Retire All Government Employee” (RAGE) motto, which now seems to be embodied by the DOGE, Vance suggested that a future Trump administrator should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, [and] replace them with our people.” In 2017, Buzzfeed published extracts from the dump of an email exchange between Curtis Yarvin and Milo Yiannopoulis. In one email, Yarvin revealed that he had watched the 2016 US election results with Thiel and said that Thiel was “fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.” In his 2021 book, The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power, Bloomberg Technology writer Max Chafkin describes Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” of the “Thielverse,” according to a July 2024 article by Gil Duran in The New Republic. Of course, Thiel does not want it widely known that he supports the Dark Enlightenment of the NRx. With its aim to destroy the political realm and replace it with a corporate monarchy, the Dark Enlightenment, if fully understood by the public, would outrage them and would be, for Thiel, a PR disaster. Despite the potential for that to happen, Yarvin’s ideas continue to influence him. One such crazy notion was revealed by Yarvin in his talk at the March 2012 BIL Conference (an alternative to TED). Speaking as Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin advocated for gov-corp: There is no difference between a CEO and a dictator. If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia. Just a few weeks later, Thiel gave a lecture at Stanford, where he said: A startup is basically structured as a monarchy. We don’t call it that, of course. That would seem weirdly outdated, and anything that’s not democracy makes people uncomfortable. We are biased toward the democratic-republican side of the spectrum. That’s what we’re used to from civics classes. But the truth is that startups and founders lean toward the dictatorial side because that structure works better for startups. Ten days prior to Trump’s inauguration, Thiel used the Financial Times as an outlet to pontificate about the second-term President’s second-time promises to disclose details of the Kennedy assassination plot and to protect free speech, etc. Time will tell if these promises are kept. In the same article, Thiel laid bare the lineage of his own philosophy: Darker questions still emerge in these dusky final weeks of our interregnum. [. . .] The future demands fresh and strange ideas. New ideas might have saved the old regime, which barely acknowledged, let alone answered, our deepest questions — the causes of the 50-year slowdown in scientific and technological progress. Certainly from 2009 onward, Thiel has viewed politics as a vehicle to promote his accelerationist NRx-aligned objectives. Not because he particularly shares the values of any political party, either Democrat or Republican — or, for that matter, Libertarian — but because he recognises that people are programmed to feel comfortable as long as they believe whatever they support has something to do with “democracy.” Remember, Thiel calls us the “unthinking demos.” In 2014, reporting the evidence of some of the other links between Yarvin and Thiel, Corey Pein, writing for The Baffler, accurately lumped Thiel in with the NRx and called them collectively a bunch of “mouthbreathing Machiavellis.” Responding to Pein’s piece, Thiel said, according to an article published shortly thereafter in The New York Times: Actually, I found that vaguely flattering. [. . .] It was the full-on conspiracy theory. In truth, there’s nobody sitting around plotting the future, though sometimes I think it would be better if people were. This was blatant baloney. Thiel well knows there are people “sitting around plotting the future.” He himself maintains a web of connections with the plotters of which he speaks — and is obviously one of them. Thiel, as President of Thiel Capital, sits on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. The steering committee sets the agenda for the secretive Bilderberg Meetings where around 130 selected globalist delegates debate policy initiatives behind closed doors. Palantir CEO, Thiel’s associate Alex Karp, is also on the steering committee, as is former chair and CEO of Google Eric Schmidt and the President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Børge Brende. Consequently, it isn’t surprising that the main topic for debate at the last 2024 Bilderberg meeting was Artificial Intelligence (AI). Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been selected as the chair for the next Bilderberg Meeting and will also serve as chair of the next Munich Security Conference (MSC). The UK Guardian reports that his appointment marks a moment where the “influential” Bilderberg group is contributing toward the “concentration of control at the top of the Atlantic alliance.” Noting that Bilderberg brings together “prime ministers, EU commissioners, bank bosses, corporate CEOs and intelligence chiefs,” it was ridiculous for Thiel — a senior Bilderberger — to feign ignorance of those who evidently are “plotting the future.” Yarvin, in the earlier-referenced interview with David Marchese in The New York Times, was asked what he meant when he said Thiel was “fully enlightened”: Fully enlightened for me means fully disenchanted. [. . .] It’s a disenchantment from believing in these old systems. And the thing that should replace that disenchantment is not, Oh, we need to do things Curtis’s [or Peter’s] way. It’s basically just a greater openness of mind. Sure, the Dark Enlightenment rejects the “old systems” — i.e., representative democracy — but Yarvin’s diplomatic response cannot hide the fact that Thiel and other members of the NRx evidently know what they want to replace it with: gov-corp overseeing a network of sovcorp-managed functional sequences in a Technate instead of within existing nation-states. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. Obviously, any sane person would welcome the end of hostilities, but there is a clear subtext to the US policy shift. The Trump administration has emphasised the US potential deal with Ukraine to access Ukraine’s possible rare earth metal deposits as a “win” for US voters. He told the US public that there were “$500B worth of rare earth” in Ukraine. This is highly speculative. While Ukraine certainly has a lot of coal, oil, gas and uranium, much if that is in territory currently occupied by the Russian Federation. The estimates of rare earth metal deposits in extant Ukrainian territory were made around half a century ago and some, such as independent energy and mining consultant Tony Mariano, have significant doubts about the commercial viability or even the presence of the alleged deposits: As far as I know, there are no economically viable rare earth deposits in Ukraine. I have evaluated clay deposits that I thought had potential, but I found that they are not viable. This does not mean that there are none, but that more exploration and evaluation is needed. With regard to the minerals deposits that are known to exist in Russia’s “new territories,” including any possible if unlikely rare-earth deposits, Russian president Vladimir Putin has indicated his willingness to collaborate with the US again. In the spirit of public-private partnership (stakeholder capitalism), Putin told journalist Pavel Zarubin that Russia was ready “to offer [cooperation] to our American partners – when I say partners, I mean not only administrative and government structures, but also companies.” While Russians and Ukrainians continued to die, Kirill Dmitriev, former Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and WEF investment guru, and the current CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund — appointed in 2023 by Putin as special representative of the Russian president for investment — said that US energy corporations would welcome “access to Russian natural resources.” In 2014, the US enabled and supported Ukrainian Nazis (the Right Sector and others) to orchestrate the violent Euromaidan Coup that overthrew the elected president Victor Yanukovich. Ukrainian Nazi atrocities in Odessa and Mariupol immediately followed and marked the start of an eight-year-long war that Russian forces officially entered in 2022. From the moment Russia began its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, the US response was focused on seizing economic, financial and resource control of Ukraine in exchange for bolstering its military. It is not unreasonable to observe that Russian intervention enabled the US public-private partnership to capture Ukraine. With the Russian government now looking forward to working with its US partners, and given that the US state was instrumental in instigating the current conflict, one has to wonder what this war has really been about. Large US corporations, such as Microsoft and Amazon, began the process of digitising the Ukrainian government on February 24th 2022, the day Russia is said to have “invaded” Ukraine. This process has since seen Ukraine become a world leader in “digital democracy.” Ukrainian citizens are being coerced towards accepting digital ID, digital payments and into total reliance on digital infrastructure for many of their everyday needs. This has been met with great enthusiasm from globalist think tanks, such as The Centre for International Governance Innovation. As Ukrainian energy and technological infrastructure became more reliant on US corporations, global investors — through the asset management giant BlackRock — agreed to deals with the Ukrainian government to “structure the nation’s reconstruction funds.” In November 2022 BlackRock announced: BlackRock FMA [Financial Markets Advisory] will advise the MoE [Ukraine Ministry of Economy] on establishing a roadmap for the investment framework’s implementation, including identifying design choices for the envisioned setup, structure, mandate and governance. The MoU [Memorandum of Understanding] formalizes the discussions the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, held in September on the possibilities of driving public and private investments into Ukraine. The WEF arranged further meetings between Zelensky’s administration and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon alongside a consortium of investors represented by executives from BlackRock, Bridgewater Associates, Carlyle Group, Blackstone, Dell, ArcelorMittal, and others. With the financial architecture in place, and US and other multinational corporations set to capitalise, the emphasis shifted in early 2024 towards reducing the investment risk. War is the preferred business model for private military contractors (PMCs – mercenaries), or International Defense Companies (IDCs) as they are called in Ukraine. With Ukrainian government legislation in the pipeline to legalise IDCs operating in post-war Ukraine — coinciding with the Pentagon’s decision to ease restrictions supposedly placed on US PMCs (IDCs) working in Ukraine — US PMCs are just one corner of the US military industrial complex set to exploit the thirty-five-fold increase in the Ukrainian defence market created by Russia’s “invasion.” This is yet another tantalising Ukraine war opportunity for multinational financiers, such as BlackRock’s investors for example. Obviously, a “post-war” Ukraine is needed to turn these investment opportunities into solid ventures. With the US public-private stakeholder invasion of Ukraine complete, and the Russian public-private stakeholders ready to do business, Ukraine finds itself in a precarious position. It is almost completely in the hands of US corporations. For example, Ukraine is now heavily reliant on Musk’s Starlink for its internet connectivity and other communication systems. Indeed Ukraine’s “digital democracy” is now largely controlled by oligarchs like Musk. The Ukrainian Diia app is the product of a joint project between the CIA front organisation USAID and the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation which named Diia the literal Digital State. Diia is an “everything app.” It ties Ukrainian citizens to a centralised digital control system (Diia) through which they access government services. Their digital IDs and digital passports, driving licenses, fine levies and payments, their tax returns, tax accounts, their mRNA vaccine certificates and more can all be overseen by the Digital State. Of course, the overwhelming priority is to end the war. From a humanitarian perspective, at this point, nothing could be more important. Trump will almost certainly be credited if his apparent diplomacy succeeds and this will surely be perceived as more evidence of his great leadership by his supporters. We are supposed to believe that the Ukraine government’s stalling over Trump’s deal for US corporations’ access to Ukrainian rare earth deposits is the reason why the US has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s Starlink connectivity. The privatisation of a state like Ukraine couldn’t be more dangerous for its people. Musk was quick to point out that he could personally end Ukraine’s war effort, claiming the Ukrainian military’s “entire front line would collapse if I turned it off.” He later added this is something he would not do. Though obviously, given the Dogecoin debacle, Musk’s team fully comprehend the impact his comments have. In truth, there is a vast network of international investors looking at a post-war Ukraine with avarice. The rare earth deal is a sideshow to keep the public bemused. The whole nation state of Ukraine is ripe for the picking and the transition to a US satellite gov-corp Technate is already well underway. As previously noted, one of Peter Thiel’s long-term ambitions has been to create “a new world currency.” Fortuitously, one of Trump’s first executive orders was aimed at strengthening US leadership in digital financial technology. In it, he promised his voter base that he would prohibit “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] within the jurisdiction of the United States.” But there is a caveat: The order “shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.” As we know, legislative “laws” are subject to change at any time. Trump included in this EO a US government commitment to promote and protect “the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” [Emphasis added.] As extensively reported in the four-part investigative series on the cryptocurrency industry published last November by Unlimited Hangout writers Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin, rather than averting the societal risks associated with CBDC, Trump’s January 23rd executive order arguably portends something far worse. As Webb and Goodwin pointed out: [T]he policy of the Federal Reserve since last year has made it clear that they favor “private stablecoin issuance rather than official CBDC issuance.” With stablecoins being just as programmable and surveillable as CBDCs, and some stablecoin issuers like Tether already allied with U.S. intelligence and security agencies, the current stablecoin bill is poised to pave the way for the U.S.’ de facto CBDC and to ensure that Wall Street and well-established titans of digital finance like PayPal have the advantage. In particular, Thiel, PayPal, Facebook (now Meta), and US financial regulators have, for some time, been preparing for “a new world currency.” In order to understand the process they have been setting up, we first need to consider how this public-private partnership has apparently shaped the financial regulatory framework in the US. Thiel emphasised the “new world currency” idea in his aforementioned 2009 article, “The Education of a Libertarian” (the piece, you may remember, that influenced Nick Land’s conceptualisation of the Dark Enlightenment). In that piece, he wrote: [T]he founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. Peter Thiel sat on the Meta (Facebook) board of directors until 2022, when he left to reportedly “focus on political endeavours.” Upon his departure, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his personal gratitude to Thiel for “teaching me so many lessons about business, economics, and the world.” In 2019, under Thiel’s evident influence, Facebook announced its intention to launch a stablecoin payment system called Libra, which it soon renamed Diem. The project was co-headed by David A. Marcus, who moved to Facebook from PayPal in 2014, and by Morgan Beller, who migrated from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Libra appears to have failed. But, as Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin explain, that interpretation depends upon what one views the purpose of Libra (Diem) to have actually been. With an estimated two billion-plus Facebook users worldwide, if Libra had succeeded, it would have represented the potential “end of monetary sovereignty” as far as central banks were concerned. Apparently, the mere announcement of Libra’s proposition sent financial regulators into an tailspin. The unregulated issuance of “money” couldn’t be allowed to happen! Hence, Zuckerberg had to be seen being quizzed by pretty much the entire global financial and political “elite.” In May 2019, Thiel protégé Sam Altman wrote a blog post in which he said: Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner — let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency — and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency. I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency. In August 2019, at the G7 central bankers symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the main topic of discussion was what the Bank of England’s then-Governor Mark Carney called a growing “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS” [International Monetary and Financial System]. Carney told the gathered bankers and financiers that the “world economy was being reordered.” He said that the US dollar remained “important” in the short term but that “the game” must change to suit a “multipolar world.” Therefore, “the global reserve currency”—the US dollar (USD) — needed to transform into some sort of “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” (SHC). Carney added: While the likelihood of a multipolar IMFS might seem distant at present, technological developments provide the potential for such a world to emerge. Such a platform would be based on the virtual rather than the physical. [. . .] Technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency [the USD] from being displaced. [. . .] The most high-profile of these has been Libra—a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro, and sterling. [. . .] The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear [. . .] the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch. As a consequence, it is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies. [. . .] Even if the initial variants of the idea prove wanting, the concept is intriguing. It is worth considering how an SHC in the IMFS could support better global outcomes, given the scale of the challenges of the current IMFS and the risks in transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi. So, here is Carney saying that the Libra stablecoin raised the “intriguing” possibility of creating a new SHC “backed by reserve assets” but that Libra itself was “wanting” due to the lack of clear “terms of engagement.” However, if the requisite regulatory “terms of engagement” were “in force well in advance of any launch,” Carney raised the potential to create an SHC using Libra-like stablecoins. This, he proposed, could stave off challenges from new possible hegemonic reserve currency alternatives, such as China’s Renminbi, and create a USD SHC suitable for a “multipolar IMFS.” A month after Jackson Hole, in September 2019, Zuckerberg met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss “future internet regulation.” He was also invited to the White House for a “surprise” meeting. Then, in October, Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the aforementioned Libra (Diem) and was invited again to the White House — this time for dinner and this time accompanied by then Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The Trump administration didn’t think it necessary to disclose what was discussed, according to an NBC News report. Immediately thereafter, Zuckerberg’s Libra project began to shift away from a stablecoin based on “a basket of currencies,” and by 2020 it was more closely aligned with the USD. The Financial Times reported in late November 2021 that Libra would initially launch as “a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar.” Webb and Goodwin speculate, with good reason, that the whole point of Facebook’s purportedly aggressive pursuit of Libra (Diem) was not so much about the stablecoin itself but rather about creating a threat that would appear to warrant regulatory change. It appears the team behind Libra always anticipated the failure of Libra and the resultant formation of a regulatory framework for a potential USD Synthetic Hegemonic Currency. Going back to July 2019, two months before the Jackson Hole symposium, Facebook stated in an SEC filing: Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. [. . .] These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency. [. . .] As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. The fact that Facebook (now Meta) knew Libra might fail and was counting on new regulations that would open new digital financial markets could cause careful observers to conclude that Zuckerberg’s Libra project was intended to be an embodiment of “creative destruction.” While the Libra (Diem) stablecoin didn’t make it, the stablecoin market as a whole has done quite well, if one measures by market capitalization. The leading stablecoins are Tether’s USDT ($140 billion), Circle’s USDC ($44 billion), and the Ethereum blockchain-based “decentralised” DAI ($3 billion). Then we have FD121 Ltd.’s FDUSD ($1.8 billion) and USDD ($750 million), initially issued on the TRON blockchain. PayPal stablecoin PYUSD, issued by the Paxos Trust Company and currently at $480 million market cap, stands apart because Paxos is a fully regulated US custodian. What’s more, PYUSD is perhaps the most firmly 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, backed as it is with a mix of USD deposits, short-term US Treasurys, and cash equivalents. When the Nixon administration closed the gold window in 1971, ending the monetary system formulated at Bretton Woods in 1944, the USD became fully disassociated from any real intrinsic value (gold), though fractional reserve banking had already practically relinquished the dollar-and-gold association. The subsequent fiat currency monetary system has led to an enormous expansion of the money supply and ballooning of global debt. Those inevitabilities ultimately caused what Carney described as the “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS.” Carney recognised that the world’s leading holders of US debt were Japan and China. Both countries have been accelerating the process of dumping US Treasury securities (government bonds). Their bond market moves further threaten the dominance of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Now Trump has come to the White House with a fiscal policy package promising low domestic taxes and higher international trade tariffs at the very time that his country’s “exorbitant privilege” — the US economic advantage gained by funding its own deficit by issuing the reserve currency every other nation needs to buy — is receding. US public spending is fuelled by borrowing — by issuing government bonds. The traditional monetary view would suggest that the only option available to the US is to massively inflate the money supply — again! But, with its staggering $36 trillion national debt, and with other national governments increasingly unwilling to buy that debt (creating a lower demand), US borrowing costs seem set to rise and exacerbate the mounting debt problem. Bluntly put, the US dollar and the US economy would appear to be screwed. Unless, of course, the US can find some other outlet to absorb its debt. If it can, there’s no reason why the monetary Ponzi scheme can’t carry on. Obviously, it will continue to have a terrible impact on people around the world, especially the poorest — including the poorest Americans. But when have rapacious oligarchs ever cared about social deprivation? The total supply of stablecoins has now eclipsed $200 billion. In the US, Tether is currently the third-largest buyer of US 3-month Treasuries and the 16th-largest purchaser of US government bonds globally. Because they absorb US debt, stablecoins are seen as the key to stabilising US interest rates. The proposed Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has led some to suggest that it might become a regulatory requirement for USD-denominated digital tokens (stablecoins) to back their coins with nothing but US Treasury bills. If so, under Paxos’ custody, PYUSD is already well-placed to take advantage. The bitcoin (BTC) hard cap, embedded in its code, ensures that no more that 21 million BTC can ever be “mined” (that is, issued). Every four years “halving” occurs, thereby theoretically reducing bitcoin issuance. This is the polar opposite of the fiat monetary system, in which the money supply can, realistically, only expand. The resulting inflation persistently devalues fiat currency. Bitcoin, however, is inherently deflationary. It is a tempting store of value for oligarchs who have treated the fiat currency system as if it were their own fiefdom to control and have run it into the ground. Currently the top 21 holders of bitcoin collectively possess 2.3 million BTC, representing around 11% of the total bitcoin supply. At today’s prices, that is the equivalent of $236 billion in BTC holdings. The presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, author (or authors) of the original bitcoin white paper and possessor of perhaps as much as 1.1 million BTC, is officially the 19th wealthiest individual on the planet, worth around $91 billion. He may not be an individual but a collection of bitcoin founders. Some believe the name was made up by intelligence officials who could be behind the creation of bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which provides business intelligence and mobile software services and whose leading shareholders are Capital Group, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock, is the second-largest holder of bitcoin after Nakamoto. The third largest are the combined governments of the US and the UK, which reportedly hold $19 billion and $6 billion of bitcoin, respectively. Block.one — backed by Thiel — is the fourth largest, with more than $15 billion. The fifth-largest holder is Tether, owner of the USDT stablecoin, which has $8 billion and is the world’s largest trader of cryptocurrency. Tether has committed to investing 15% of its annual profits in bitcoin. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, grilled last March by Yahoo Finance, called BTC “the most valuable asset in the world” and “the endgame for anybody that wants to own the greatest property in the 21st century.” And, according to a blurb last October by Forbes senior contributor Billy Bambrough, who has the magazine’s bitcoin and blockchain beat, “Saylor has revealed [MicroStrategy’s] endgame [. . .] to become a bitcoin investment bank—and to buy up to $150 billion of bitcoin.” MicroStrategy investors are presumably eager to see that bid succeed. They’re aware, as is Saylor, that being bullish on bitcoin further stimulates demand for BTC and brings “the endgame” closer. BlackRock apparently agrees. The multinational investment company has seen its global asset portfolio increase to approximately $11 trillion, thanks in no small measure to its pivot toward digital currencies. Hitherto cool on cryptocurrencies, as other large investment houses have been, BlackRock now considers bitcoin in particular to be a digital asset. “We believe,” said CEO Larry Fink last October, that “bitcoin is [an] asset class in itself, an alternative to other commodities like gold.” Also, BlackRock is now among those advocating digitizing the dollar. Trump’s executive order establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has tasked that group with developing “a Federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, including stablecoins, and evaluating the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile.” Simultaneously, the trajectory toward setting bitcoin as the “new gold alternative” is well underway. Notably, the Swiss government has already started the formal process of amending Article 99 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to allow the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold BTC reserves. “On-ramps” are payment services that allow users to exchange fiat currency for digital assets like stablecoins. “Off-ramp” services allow users to convert digital assets back into fiat currencies. Using stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to the USD, greatly simplifies the process if you want dollars. That said, in a “multipolar IMFS,” Chinese and Japanese customers, for example, might not want USDs. Advances in decentralized finance technology (DeFi) are homogenizing global currencies. An effective SHC, with the USD set to dominate, is rapidly approaching. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates cross-border payment in USDC. This is fine if you want to off-ramp into fiat USDs, but if you want Euros, you still need to deal with the USD-Euro exchange rate (market price). This additional exchange reduces speed and increases the cost of the transaction (gas fees), thereby limiting scalability to non-USD customers. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, make use of Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi. This better enables cross-border transactions between stablecoins backed by different fiat currencies. Cross-chain interoperability protocols facilitate communication and data-sharing between different blockchains. Combined with AMM advances, cross-border stablecoin transactions are consistently becoming faster and cheaper. Circle’s EURC is a Euro-backed stablecoin fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). In 2024, researchers from Warwick Business School on-ramped in USD (USDC) and off-ramped in Euros (EURC) using Circle’s AMM. The researchers reported: Given that EURC is pegged to the Euro and USDC to the US dollar, trading in the EURC/USDC market should closely track developments in the traditional EUR/USD market. Indeed, we found that the blockchain market operates efficiently, with EURC/USDC prices staying within 20 basis points — or 0.2 percentage points — of traditional EUR/USD market prices. Furthermore, blockchain prices responded to macroeconomic information, such as interest rate announcements from the US Federal Reserve. The USD-backed stablecoins have primacy, and a USD-denominated SHC seems by far the most likely outcome. That said, some experts, such as former Binance.US CEO and 1Money founder Brian Shroder, predict a multicurrency stablecoin future. In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Shroder said, “We envision a global network powered by stablecoins representing all major currencies.” Equally, if interoperability protocols and AMM DeFi development continue to accelerate, such a multicurrency system is still likely to protect the USD. Those pushing USD dominance, such as the Thiel-led consortium behind the Global Dollar Network’s USDG stablecoin, with its proposed cross-chain interoperability, evidently have the edge. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) runs The Taskforce on Cross-border Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE Taskforce). The committee was formed in response to the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments (established in 2020 with the final stage three report published in 2023 — hereafter referred to as the G20 Roadmap), which, the BIS notes, seeks to enhance “cross-border payments’ speed and transparency, while increasing access to cross-border payment services and reducing their costs.” The G20 — short for Group of 20 — is an international forum comprised of 19 member states (including the US, the UK, Russia, China, and India) plus the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU). Formed in 1999, it is structured as a multipolar global forum of five internal groups with the aim of coordinating economic policy. The finance ministers and central bank governors of the respective G20 member states and of the EU and AU dominate G20 deliberations. An important contributor to the G20-and-BIS-aligned CPMI-PIE taskforce is Coinbase, which was accelerated into existence by Y-Combinator (see Part 1). Coinbase responded to the recent PIE consultation by making the point that all the G20 Roadmap targets could be met by properly regulated stablecoins. Coinbase observed that “a mixed-payments ecosystem” that supports “traditional bank rails and wholesale payments” can benefit from stablecoin adoption. The global digital ID network is being created from a range of “interoperable” but “vendor-agnostic” digital ID products. There won’t be just one global digital ID card or biometric ID product—such as a single facial recognition system. Instead, all such products and systems will export data using an agreed-upon machine-readable format. In the case of digital ID products and systems, they will comply with ISO/IEC 19794 Series and ISO/IEC 19785 biometric data interchange formats. Thus, it is entirely possible that a single global database, perhaps the World Bank’s ID4D or some similar global solution, could collect data from all the interoperable vendor-agnostic digital ID products and systems worldwide. The ID4D project is supporting the introduction of global interoperability standards that will be “capable of facilitating transactions in the digital age.” The International Organization for Standardization, abbreviated as ISO (not IOS), has an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. This standard, called “ISO 20022,” is explained as: [. . .] a global messaging standard designed to improve communication between financial institutions through structured, machine-readable messages. [. . .] ISO 20022 facilities interoperability and efficiency across payment systems, securities markets, and other financial domains. Its rich data fields and extensibility make it a cornerstone for modernizing global financial infrastructure. It goes without saying that the BIS — specifically its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) — is eager to embrace the ISO’s “payments data harmonisation,” which it announced last month. As noted by CentralBank.com, “A key factor in achieving more efficient cross-border payments is the use of the same data standards by all countries, and the ISO 20022.” ISO 20022-compliant stablecoins and underlying blockchains are emerging, according to a December 2024 article in CryptoNews.com. This innovation is being propelled by the multipolar G20 Roadmap and raises the potential of establishing a global “unified ledger” — or “shared ledger” — that effectively oversees every digital financial transaction on earth. In 2024, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, recognizable by its acronym, SWIFT, reported: The concept of a new, universal shared ledger for digital payments and assets is gaining interest as a way of transforming how transactions are recorded and settled. [. . .] In its Annual Economic Report 2023, the BIS presented its blueprint for a future monetary system, envisaging a new type of financial market infrastructure—a “unified ledger”—which could “capture the full benefits of tokenisation.” [. . .] [T]he shared ledger model could potentially help to improve the cost, speed, predictability and accessibility of cross-border payments — thereby supporting the G20 roadmap. [. . .] [A]n ISO 20022-based messaging layer will enhance the shared ledger proposition. A Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is being constructed, but, like its global digital ID counterpart, it is very unlikely to be one stablecoin or one digital asset or token. Rather, as Coinbase developers put it, the SHC will be a “mixed-payments ecosystem.” The SHC is going to be an interoperable network of “vendor-agnostic” digital tokens. Stablecoins are accelerating the SHC’s development. Interoperability, enabled by machine-readable data harmonisation, will revolutionise business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The race is on to seize control of the “new world” of regulated stablecoins. Peter Thiel and his protégés, working in partnership with Musk and others, have established a global network of tech and tech-finance companies that have been key drivers in creating a “new world currency.” That we find ourselves where we are today is no accident. In 2023, Tether’s new CEO, Paolo Ardoino, was under investigation by the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for potential sanction-busting financial activity. He submitted a letter to the committee in which he reported yet more evidence of the close relationship between leading players in the financial technology (FinTech) development community and the US defence-and-intelligence complex. Ardoino wrote: On December 1, 2023, we launched a wallet-freezing policy designed to significantly enhance the tools available for law enforcement agencies seeking to combat illicit use of stablecoins. [. . .] Tether recently onboarded the United States Secret Service into our platform and is in the process of doing the same with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These strategic relationships reinforce our commitment to supporting law enforcement. [. . .] We have assisted in freezing, as of the date of this letter, approximately 326 wallets totaling approximately USDT 435 Million for the Department of Justice, US Secret Service, and FBI. [. . .] We look forward to maintaining a close working relationship with law enforcement, policymakers, and regulators in shaping a secure, compliant, and resilient future for digital currencies. During the Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates in early 2022, commercial banks and payment providers facilitated the Canadian government’s demand to freeze protesters’ financial assets and disable supporters’ ability to donate to fundraising campaigns for the truckers. Similarly, the UK government is currently forming legislation that would allow authorities to access citizens’ bank accounts and seize control of their finances — under the guise of combatting fraud. In both of these examples of the public-private abuse of claimed authority, two mechanisms were and are needed to enforce tyranny: agreement (that is, the banks and payment providers’ willingness to collaborate) and legislation (either existing or new). But in a world of solely digital money, neither policy debates nor the passing of legislation are strictly necessary. Total surveillance of our use of money and the ability to programme our spending is innate to the “new world currency” —USD SHC. From humanity’s perspective, no matter where we reside, the most alarming aspect of digital currencies — stablecoins, retail CBDC, or otherwise — is their surveillance capabilities and, in particular, their programmability feature. Trump’s new executive order on digital finance suggests that instead of elected officials programming our money, this task should be handed over to multistakeholder partnerships. To understand why programmability is a risk to all of us, consider the words of Bo Li, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China and the current Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. In October 2022, Bo Li said: CBDC can allow government agencies and private sector players to program — to create smart contracts — to allow targeted policy functions. For example, welfare payments; for example, consumption coupons; for example, food stamps. By programming CBDC, [. . .] money can be precisely targeted [to] what kind of [things] people can own, and [the kinds of ways] this money can be utilised. Digital “money” can be programmed to automatically bar us from donating to the “wrong” cause or from transacting with certain “undesirable”individuals. Every transaction we make and all funds we receive will be recorded on the corresponding “ledger” (likely to be a blockchain) from which our financial activity will be monitored, analysed, and inspected. Such a system obviates the need for legislation to snoop into our bank accounts. China’s digital states — WeChat pay, and the similarly popular Alipay — are fully integrated with China’s e-CNY retail central bank digital currency (r-CBDC). China’s stakeholder capitalist approach to controlling its “customers” payments is not dissimilar to that currently being pursued in Ukraine—using its e-Hyrvnia r-CBDC—and a similar system is proposed by the Russian public-private state. The head of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, told the news outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the battle against cybercrime and financial fraud meant that the Russian retail CBDC — the digital ruble — would allow accounts to be blocked, depending on “certain rules.” Payment restrictions could be applied, transactions inspected and control measures taken “if necessary,” he said. Also adopting the stakeholder capitalism model, Aksakov said Russia’s “major telecom operators, cybersecurity experts and key IT companies,” alongside the commercial banks, would partner with the Russian government to put together these “new measures.” Looking to the future, he suggested “joint ventures” could include the “American banks,” adding that “Visa or Mastercard” could assist with the rollout of the digital ruble control measures. Like Bo Li, Anatolov also emphasised the social engineering potential of the digital ruble: Payments in the digital ruble can be linked to smart contracts, where the transfer or remuneration to the contractor is regulated by a computer program, not a person. [. . .] We are now focusing on using the digital ruble to control the targeted spending of the [fiscal] budget. [. . .] Should we convert maternity capital or child benefit into the digital ruble and make it so that they cannot be spent on alcohol and cigarettes? In my opinion this is a justified measure and such restrictions are necessary. The US is evidently taking a different path towards its proposed digital state, preferring cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for programmability. But irrespective of whether your government and its partners opt for the retail CBDC or the approved stablecoin route, the outcome is a digital surveillance and control system. Stablecoins are certainly no less programmable than CBDCs. Global outsourcing digital employment agency Rise observed: The programmability of stablecoins through smart contracts opens avenues for innovations such as machine-to-machine payments in IoT applications. [. . .] The future of stablecoin payments is bright, with ongoing innovations and increasing adoption promising to transform how we conduct financial transactions. These technological innovations portend much more than simply transforming “how we conduct financial transactions.” In its totality, interoperable, AI-controlled digital technology threatens to change every aspect of our lives. If it does, we should not lose sight of the fact that AI is programmed by motivated human beings who hold ideological beliefs. The Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB); advances in machine-to-machine (M2M) payments — with AI algorithms automatically deducting digital money from our digital wallets absent any human interaction –– and an interconnected network of smart homes on smart grids paints a dystopian future few of us wish to contemplate. Unfortunately, the enabling gov-corp Technates are being built. The digital currency powered smart home concept has already arrived. This is achieved by linking IoT powered homes to digital wallets overseen by surveillance of the smart grid to which they are attached. Howard Lutnick’s—Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce — investment in Satellogic, via Endeavour, places him and his partners in prime position to capitalise on what the WEF calls the “trillion dollar opportunity” presented by the Earth Observation industry (EO). Orbiting satellite networks harvest data from digital devices and the subsequent AI analyses of the gathered EO data is set to revolutionise pretty much every industrial sector. Now in office, Lutnick can be confident in his assertion that Satellogic and its investors, including Tether, are “uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry.” Just as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins in particular, are providing space for expansion of US debt, so to they are enabling accelerated investment in the development of the emerging “digital states.” Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, such as that being developed by Musk’s Neuralink, is bringing us closer to becoming “technoplastic beings.” It comes as no surprise that Peter Thiel is a Neuralink investor. Thiel also invests in Musk’s BCI competitors — Blackrock Neurotech is one. Again, Tether is also an investment partner of Blackrock Neurotech. There is evidently technological competition. On the one hand we have Musk’s Space X, Neuralink and X-pay, on the other we have Sattelogic, Blackrock Neurotech and Tether. But as we can see from Thiel’s investment strategy, it is the transhumanist and neurowarfare potential of BCI technology that excites technopopulist oligarchs. Competition stimulates development until the winning monopoly establishes itself. The programmable nature of the so-called “digital money,” combined with smart devices on smart grids, enabling precise monitoring of our energy use means that, de facto, “Energy Certificates” are being rolled out. Trump’s digital finance executive order does not nullify the threat posed by CBDCs. It simply diverts public attention away from the immense threat posed by programmable digital currency in general. Programmable, privately issued stablecoins are intended to avert the looming US debt crisis by absorbing US debt in cryptocurrencies. But the evident additional hope is that this tactic will give the US a head start in the race toward Technocracy. When Technocracy was designed in the 1930s, the scale of the surveillance and control system it proposed was soon discarded as unworkable. The idea of creating a bureaucracy capable of monitoring the energy use of every citizen and every business across a continent, using the technology of that day, was a fantastical proposition. Measuring a citizen’s or business’ energy usage via any kind of manageable monetary system, with expenditures controlled by linking the currency to identity, was simply not feasible. But today, not only is Technocracy finally technologically possible, the infrastructure for the rollout of Technocracy is ,as a result, being actively constructed. Technologically, such a dystopia is well within the realm of possibility. Do you imagine that the oligarchs behind the construction of the necessary infrastructure would never implement this digital panopticon? If so, perhaps it is time to ask yourself why they are building it. Is it simply because people like Elon Musk want us to live “lives of abundance”? To be clear: programmable money combined with digital ID is likely to enable oligarchs, via public-private partnership, to oversee “the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism”—that is, Technocracy. It will potentially give them total control of the distribution of “goods and services to the entire population.” In short, technological innovation has made a Technate eminently possible. The newly not-elected prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, is among the few, in the current crop of politicians, who is closely and directly connected to the globalist oligarchy. In a interview with Juno News, given shortly before he became prime minister, Mark Carney argued for the alleged benefits of said global oligarchy: I know how the world works, I know how to get things done, I’m connected. [. . .] People will charge me with being elitist or a globalist, to use that term, which is, well, that’s exactly, it happens to be exactly what we need. Carney’s proposed Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is intended to position the West in preparation for the emerging multipolar world order. It is obvious, therefore, that multipolarity poses no threat to globalist oligarchs. The so-called “global elite” have always been quite open about their ambitions, but Carney’s words suggest that they feel extra-emboldened at the moment. There is nothing new about their concept of a world split into more manageable “regions” or “poles,” but we do seem to be approaching the end of an inexorable path toward it. We do not have to take that path. It is not yet set in stone. Carney has openly told us that he and his globalist cronies have not haphazardly stumbled into his proposed SHC, nor have they randomly meandered into the clutches of a multipolar world order or its new IMFS. Conscious, deliberate decisions have been made, and specific steps have been taken, to bring about this state of affairs. There are people who insist that the push toward multipolarity is being led by the BRICS+ nations — in particular, the Russian and Chinese governments. President Putin and Paramount Leader Xi Jinping have been prominent advocates of multipolarity, for sure. Speaking in October 2024 in the lead-up to the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, Xi explained the multipolar vision. He said it is about fostering “inclusive economic globalization.” This can be done, he noted, by building “solidarity and cooperation” between countries. The BRICS (now BRICS+) project forms a bloc, or “pole,” of nation-states. It has already started to redesign globalism. As pointed out by former Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, who now chairs the New Development Bank (NDB) at the heart of the BRICS+ project, “measured by GDP, the BRICS countries have already surpassed the G7 in importance.” In truth, a multipolar world order has always been the penultimate destination prior to establishing full-blown, centralised global governance. The evidence supporting this conclusion is abundant. Renowned American historian, professor, and author Carroll Quigley meticulously catalogued the activities of the British/American oligarch network that was inspired by the imperial vision of the early-20th century Rhodes-Milner Group (also known as the Round Table Group). In a 1974 interview with Washington Post reporter Rudy Maxa, Quigley spoke about the “three-power world” that the network envisaged prior to WWII. The idea was that a transatlantic bloc and a united European bloc and an Eastern Soviet bloc would dominate a global “balance of power” structure. Following a 1956 Special Studies Project directed by Henry Kissinger at the request of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a 500-plus-page document titled Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports emerged (its copyright spans 1958–1961). The five reports in it aimed to define the problems and opportunities the US faced in the late 1950s, clarify national objectives, and develop a framework on which national policies could be based. The United Nations had already been established in 1945 (the UN headquarters was built on land donated by the Rockefellers), but, according to some of the panel report researchers, this international organisation hadn’t delivered on its goals. So, these researchers returned to the original prospect outlined by the Rhodes-Milner Group and suggested “a world divided into smaller units” [page 26] that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority” [page 26]: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] Fully developed, they imply a joint accord on monetary and exchange arrangements, a common discipline on fiscal matters, and a free movement of capital and labor. [. . . ] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. In October 1968, the Rockefellers supported the foundation of a globalist international policy think tank — the Club of Rome — to implement the “regional arrangements” that they had declared seven years earlier to be “no longer a matter of choice.” The 1973 third symposium of the WEF is considered by the WEF to have been an important moment in its history. At this event, Club of Rome co-founder Aurelio Peccei outlined the Club’s concept of the “sustainability of global economic growth” which, WEF delegates were told, required society to reconcile “economic development and environmental constraints.” Consequently, with this in mind, the WEF adopted “Klaus Schwab’s stakeholder concept.” In same year, September 1973, the Club of Rome wrote a confidential report titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System.” It proposed that the world be divided into ten “Kingdoms”—comparable to blocs, or poles. Though presented simply as an analytical computer model, the Club of Rome added a vision statement to its report: Our efforts in the immediate future will be concentrated on further use of the already developed [Kingdoms] model. [. . .] Implementation of the regional models in different parts of the world and their connection via a satellite communication network [will be] for the purpose of joint assessment of the long-term global future by teams from the various regions [Kingdoms or “poles”]. Implementation of the vision for the future outlined by leaders from an underdeveloped region in order to assess with the model existing obstacles and the means whereby the [multi-Kingdom or multipolar] vision might become a reality. More recently, World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab co-wrote, with Thierry Malleret, COVID-19: The Great Reset. One point they made in their book is that global supply chains are fragmenting due to global existential crises. They pinned the blame on a lack of cohesive global governance and offered a solution: The most likely outcome along the globalization–no globalization continuum lies in an in-between solution: regionalization. The success of the European Union as a free trade area or the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Asia (a proposed free trade agreement among the 10 countries that compose ASEAN) are important illustrative cases of how regionalization may well become a new watered-down version of globalization. [. . .] In short, deglobalization in the form of greater regionalization was already happening. COVID-19 will just accelerate this global divergence as North America, Europe and Asia focus increasingly on regional self-sufficiency rather than on the distant and intricate global supply chains that formerly epitomized the essence of globalization [page 79]. Shortly before the 2025 Munich Security Conference, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave an interview to Megyn Kelly where he said: [. . .] it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. [. . .] That was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. [. . .] [F]oreign policy has always required us to work in the national interest, sometimes in cooperation with people who we wouldn’t invite over for dinner or people who we wouldn’t necessarily ever want to be led by. And so that’s a balance, but it’s the sort of pragmatic and mature balance we have to have in foreign policy. Casting the multipolar world order as a confrontation between great powers but also a “pragmatic and mature balance,” Rubio’s comments were congruent with the view of the globalist think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—which has consistently promoted multipolarity. The CFR believes the international rules-based order (the unipolar model) is “disintegrating at an accelerating pace.” CFR fellow Thomas E. Graham sees five potential regional poles in a multipolar global governance system consisting of the US, China, India, Russia, and Europe. The CFR line of thinking is that the US can contribute to multipolarity through foreign policy that seeks to constrain China as a great power; nurture India as a power, preserve Russian power and promote European power. Europe is considered the greatest challenge by the CFR because, despite its economic and possible military might, it “lacks political cohesion.” Therefore, in January 2025 the CFR argued for a new US foreign policy mindset “to encourage Europe to assume the responsibilities of a great power [. . .], one that has the hard power needed to deal with most security contingencies in its immediate neighborhood.” In March 2025, the Trump administration’s very public press conference spat with the visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was immediately followed by the US supposedly withholding military aid to Ukraine. This was met with seeming condemnation from the US’ European partners who responded by publicly announcing an €800 billion ($841.5 billion) “ReArm Europe” plan. This gives further impetus to the EU’s long-held desire for European military unification. It seems that Trump’s order not to supply US arms to Ukraine doesn’t apply to Thiel-backed enterprises like Anduril. While Trump was telling American and European voters that the US would not supply arms, Anduril was finalising a deal with the UK government to send their Altius 600m and Altius 700m attack drones to Ukraine. It is hard to say if the press conference between Trump (the former reality TV personality) and Zelenskyy (the former actor and TV comedian) was entirely staged or not. Obviously, both presidents were, at the very least, briefed prior to their quite extraordinary public row. What is not in doubt is that the trajectory of the global policy response is precisely as modelled and suggested by the think-tanks. Elon Musk’s ‘X’ social media platform is, at the time of writing, heavily promoting Trump as the global peace maker who just wants to stop the slaughter in Ukraine. Consequently, the public debate swirling across the entire western media and social media landscape is polarising opinion between those who want peace and those who argue this is short-sighted appeasement and Ukraine must keep fighting to stave off “Putin’s aggression.” Meanwhile, the globalist plans for a multipolar world order are surging ahead regardless of which of those two, pre-determined options is championed by the US or any other government. Political leaders, influential financiers, and representatives of policy think tanks across the West have evidently been planning for some time, even enthusiastically endorsing, construction of a regionalised multipolar world order. Their fundamentally globalist project is the latest iteration of the oligarchs’ persistent dream: global governance under their exclusive control. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is ostensibly a transatlantic forum where hi-ranking so-called “thought leaders” engage in a “marketplace of ideas.” The self-appointed glitterati discuss, plan and agree security and defence policy trajectories. The theme of MSC 2025 was “Multipolarization.” In the executive summary for the Munich Security Report 2025 we are told that “multipolarization is a fact.” Again, presenting us with the idea that things just happen organically: there is no design. We are given to understand that those who are positive about multipolarity see “opportunities for more inclusive global governance and greater constraints on Washington.” Whereas, those who are more pessimistic believe it “increases the risk of disorder.” The report notes the international enthusiasm for the United Nations 2024 Pact for the Future, replete with its Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Following the UN’s “quiet revolution,” the Pact is grounded in stakeholder capitalism’s public-private partnerships and “draws on the energy and expertise of governments, civil society and other key partners.” The UN Pact promises more public-private global censorship, centralised world economic and financial control partnerships (global taxation), and firmer mechanisms for global governance partnerships to seize control of nation states as deemed necessary. The MSC thought leaders conclude “for this cooperation [UN Pact] to materialize, the world could well use some ‘depolarization’.” The evident plan is for the global order to undergo a process of creative destruction to deterritorialize it in its current form and reterritorialize it as a more efficient multipolar global governance structure. To this end the MSC report notes: The next four years will show whether a more selectively engaged US fuels or contains global disorder. As other actors will (have to) step up to fill the gap, the multipolarization of the international system could accelerate. Despite US policy decisions supposedly being designed to confront and oppose China, again, as a result of the same US policy decisions, China has shown it is ready to “fill the gap.” In his MSC speech the head of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission — China’s foreign minister — H.E. Wang Yi said: [. . .] we should work for an equal and orderly multipolar world. [. . .] China will surely be a factor of certainty in this multipolar system, and strive to be a steadfast constructive force in a changing world. [. . .] The U.N. is at the core of practicing multilateralism and advancing global governance. [. . .] We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N. J.D. Vance address to the MSC has been reported as harsh criticism of European censorship of its citizen’s and its media, especially with reference to the censorship of US commentators. Within his criticisms, Vance also advocated construction of a European “pole”: [. . .] the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. [. . .] [W]e think it’s an important part of being in a shared alliance together that the Europeans step up while America focuses on areas of the world that are in great danger. The extremely rapid response to the US foreign policy shift toward Ukraine has stimulated EU military unification and rearmament. This is entirely in keeping with the strategies and plans laid out by globalist policy think-tanks. Perhaps random events collide and every decision is nothing more than a reaction, but the weight of evidence thoroughly contradicts mere “coincidence theory.” We are supposed to believe that US isolationism is the pessimistic response to multipolarity while the more positive multilateral approach is closer aligned to the essence of the UN’s Pact for the Future. Either way, both pessimistic isolationism and positive multilateralism seem likely to accelerate multipolar global governance. Despite the different approaches, the geopolitical outcomes are seemingly indivisible. Both portend a regionalised world order bureaucracy and this has always been the planned administrative reorganisation of the planet prior to imposing firm global governance and, ultimately, global government. The Trump administration is blatantly declaring its isolationism. Trump, has publicly withdrawn from the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement, and the US pact with the OECD to work on a Global Tax Deal. He has imposed international trade tariffs and his toughening of US border security is apparently one of the primary reasons he was re-elected. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann has already said Trump’s posturing was interpreted as “concerns raised.” Cormann also said the OECD would “keep working with the U.S. and all countries at the table to support international cooperation that promotes certainty, avoids double taxation, and protects tax bases.” Trump may be haggling for a stronger negotiating position, and we should certainly take his grand statements with a pinch of salt. That said, if we put all this together, what we see is a distinct narrative shift toward polarisation. It is important to stress that we’re witnessing a full-on propaganda offensive. Nevertheless, we are supposed to believe that there are real geopolitical tensions between the EU and the US, not just in relation to Ukraine, but in relation to Greenland. The European Council President António Costa said Denmark had the EU’s “full support” in the Danish government’s alleged confrontation with the US government. Trump has also made aggressive gestures toward BRICS+, warning that tariffs will rain down if the group dumps the USD. Meanwhile, one of he BRICS+ leading nations Russia has said that Trump’s “withdrawal” from the WHO risks “dangerous consequences.” Alexei Kurinney, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Health, said that “from the point of view of protecting exclusively the interests of the United States, this is an isolationist step.” In response to seeming US isolationism, the Chinese government has also criticised the US withdrawals from the WHO and from the Paris Agreement. As we’ve just highlighted, China has offered itself as a reliable global partner to these two entities. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: China is concerned about the US announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. [. . .] Climate change is a common challenge that all of humanity must face. [. . .] The role of the World Health Organization should only be strengthened, not weakened. The stage is clearly set for the final push toward the multipolar world order. But, strange as it may seem, this very push toward multipolarity is bringing the nations closer to a single global political, economic, and (perhaps most notably) financial and monetary “union.” In other words, multipolarity, as it is presented to us, appears to be a monumental psychological operation (psyop). There have been many attempts over the years to form a North American Union (NAU), which would be composed of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. This geopolitical goal received a boost in 1994 with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the plan stalled after receiving strong resistance by the populace of all three countries. On and off, the US government has made numerous attempts to pry Greenland away from Denmark — more often than not citing US defence needs. Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Its inhabitants are therefore citizens of Denmark and, by extension, of the European Union. In 1951, the US and Danish governments signed the Defense of Greenland Treaty, which ostensibly appeased US national security concerns. The US maintains the Pituffik Space Base — formerly known as Thule Air Base — on the island of Greenland. Greenland has never been mentioned with respect to any proposed versions of either a North American Union or a free trade agreement. The prospect of building the Praxis gov-corp Technate on Greenland has evidently reignited enthusiasm. The original American technocrats, however, did include Greenland, along with Caribbean island states and Central American states — as far south as the northernmost territory of South America’s Columbia and Venezuela — in their proposed model of a North American Technate. Prior to this year’s inauguration, Trump outlined his dreams of establishing what can only be described as a plan almost geographically identical to Technocracy Inc.’s original North American Technate. In a series of off-the-wall-sounding statements — not unusual for him — Trump indicated that he wanted to add Greenland, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama to a NAU of Mexico, the US, and Canada. He even threatened the use of force, both economic and military, to construct a geopolitical map that is exactly mirrors the aforementioned North American Technate. There is no realistic prospect, in any geopolitical sense, of this imaginary North American Technate actually being formed. But, as we have already discussed, the Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy portend a kind of geopolitics more reminiscent of the system of city states ruled by the Venetian bankers. The Venetian city state was perhaps the most powerful seasteading project the world has ever known. Trumps seemingly weird ideas about seizing control of Gaza and Greenland, as if they can simply be acquired as sovereign states, and where the sovereignty of the people living there is considered “with derision,” is the epitome of the Dark Enlightenment thinking. Forced displacement of the “unthinking demos” is meaningless if you fervently believe “the system must be first.” The North American Technate map that Trump appeared to deliberately outline first appeared on the cover of the Technocracy Study Course. Yet even the original technocrats didn’t explain how all these nation-states would fall in line with their unhinged ideas. Ironically, the technological advances that have today made the prospect of a Technate feasible have also rendered the concept of a geographical Technate moot. By its nature, global communication technology globalises. The technocrats’ notion of a geographically bounded political Technate has largely been subsumed by the globalist oligarchs’ rollout of global governance architecture and technology. The Club of Rome’s Ten Kingdom model was precisely that: a model. While it is obvious there has been a global effort to make that model a functioning reality, it is clear that the gov-corp Technates under construction will first and foremost be economic and financial administrative zones rather than physical or geopolitical nations as we understand them. The technology used to construct each digital state is common to all. Gov-corp realms may be distinct, with, for example, Amazon dominating its sov-corp realm in the West and the Alibaba-Group dominating its sov-corp realm the East, but the “patchwork of realms” will be global. The decentralisation toward the digital city state is the network enabling centralised control. The formation of regionalised poles looks more like bureaucratic reorganisation in preparation for a simplified global governance administration of realms. Nonetheless, the symbology of Trump’s otherwise bizarre imperial statements seems relatively easy to interpret. Trump and/or his close advisers want to make it clear that Technocracy and the Dark enlightenment are the ideas driving the administration. I suspect Trump will say whatever he is told to say, within reason, on this subject or any other. In my opinion, posturing as a would-be emperor probably appeals to his ego. Personally, I doubt Trump even understands what a gov-corp Technate is, but he may. Whatever the case, the communicated signal could not be made more obvious: The neoreactionary technocrats are in control. Thiel and Musk are not the leading architects of the project to establish the global gov-corp Technate. But they are firm believers and, as made men, have been positioned to lead the US in that direction. Ultimately, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution renders the very concept of the nation-state superfluous. The technocrats and accelerationist neoreactionaries know this. Oligarchs have never had an affinity for one nation more than for any other. The system they seek ignores nation-states completely. If their plan succeeds, the only borders that will still have any relevance to them will be those delineating the “Kingdoms” or “poles” of a much-simplified multipolar global governance structure overseeing a network of realms. Once the mycelium-like global financial network is thriving and once seamless cross-border transactions are instantaneous — enabled by a digital SHC fit for a multipolar world — then geographical political borders will cease to have any economic or monetary meaning. As Peter Thiel observed in a 2001 PayPal all-hands meeting: The ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related. The global system of gov-corp Technates that is emerging represents the most oppressive, totalitarian system of absolute behavioural control ever devised. There will be no need for government policy when entire populations — comprised of millions of individual human beings who were born to think for themselves — can be mentally hijacked and literally programmed by corporate behemoths. But of all the psyops foisted upon us, the greatest among them is the millennia-long propaganda campaign to make us believe we are powerless. This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the “representative democracy” charade. Recognising the staggering audacity of the globalists’ plans and the enormous resources they presently have under their command is not to be “blackpilled.” On the contrary, it is the first step toward liberation. In order to resist the maniacs, we first have to understand what they’re doing and how and why they’re doing it. After that, the only hurdle we must surmount is that of putting all of our own solutions into effect. Our solutions do not have to reimagine the world, we just have to reimagine our tiny portion of it. You don’t need to worry about energy costs if you are energy self sufficient—or as close to it as you can be. You don’t need to be too preoccupied with food prices if you grow it yourself or barter goods and services with those that do, and you don’t need to be overly concerned with exchange rates if you choose your own medium of exchange and trade with other like-minded people in your own community. International financial institutions do not control “money.” Oligarch investors do not control technological development. Governments do not control populations. Only deception, coercion and the use of force ensures these false perceptions. Deception works by bombarding people with propaganda and psyops. Coercion and manipulation are designed to convince us to accept that which we can — and must — decisively reject. Force will almost certainly be used if we do, but there are also eight billion of us. There are better alternatives to top-down oligarch control. Despite the hopes of Musk and Thiel and their ilk, gov-corp Technates are not inevitable. We need only peaceably decline to obey their demented edicts, quit subscribing to their insane schemes, and build something better.

Editor Tech Iain Davis, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout In continuing to unpack the ideologies of the oligarchs who are part of the new Trump administration, Iain Davis examines how their ideas are being translated into policy. He considers the consequent infrastructure rollout that is preparing the US and the world for an imminent Gov-corp Technate within a multipolar world. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the political philosophies that have long been adopted and promoted by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and considered the implications, given both men’s obvious influence on the Trump administration. Musk is a high-profile advocate of Technocracy, and Peter Thiel is an accelerationist neoreactionary who favours, in particular, the Dark Enlightenment. Before you read this article (Part 2), I urge you to familiarise yourself with the explanations of Technocracy and the NRx (the neoreactionary movement) provided in Part 1. Otherwise, many of the references here will lack context. As we noted in Part 1, Thiel and Musk are part of the oligarchic class by virtue of being invited to join a network led by other oligarchs whose stratospheric wealth far surpasses that of the names published on the “richest people in the world” lists. Welcomed into their exclusive club, Thiel and Musk are made men. In Part 2, we will explore how the political philosophies and the associated economic theories of Thiel and Musk are shaping public policy. Keep in mind that these two men are far from alone in attempting to create an American gov-corp Technate. Although they borrow some libertarian ideas, there is nothing truly “libertarian” about either technocrats or accelerationist neoreactionaries. Their convoluted theories, once applied, could not be more authoritarian, more anti-liberty. Just as it is an oxymoron to describe Musk as a “libertarian technocrat,” so is it absurd to think of Peter Thiel as an “anarcho-capitalist.” Yet propagandists persist in encouraging us to see them in these terms. Witness a 2014 article in The Atlantic titled “The Libertarian Capitalist’s Case for State Power and Making No Money.” It is possible that people like Thiel and Musk self-identify as libertarians because they think “liberty” means freedom granted by — and to — the oligarchy. In Part 1, we referenced the Venetian Republic. The Doge of Venice was the ruler of the banking, finance, and commercial empire of the Venetian Republic. That is to say, the Doge was given the liberty to rule by the oligarchs of the day. We might wonder if the naming of the Department of Government Efficiency (the DOGE) that Musk leads deliberately references the Venetian magistrate. Some say it does, while others suggest another possibility. Created as a joke in 2013 by cryptographers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the Dogecoin, a memecoin, has seen its price and market cap soar and fluctuate wildly thanks in no small measure to Elon Musk’s comments about it. Much of Musk’s talk about Dogecoin has been deliberately provocative. For example, in 2019 he declared himself the “former CEO of Dogecoin,” though that was never the case. His social media posts alone have provoked major changes in the price of Dogecoin. Musk has also aggressively hiked its value by, for instance, hinting it might become the basis of the proposed “X pay” payment system on his newly acquired ‘X’ platform — formerly Twitter. Musk encouraged bullish investment in Dogecoin. Of course, just because someone encourages you to do something that doesn’t negate your personal responsibility to conduct due diligence. When some investors lost their shirts, as Dogecoin prices tumbled, they tried to sue Musk in 2022 with a potential $258 billion class action lawsuit. The case was dismissed last year. The judge ruled that Musk’s comments were just “aspirational and puffery, not factual and susceptible to being falsified.” Though it is worth noting the offhand comments of one man took the Dogecoin from a literal joke — a crypto parody — to achieving a market capitalisation of $14.5 billion in 2021. If there is an in-joke to the naming of the DOGE, nominally led by Elon Musk, some argue it is Musk’s fondness for the Dogecoin that is reflected in the D.O.G.E acronym. Yet, the symbolism of “the Doge ”— one who is granted the liberty to rule by oligarchs — is perhaps more conspicuous. Just as with the term “Accelerator” — meaning high-impact investment to accelerate the growth of a startup — an obvious underpinning ideology is implied, even if rarely discussed. In the introduction to his 2012 treatise, “The Dark Enlightenment,” political philosopher Nick Land highlighted the importance of an article written three years earlier by oligarch Thiel. Land wrote: One milestone was the April 2009 discussion hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual forthrightness. Thiel summarized the trend bluntly: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In a related article Thiel penned, titled “The Education of a Libertarian,” he was describing himself, and yet the personal philosophy he outlined in it was pure accelerationist neoreactionism. Thiel opined that “the prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed,” given that the government’s response to every crisis was “more government.” He also claimed that the post-WWI deflationary depression in Western nations was the last “sharp but short” shock to have allowed the alleged advantages of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” to flourish. After that depression, he said, so-called “democratic” politics had stifled the opportunities to capitalise on crises. As a result, Thiel said he no longer believed “that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world.” Asserting, in so many words, that democracies were useless, Thiel announced he had found a new life goal: In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy.” The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. For Thiel, the “unthinking demos” is us: the holders of the “neo-puritan faith” in progressive “social democracy” — the acolytes of the Cathedral (and the people whom Nick Land considers “inarticulate proles”). In Thiel’s view, we must embrace our “technoplastic” future, become intelligible, move beyond politics, and liberate capitalist innovation by swearing fealty to the gov-corp model. To this end, Thiel identified three “technological frontiers” upon which he could construct his darkly enlightened aristocracy.[1] Cyberspace was the first frontier he identified. There, Thiel focused on creating “a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution.” Cyberspace would enable “new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states” — and would result in a new world that would “force change on the existing social and political order.” [2] Outer space would be another Thiel frontier, where the “libertarian future of classic science fiction” could be built. [3] Seasteading would be his interim frontier, where the unclaimed oceans could be settled by humans. He called seasteading “more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel.” Seasteading would at least give us the time to develop the outer-space ideas on earth, prior to colonising the stars. These frontiers are necessary, Thiel insisted, because “we are in a deadly race between politics and technology.” He concluded: We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person [Trump?] who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. [Emphasis added.] Between 2006 and 2012, Thiel was instrumental in organising the Singularity Summits convened by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute — originally the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) — in partnership with Stanford University. Thiel provided much of the funding. Thiel cannot be both an advocate of accelerationist neoreaction and simultaneously an anarcho-capitalist — a libertarian. The two philosophies are mutually exclusive. In Part 1, we noted the technocrats’ rejection of the notion that “all men are created equal.” In a similar vein, Land, Yarvin, Fisher, and other accelerationists consider it essential to have a ruling entity, which can only be comprised of a few human beings exercising an unequal, additional right to rule. Both the technocrats and the accelerationists fundamentally misunderstand, or misinterpret, what the Preamble to The Declaration of Independence means. They completely ignore the second clause of the relevant declaration — namely, “that they [human beings] are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” “Equality,” in real libertarian thinking, does not infer a held belief that everyone is the same — though that is certainly how technocrats interpret the word. Libertarian “equality” doesn’t deny that people have relative strengths and weaknesses. It is not a rejection of either leadership or possible forms of meritocracy. It self-evidently means that every human being has an equal right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” These rights are unalienable — or inalienable. Our rights are not decided for us by others or limited by others, and no one on earth has any more or any fewer “equal rights” than anyone else. This idea is not difficult to grasp. It is central to the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, as clearly enunciated by Murray Rothbard (1926–1995): [N]o man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the person or property of anyone else. Anarcho-capitalism wholeheartedly rejects the initiation of the use of force — the aggressive imposition of claimed authority — by the state to coerce individual persons or seize their property. An example is the threat of fining or imprisoning someone who hasn’t paid taxes to the “proper” authorities. Anarcho-capitalism resoundingly rejects the state and all its dictatorial demands. By contrast, the proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise. Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. The term “technopopulism,” coined by political theorists Christopher Bickerton and Carlo Accetti, has increasingly been bandied about. While the US voters who elected Trump were offered technopopulist promises, this was clearly a sales pitch to entice them to support a gov-corp Technate. “Populism” can be broadly defined as a political attempt to “appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.” “Technocracy” is commonly said to mean “a government or social system that is controlled or influenced by experts in science or technology.” Neither left-wing nor right-wing, technopopulism promises a new kind of politics based on the belief that the more limited role of elected politicians is to put the appropriate teams of experts together to guide policy and to find technological solutions to social and economic problems, thereby benefiting “ordinary people.” But the apparent technopopulist offer to retain democratic accountability in the US is a deceit. The technopopulists say they want to unleash “technocracy” — with a small “t” — for the public good. But the new government system they propose is constructing “Technocracy” — with a big “T” — to serve the interests of the “American elites.” This is evident from The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (aka The 2025 Presidential Transition Project), Promise to America. It claims its purpose is to “defang and defund the woke culture warriors who have infiltrated every last institution in America.” While defanging and defunding woke warriors holds allure for American voters, the Project 2025 methodology actually subverts US “representative democracy.” The Trump administration is evidently closely allied with Project 2025 — denials notwithstanding. One such obvious tie: Trump has nominated Russell Vought to return to the post of director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and, by no coincidence, Vought was a key figure in convening the Project 2025 initiative. Project 2025 contributors were influential in Trump’s first administration and are no less conspicuous in his current picks for office. Project 2025 sets a presidential agenda for the first 180 days in office that seeks to empower the executive branch to meet these key goals: dramatically reduce the size of the public sector bureaucracy; privatise and deregulate the functions of the state; and liberate American technological innovation by “shuttering” it off from the China tech sector’s alleged infiltration. Thus, according to Project 2025, US technology can, if applied properly, be used to resolve all manner of social problems—from anti-American inequality of opportunity in the education system to woke propaganda infesting the media. In other words, American technology produced by Americans and for Americans can supply every long-sought answer to America’s ills. The power of American AI can be set free to, for example, police social media and tackle abuses such as Medicare fraud. Project 2025 offers the additional justification that the US is in an AI arms race with China and, therefore, must invest in AI accordingly. Trump issued a slew of executive orders following his inauguration. These days, this is not an unusual practice for an incoming US president. However, Trump’s EOs were clearly heavily influenced by Project 2025. Ironically, The Heritage Foundation and its Project 2025 are bankrolled by some of the “elites” the project accuses of betraying Americans. The Coors, Koch, Uihlein, Barre Seid, Bradley, and Scaiffe families are among the financial backers of both the Foundation and Project 2025. Rather than technopopulists it is the “TechnoKings” (see Part 1) who have been “assisting” Trumps selection of his administration’s personnel. Musk’s influence is well known but Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, is another influencer. Andreessen has not just been involved in making Trump’s picks for technology and economic related positions — areas where he perhaps has some expertise — but also for US defense and intelligence posts. Andreessen’s Machiavellian reasons for supporting Trump are obvious. As reported by the Verge, in July 2024 Andreessen spelled out that he and his partners were backing Trump, not because they shared any of the concerns voiced by Republican voters, but because they could use the Trump administration to deliver the regulatory environment they wanted for their project to succeed. That project is a gov-corp Technate. Not technopopulism but Techno-Optimism. In 2023, Marc Andreessen published The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. He explained precisely why he and his TechKing partners have seized their opportunity: We can advance to a far superior way of living, and of being. [. . .] We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology. [. . .] We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. [. . .] Combine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the techno-capital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.[. . .] We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to [. . .] ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever. [. . .] We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral, [. . .] as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems. [. . .] We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher’s Stone. [. . .] We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do. This is pure accelerationist neoreaction strongly influence by Technocracy. It is Nick Land and notably not Curtis Yarvin that Andreessen considers among the “Patron Saints” of Techno-Optimism. People like Thiel, Andreessen, and Musk are serious. They want to implement the Dark Enlightenment and are hell-bent on establishing gov-corp Technates. Their oligarch network is indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Currently, the most powerful nation on earth is in their hands. In true technopopulist fashion, it is perhaps Andreessen’s identification of gov-corp enemies that is most revealing: Our enemies are not bad people – but rather bad ideas. Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past – zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now. The eradication of these “enemies” reads like an American voters’ wish-list. Ridding themselves of the globalist’s overreach exercised through institutions like the WHO, the WEF, the UN and even NATO, is what they seemingly voted for. Andreessen attempt to associate ideas like “sustainability,” “stakeholder capitalism” and even “social responsibility” with communism is, at best, wrong, but appears to be disingenuous and mere pandering. This is the Dark Enlightenment’s technopopulist sales pitch. Escaping the grasp of the oligarchs was obviously a vote winner. But the American public has not escaped, on the contrary it has fallen into the clutches of the most authoritarian oligarchs imaginable. Oligarchs who, perhaps for the first time in history, not only have the political authority but the technology to make their gov-corp Technates a reality. This is a clear and present danger to all of us. Not just Americans. The same commitment to accelerationism and creative destruction is evident everywhere. In essence, gov-corp is the ultimate public-private partnership — a kind of inverted fascism where the private stakeholders use the claimed authority and violence of the state to achieve their goals. The construction of Technates is not limited to the US. Arguably China, for example, is already operating a public-private Technocracy. What is happening under our noses is no libertarian dream realized. It is the construction of an all-cognizant, all-controlling, all-consuming global network of gov-corp Technates overseen by a bureaucracy of multiple poles. On the surface, the new brand of technopopulist politics we’ve been examining seems to be anti-Establishment. At least, that’s how it’s being presented. It will use high-tech solutions and AI analysis to, for instance, deliver “lower taxes, much cheaper energy (green and fossil), faster growth and a productivity revolution.” Lest we forget, it will “make America great again” (MAGA). The trouble with this pipe dream, though, is that the ostensible “technopopulists” and avowed neoreactionaries behind it are actually installing Big “T” Technocracy and gov-corp as their solution. Not MAGA, but “Dark MAGA.” In 2020 Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen , and Coinbase established the low tax, low regulation nascent city state called Próspera on the island of Roatán in Honduras. The promotional blurb for Próspera read: Próspera is a startup city with a regulatory system designed for entrepreneurs to build better, cheaper, and faster than anywhere else in the world. The current Honduras government considers Próspera’s claim to enjoy special economic and regulatory status illegal. The previous Honduras administration under Juan Orlando Hernández (JOH) — who was later convicted of drug smuggling in the US — initially created three so-called Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs) of which Próspera is one. The initiative was fiercely opposed by the people of Honduras. The ZEDEs create a “special regime” where investors — Pronomos Capital (Thiel, Andreessen, etc.) — have absolute control of “fiscal, security and conflict resolution policy.” For all intents and purposes, the ZEDEs are startup gov-corps. In 2022, the incoming administration of Xiomara Castro Sarmiento started the process of repealing the ZEDE legislation. This is proving difficult because the Próspera ZEDE framework has a fifty year “built to last” clause in it guaranteeing the project for that period. Gov-corp investors instigated an $11 billion law suit to stop the Honduras government’s attempts to stymie their ambitions. The technocrat oligarchs deployed the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) mechanism against the elected government of Honduras. It is not unreasonable to describe their action as a direct threat to bankrupt the entire nation. As we’ll discuss, these oligarchs are not “nice” people. Whether they call themselves Christian or not. Many of the Próspera trademarks are held by NeWay Capital LLC, founded by Erick Brimen and Trey Goff. NeWay Capital formed the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which is similarly backed by Pronomos Capital — Thiel, Andreessen, Coinbase et al. In 2023, Trump proposed establishing ten so called “Freedom Cities” in the US. The mainstream media focused on his comments about “flying cars,” but he was really talking about embryonic gov-corp Technates. Reportedly, the FCC is now supposedly “in discussion” with the Trump administration to create gov-corp Technates across the US. Trey Goff said “the energy in DC is absolutely electric” and the ambition was to create “not just ten, but as many as the market can handle.” If approved by Congress, these “startup nations” — neoreactionary realms — will be city states like Próspera. The FCC calls these “special districts” Prosperity Zones. The technopopulist offer is to unleash innovation, onshore employment opportunities and revitalise the American economy. The FCC objective is to “accelerate the development of new urban centers.” Freedom Cities will operate in de facto US ZEDEs. The objective is to remove all regulation and allow tech-oligarchs the freedom to do whatever they like. These will be cities without limits, say the FCC and will be “zones of regulatory clarity and economic dynamism, [. . .] allowing entrepreneurs and builders to move at the speed of human ingenuity.” The accelerationist neoreactionaries and the technocrats are racing ahead. As evidenced by Andreessen’s Techno-Optimist Manifesto, there is no doubt what they have in mind. In 2022, Balaji Srinivasan — former Andreessen Horowitz general partner and former chief technology officer for Coinbase — published his book The Network State: How to Start a New Country. In it, he outlined the neoreactionary strategy to “escape politics in all its forms” and enable tech-billionaire oligarchs to form their own sovereign states—sov-corps. There is nothing pro-American about the NRx’s collective vision. Srinivasan wants the proposed “startup nations” to secede from the US and considers the US outdated and obsolescent. Shortly we’ll discuss Trump’s peculiar and seemingly unilateral declaration that his administration is intent upon grabbing Greenland — and Gaza apparently. We are supposed to believe that it is Trump who wants Greenland (and perhaps Gaza); that Trump is the great strategist playing some sort of 5D geopolitical chess game. But it is Peter Thiel and his oligarch network that wants to build a gov-corp Technate called Praxis on Greenland. The people of Greenland should be wary. There is no legal limit to the “built to last” territorial expansion of Próspera and the TechnoKing oligarchs have the backing of the World Bank to make sure their project does last. Following Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times published an adversarial interview with aforementioned political theorist of the neoreactionary movement (NRx) Curtis Yarvin. Outlining Yarvin’s contention that the US should be run as a corporate monarchy (gov-corp) under the leadership of an all-powerful CEO (Trump), Times‘ writer and interviewer David Marchese formulated his arguments on the suspected racist aspects of Yarvin’s ideology. The pair debated nothing of notable interest. The piece allowed Yarvin to forward some of his ideas to a wider public — but without disclosing any of their appalling implications. Meanwhile, the Times‘ Marchese posited a practically irrelevant counterargument. The legacy media is not going to point out those appalling implications. But this is what Yarvin, the leader of the NRx admired by Peter Thiel and other neoreactionary oligarchs, had proposed in 2008 under his pen name, Mencius Moldburg: Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma. The best humane alternative to genocide I can think of is not to liquidate the wards [people]—either metaphorically or literally—but to virtualize them. A virtualized human is in permanent solitary confinement, waxed like a bee larva into a cell which is sealed except for emergencies. This would drive him insane, except that the cell contains an immersive virtual-reality interface which allows him to experience a rich, fulfilling life in a completely imaginary world. The suspected racist streak in Yarvin does matter when we consider the implications of his gov-corp philosophy. But to imagine that identity politics provides any kind of intellectual basis to tackle the NRx dooms all such opposition to failure. If the objective is to resist accelerationist neoreaction, then harping on about the divisions between the progressive left and the right-wing — or “alt-right” — serves no useful purpose. Such arguments don’t even come close to comprehending what the Dark Enlightenment is. They only deflect the public from paying vital attention to real threats. The Dark Enlightenment is not racist. It is anti-human race. Its advocates do not care what colour gov-corp’s customers are. They seek, rather, to transform all of humanity, to bring an end to what it is to be a sovereign human being. Musk has already stated his desire to transform his X platform into a payment service provider and finance portal that, he hopes, could become “half of the world’s financial system.” Thanks in part to the headway made by Facebook’s Libra (Diem) project — more in this shortly — in 2023, Musk was able to start applying for the necessary regulatory approval for his financial domination project. Via its “Digital State” — again, we’ll cover this in a moment — Ukrainians are the Digital State’s “customers.” Musk wants to X to form the basis of a worldwide Digital State in which all users will be customers. Citizens as customers of government services is a key component of the gov-corp structure that neoreactionaries like Thiel and Andreessen desire. Just as we see the rise of the accompanying “accelerators” everywhere, so to the description of us as “customers” is seeping into the lexicon of governments the world over. In 2019, the US multinational corporation IBM, whose operations make it the largest industrial research organization in the world and whose chequered history includes assisting the Nazis to perpetrate a holocaust, explained why we all need to consider ourselves the customers of our governments: Today’s society is changing at a record pace as companies worldwide develop innovative solutions designed to make the world a more efficient and sustainable place. [. . .] Apps provide us with personalized information based on geolocation; we can shop online from the comfort of our couch, and organize our finances on our smartphones.[. . .] [I]t’s time to rethink and reinvent public sector services, [. . .] a digital reinvention helps build trust in the public sector as a brand: the government has your back. [. . .] At IBM, we’re there to guide you through the current age of digital reinvention. IBM, alongside CIA-linked Oracle, is a partner of the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and is assisting it to “accelerate transformation” to a new digital DWP service. For its part, as it proceeds to make a £6 billion cut, the UK DWP has stopped winter fuel payments to pensioners and has committed to freezing and restricting access to disability payments to the disabled. It is effectively lowering unemployment benefits for the sick and disabled and tightening the eligibility criteria for nearly all state benefits. At the same time, the UK government is pushing through the Terminally-ill Adults (End of Life) Bill — commonly referred to as the Assisted Dying Bill — to make it easier for the state to kill people who just can’t take it any more. All of this, according to the DWP, is part of its drive to provide a better “customer experience.” In 2021, The Biden administration issued Executive Order 14058 to improve the US federal government’s customer’s experience. Consequently, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS): [. . .] every person who pays taxes or uses Medicare is a customer of the federal government. Every veteran who uses a VA facility is a customer, every government employee that fills out their timesheet is a customer. The “customer experience” is how people experience and perceive our government services. It is what happens at the touchpoints when someone interacts with a government service. The customer experience can be a single touchpoint or several over a longer relationship between the “customer” and government. Each touchpoint is an opportunity for a positive interaction that adds up to a positive customer experience. The mainstream media is avidly pushing the idea that politicians like Trump are in charge. But, not only does EO 14058 illustrate the clear shift towards NRx gov-corp aligned thinking, it also shows that the transformation is not dependent on whatever administration happens to be in office at the time. Gov-corp represents the underlying philosophy driving this governance reinvention. Technocracy is the operating system for the impending Technates, regardless of who you vote for. The shift to digital money and “digital states” is key to the reimagining of society. Rather like the WeChat “everything app” in China, which operates as a public-private partnership between the government and Tencent — enabling the technocratic state to directly influence an estimated 1.3 billion Chinese customers –– the size of the X user-base gives Musk’s network an opportunity to construct his version of an everything app digital state. With an estimated 600 million users, Musk’s team is ready to launch his platform’s X-money payment system. It seems Musk doesn’t anticipate any regulatory problems, as another building block of the X-digital state is dropped into place. As X moves toward becoming a “comprehensive financial services hub,” working in partnership with Visa, the plan is to reportedly integrate digital currencies into the X-money system by the end of the year. The new interoperable global monetary system that is emerging has been designed to perpetuate the same old monetary game with the added benefit of AI surveillance and behavioural control. Investors can speculate — engaging in creative destruction — while protecting their digital finance empires by storing value in new digital reserve assets, almost certainly bitcoin. A so-called Synthetic Hegemonic Currency can and is being created, primarily using USD-denominated stablecoins underwritten by US debt. In contrast to the investor experience, it is unlikely to benefit many of its customers. Contemplating new methods of genocide to rid yourself of whomever you find “undesirable” is something we associate with tyrannical megalomaniacs not egalitarian democratic “leaders.” Unfortunately, certainly in the US, it seems the maniac tyrants have the upper hand. As many Unlimited Hangout readers already know, Thiel received investment funds from the CIA’s In-Q-Tel to accelerate Palantir. Part of that arrangement was for Palantir to establish a public-private partnership that would rescue a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Total Information Awareness (renamed the Terrorism-IA program in 2003). The purpose of the TIA was to create an all-pervasive US surveillance and population control system, with a heavy focus on pre-crime and other “predictive” interventions that would allow the state to justify any policy it chooses. The TIA project faltered when the US public learned of its intentions. State funding was officially withdrawn — which simply meant that the “less controversial” aspects continued under the guise of combating terrorism while the controversial projects went darker still. Ever since 9/11, “terrorism” has been the convenient PR buzz word for covering up a multitude of illegalities. The TIA program continued, unabated, to spy on the entire US population as a public-private partnership. Shortly after incorporating Palantir in 2003, Thiel and Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp reportedly met with the TIA’s chief architect, John Poindexter. The pair apparently impressed upon Poindexter that they shared his vision of a US domestic digital gulag. Yet, unlike TIA, which had been housed at the Pentagon’s DARPA, they would develop the TIA system as a private entity. According to New York magazine, Thiel and Karp convinced Poindexter that Palantir would “pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies — everything from human intelligence and cell-phone calls to travel records and financial transactions.” Evidently, In-Q-Tel’s seed funding followed soon thereafter. The CIA remained Palantir’s sole client until 2008. That is to say, Palantir enjoyed a monopoly due to its partnership with the state. Although Thiel’s cadre at PayPal — often called the PayPal Mafia — is supposedly responsible for ousting Musk from the company’s CEO spot, the rift between the two men seems somewhat overstated. Just as it is clear Musk hankers to install Technocracy, Thiel’s passion for the Dark Enlightenment is equally unambiguous. Both ideologies are mutually reinforcing. While there are some apparent tensions between Musk and Thiel, they are on the same path. Yarvin, for one, certainly values Musk’s contribution. Thiel and Musk are already megarich magnates on the order of the robber barons of old. As such, their respective Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy dreams, when realized, are intended to make them “sovereigns” of what Yarvin calls a “patchwork of realms.” The shared view of technocrats and neoreactionaries that society would be better if it were ruled by the likes of Musk and Thiel is an absurd and dangerous folly. We shouldn’t labour under any illusions that they’re nice. Anduril Industries CEO Palmer Lucky is another Thiel protégé who, having sold his Oculus VR headset business to Mark Zuckerberg, moved into the war business with the help of Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund. Through Anduril, Thiel is investing in a defence technology that maximises AI’s ability to kill. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk have both been instrumental in the development of AI. They combined forces in 2015 to accelerate Thiel protégé Sam Altman’s OpenAI as a “non-profit” research company. Today, propelled by the success of its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, OpenAI is valued at around $160 billion. Consequently, its “for profit” subsidiary, OpenAI Global LLC, is poised to make fantastic profits. OpenAI was pitched as a tool for developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole.” Presumably, OpenAI’s defence contracts and its participation in the Silicon Valley consortium bid to dominate the US military-industrial complex reflect this principled commitment. Or perhaps the ethical stance of the team behind OpenAI is about as plausible as their “non-profit” pretensions. There is every reason not to trust hypocrites like Thiel and Musk. One of those reasons is Palantir’s encroachment into national health-data systems, which is creating a virtual healthcare data monopoly in some countries — including the UK. This is extremely concerning, because it is obvious that patient care — or even basic human compassion — is not a priority for Thiel’s Palantir. There is nothing “Christian” about Thiel’s conduct. On the contrary, Palantir has actively participated in Israel’s Palestinian genocide and in the almost-complete destruction of the Palestinians’ healthcare system. In January 2024, Thiel and Palantir CEO Alex Karp agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and signed a deal with the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) to “harness Palantir’s advanced technology in support of war-related missions.” Of this deal the British Medical Journal observed: IOF operations have been described as a “war on hospitals” because of the systematic destruction of Gaza’s entire health system and 943 IOF attacks on healthcare. Hundreds of health workers have been detained, tortured, and killed. In addition to directly attacking healthcare, ongoing bombardment, forced displacement of Palestinians, and near complete siege of Gaza, the IOF has created a severe health and humanitarian crisis with high rates of malnutrition, infectious disease, famine, and dehydration. Several Thiel-backed companies — Palantir (seed-funded by In-Q-Tel),Anduril and digital surveillance company Clearview AI — have all evidently used the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a test bed for their technology. As noted by Stavroula Pabst in her Unlimited Hangout article, “How Peter Thiel-Linked Tech is Fueling the Ukraine War,” these companies are “taking advantage of the conflict to develop controversial AI-driven weapons systems and facial recognition technologies, perhaps transforming both warfare and AI forever.” Despite Thiel’s self-described libertarian and Christian beliefs, Pabst noted that the net impact of his venture capitalism couldn’t be more inhuman: [T]hese Thiel-backed groups’ involvement in war serves to develop not only problematic and unpredictable weapons technologies and systems, but also apparently to advance and further interconnect a larger surveillance apparatus formed by Thiel and his elite allies’ collective efforts across the public and private sectors, which arguably amount to the entrenchment of a growing technocratic panopticon aimed at capturing public and private life. Within the context of Thiel’s growing domination over large swaths of the tech industry, apparent efforts to influence, bypass or otherwise undermine modern policymaking processes, and anti-democratic sentiments, Thiel-linked organizations’ activities in Ukraine can only signal a willingness to shape the course of current events and the affairs of sovereign nations alike. Though Pabst’s piece was written in October 2023, her prescient observations have certainly been playing out. As we embark on 2025, it is clear that Thiel and Musk are among a troop of tech titans who have ingratiated themselves with the Trump administration. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. On their own, the ideologies of communitarianism, stakeholder capitalism, Technocracy, the Dark Enlightenment, and any other political ideology amount to little more than academic musings. Once implemented through the power and authority illegitimately claimed by the state, however, they couldn’t be more significant. Thiel has heavily backed current Vice President JD Vance and other Republican political candidates, such as Blake Masters, who co-authored Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How to Build the Future with Thiel in 2014. There is a nexus of Thiel protégés surrounding the new Trump administration. It is hard to see how Vance could rise to what some call the second-most-powerful position in the US were it not for the career-long support he has received from Thiel. As Thiel’s man, Vance’s admiration for the Dark Enlightenment is transparent. Adopting Yarvin’s “Retire All Government Employee” (RAGE) motto, which now seems to be embodied by the DOGE, Vance suggested that a future Trump administrator should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, [and] replace them with our people.” In 2017, Buzzfeed published extracts from the dump of an email exchange between Curtis Yarvin and Milo Yiannopoulis. In one email, Yarvin revealed that he had watched the 2016 US election results with Thiel and said that Thiel was “fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.” In his 2021 book, The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power, Bloomberg Technology writer Max Chafkin describes Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” of the “Thielverse,” according to a July 2024 article by Gil Duran in The New Republic. Of course, Thiel does not want it widely known that he supports the Dark Enlightenment of the NRx. With its aim to destroy the political realm and replace it with a corporate monarchy, the Dark Enlightenment, if fully understood by the public, would outrage them and would be, for Thiel, a PR disaster. Despite the potential for that to happen, Yarvin’s ideas continue to influence him. One such crazy notion was revealed by Yarvin in his talk at the March 2012 BIL Conference (an alternative to TED). Speaking as Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin advocated for gov-corp: There is no difference between a CEO and a dictator. If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia. Just a few weeks later, Thiel gave a lecture at Stanford, where he said: A startup is basically structured as a monarchy. We don’t call it that, of course. That would seem weirdly outdated, and anything that’s not democracy makes people uncomfortable. We are biased toward the democratic-republican side of the spectrum. That’s what we’re used to from civics classes. But the truth is that startups and founders lean toward the dictatorial side because that structure works better for startups. Ten days prior to Trump’s inauguration, Thiel used the Financial Times as an outlet to pontificate about the second-term President’s second-time promises to disclose details of the Kennedy assassination plot and to protect free speech, etc. Time will tell if these promises are kept. In the same article, Thiel laid bare the lineage of his own philosophy: Darker questions still emerge in these dusky final weeks of our interregnum. [. . .] The future demands fresh and strange ideas. New ideas might have saved the old regime, which barely acknowledged, let alone answered, our deepest questions — the causes of the 50-year slowdown in scientific and technological progress. Certainly from 2009 onward, Thiel has viewed politics as a vehicle to promote his accelerationist NRx-aligned objectives. Not because he particularly shares the values of any political party, either Democrat or Republican — or, for that matter, Libertarian — but because he recognises that people are programmed to feel comfortable as long as they believe whatever they support has something to do with “democracy.” Remember, Thiel calls us the “unthinking demos.” In 2014, reporting the evidence of some of the other links between Yarvin and Thiel, Corey Pein, writing for The Baffler, accurately lumped Thiel in with the NRx and called them collectively a bunch of “mouthbreathing Machiavellis.” Responding to Pein’s piece, Thiel said, according to an article published shortly thereafter in The New York Times: Actually, I found that vaguely flattering. [. . .] It was the full-on conspiracy theory. In truth, there’s nobody sitting around plotting the future, though sometimes I think it would be better if people were. This was blatant baloney. Thiel well knows there are people “sitting around plotting the future.” He himself maintains a web of connections with the plotters of which he speaks — and is obviously one of them. Thiel, as President of Thiel Capital, sits on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. The steering committee sets the agenda for the secretive Bilderberg Meetings where around 130 selected globalist delegates debate policy initiatives behind closed doors. Palantir CEO, Thiel’s associate Alex Karp, is also on the steering committee, as is former chair and CEO of Google Eric Schmidt and the President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Børge Brende. Consequently, it isn’t surprising that the main topic for debate at the last 2024 Bilderberg meeting was Artificial Intelligence (AI). Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been selected as the chair for the next Bilderberg Meeting and will also serve as chair of the next Munich Security Conference (MSC). The UK Guardian reports that his appointment marks a moment where the “influential” Bilderberg group is contributing toward the “concentration of control at the top of the Atlantic alliance.” Noting that Bilderberg brings together “prime ministers, EU commissioners, bank bosses, corporate CEOs and intelligence chiefs,” it was ridiculous for Thiel — a senior Bilderberger — to feign ignorance of those who evidently are “plotting the future.” Yarvin, in the earlier-referenced interview with David Marchese in The New York Times, was asked what he meant when he said Thiel was “fully enlightened”: Fully enlightened for me means fully disenchanted. [. . .] It’s a disenchantment from believing in these old systems. And the thing that should replace that disenchantment is not, Oh, we need to do things Curtis’s [or Peter’s] way. It’s basically just a greater openness of mind. Sure, the Dark Enlightenment rejects the “old systems” — i.e., representative democracy — but Yarvin’s diplomatic response cannot hide the fact that Thiel and other members of the NRx evidently know what they want to replace it with: gov-corp overseeing a network of sovcorp-managed functional sequences in a Technate instead of within existing nation-states. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. Obviously, any sane person would welcome the end of hostilities, but there is a clear subtext to the US policy shift. The Trump administration has emphasised the US potential deal with Ukraine to access Ukraine’s possible rare earth metal deposits as a “win” for US voters. He told the US public that there were “$500B worth of rare earth” in Ukraine. This is highly speculative. While Ukraine certainly has a lot of coal, oil, gas and uranium, much if that is in territory currently occupied by the Russian Federation. The estimates of rare earth metal deposits in extant Ukrainian territory were made around half a century ago and some, such as independent energy and mining consultant Tony Mariano, have significant doubts about the commercial viability or even the presence of the alleged deposits: As far as I know, there are no economically viable rare earth deposits in Ukraine. I have evaluated clay deposits that I thought had potential, but I found that they are not viable. This does not mean that there are none, but that more exploration and evaluation is needed. With regard to the minerals deposits that are known to exist in Russia’s “new territories,” including any possible if unlikely rare-earth deposits, Russian president Vladimir Putin has indicated his willingness to collaborate with the US again. In the spirit of public-private partnership (stakeholder capitalism), Putin told journalist Pavel Zarubin that Russia was ready “to offer [cooperation] to our American partners – when I say partners, I mean not only administrative and government structures, but also companies.” While Russians and Ukrainians continued to die, Kirill Dmitriev, former Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and WEF investment guru, and the current CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund — appointed in 2023 by Putin as special representative of the Russian president for investment — said that US energy corporations would welcome “access to Russian natural resources.” In 2014, the US enabled and supported Ukrainian Nazis (the Right Sector and others) to orchestrate the violent Euromaidan Coup that overthrew the elected president Victor Yanukovich. Ukrainian Nazi atrocities in Odessa and Mariupol immediately followed and marked the start of an eight-year-long war that Russian forces officially entered in 2022. From the moment Russia began its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, the US response was focused on seizing economic, financial and resource control of Ukraine in exchange for bolstering its military. It is not unreasonable to observe that Russian intervention enabled the US public-private partnership to capture Ukraine. With the Russian government now looking forward to working with its US partners, and given that the US state was instrumental in instigating the current conflict, one has to wonder what this war has really been about. Large US corporations, such as Microsoft and Amazon, began the process of digitising the Ukrainian government on February 24th 2022, the day Russia is said to have “invaded” Ukraine. This process has since seen Ukraine become a world leader in “digital democracy.” Ukrainian citizens are being coerced towards accepting digital ID, digital payments and into total reliance on digital infrastructure for many of their everyday needs. This has been met with great enthusiasm from globalist think tanks, such as The Centre for International Governance Innovation. As Ukrainian energy and technological infrastructure became more reliant on US corporations, global investors — through the asset management giant BlackRock — agreed to deals with the Ukrainian government to “structure the nation’s reconstruction funds.” In November 2022 BlackRock announced: BlackRock FMA [Financial Markets Advisory] will advise the MoE [Ukraine Ministry of Economy] on establishing a roadmap for the investment framework’s implementation, including identifying design choices for the envisioned setup, structure, mandate and governance. The MoU [Memorandum of Understanding] formalizes the discussions the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, held in September on the possibilities of driving public and private investments into Ukraine. The WEF arranged further meetings between Zelensky’s administration and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon alongside a consortium of investors represented by executives from BlackRock, Bridgewater Associates, Carlyle Group, Blackstone, Dell, ArcelorMittal, and others. With the financial architecture in place, and US and other multinational corporations set to capitalise, the emphasis shifted in early 2024 towards reducing the investment risk. War is the preferred business model for private military contractors (PMCs – mercenaries), or International Defense Companies (IDCs) as they are called in Ukraine. With Ukrainian government legislation in the pipeline to legalise IDCs operating in post-war Ukraine — coinciding with the Pentagon’s decision to ease restrictions supposedly placed on US PMCs (IDCs) working in Ukraine — US PMCs are just one corner of the US military industrial complex set to exploit the thirty-five-fold increase in the Ukrainian defence market created by Russia’s “invasion.” This is yet another tantalising Ukraine war opportunity for multinational financiers, such as BlackRock’s investors for example. Obviously, a “post-war” Ukraine is needed to turn these investment opportunities into solid ventures. With the US public-private stakeholder invasion of Ukraine complete, and the Russian public-private stakeholders ready to do business, Ukraine finds itself in a precarious position. It is almost completely in the hands of US corporations. For example, Ukraine is now heavily reliant on Musk’s Starlink for its internet connectivity and other communication systems. Indeed Ukraine’s “digital democracy” is now largely controlled by oligarchs like Musk. The Ukrainian Diia app is the product of a joint project between the CIA front organisation USAID and the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation which named Diia the literal Digital State. Diia is an “everything app.” It ties Ukrainian citizens to a centralised digital control system (Diia) through which they access government services. Their digital IDs and digital passports, driving licenses, fine levies and payments, their tax returns, tax accounts, their mRNA vaccine certificates and more can all be overseen by the Digital State. Of course, the overwhelming priority is to end the war. From a humanitarian perspective, at this point, nothing could be more important. Trump will almost certainly be credited if his apparent diplomacy succeeds and this will surely be perceived as more evidence of his great leadership by his supporters. We are supposed to believe that the Ukraine government’s stalling over Trump’s deal for US corporations’ access to Ukrainian rare earth deposits is the reason why the US has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s Starlink connectivity. The privatisation of a state like Ukraine couldn’t be more dangerous for its people. Musk was quick to point out that he could personally end Ukraine’s war effort, claiming the Ukrainian military’s “entire front line would collapse if I turned it off.” He later added this is something he would not do. Though obviously, given the Dogecoin debacle, Musk’s team fully comprehend the impact his comments have. In truth, there is a vast network of international investors looking at a post-war Ukraine with avarice. The rare earth deal is a sideshow to keep the public bemused. The whole nation state of Ukraine is ripe for the picking and the transition to a US satellite gov-corp Technate is already well underway. As previously noted, one of Peter Thiel’s long-term ambitions has been to create “a new world currency.” Fortuitously, one of Trump’s first executive orders was aimed at strengthening US leadership in digital financial technology. In it, he promised his voter base that he would prohibit “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] within the jurisdiction of the United States.” But there is a caveat: The order “shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.” As we know, legislative “laws” are subject to change at any time. Trump included in this EO a US government commitment to promote and protect “the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” [Emphasis added.] As extensively reported in the four-part investigative series on the cryptocurrency industry published last November by Unlimited Hangout writers Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin, rather than averting the societal risks associated with CBDC, Trump’s January 23rd executive order arguably portends something far worse. As Webb and Goodwin pointed out: [T]he policy of the Federal Reserve since last year has made it clear that they favor “private stablecoin issuance rather than official CBDC issuance.” With stablecoins being just as programmable and surveillable as CBDCs, and some stablecoin issuers like Tether already allied with U.S. intelligence and security agencies, the current stablecoin bill is poised to pave the way for the U.S.’ de facto CBDC and to ensure that Wall Street and well-established titans of digital finance like PayPal have the advantage. In particular, Thiel, PayPal, Facebook (now Meta), and US financial regulators have, for some time, been preparing for “a new world currency.” In order to understand the process they have been setting up, we first need to consider how this public-private partnership has apparently shaped the financial regulatory framework in the US. Thiel emphasised the “new world currency” idea in his aforementioned 2009 article, “The Education of a Libertarian” (the piece, you may remember, that influenced Nick Land’s conceptualisation of the Dark Enlightenment). In that piece, he wrote: [T]he founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. Peter Thiel sat on the Meta (Facebook) board of directors until 2022, when he left to reportedly “focus on political endeavours.” Upon his departure, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his personal gratitude to Thiel for “teaching me so many lessons about business, economics, and the world.” In 2019, under Thiel’s evident influence, Facebook announced its intention to launch a stablecoin payment system called Libra, which it soon renamed Diem. The project was co-headed by David A. Marcus, who moved to Facebook from PayPal in 2014, and by Morgan Beller, who migrated from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Libra appears to have failed. But, as Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin explain, that interpretation depends upon what one views the purpose of Libra (Diem) to have actually been. With an estimated two billion-plus Facebook users worldwide, if Libra had succeeded, it would have represented the potential “end of monetary sovereignty” as far as central banks were concerned. Apparently, the mere announcement of Libra’s proposition sent financial regulators into an tailspin. The unregulated issuance of “money” couldn’t be allowed to happen! Hence, Zuckerberg had to be seen being quizzed by pretty much the entire global financial and political “elite.” In May 2019, Thiel protégé Sam Altman wrote a blog post in which he said: Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner — let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency — and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency. I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency. In August 2019, at the G7 central bankers symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the main topic of discussion was what the Bank of England’s then-Governor Mark Carney called a growing “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS” [International Monetary and Financial System]. Carney told the gathered bankers and financiers that the “world economy was being reordered.” He said that the US dollar remained “important” in the short term but that “the game” must change to suit a “multipolar world.” Therefore, “the global reserve currency”—the US dollar (USD) — needed to transform into some sort of “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” (SHC). Carney added: While the likelihood of a multipolar IMFS might seem distant at present, technological developments provide the potential for such a world to emerge. Such a platform would be based on the virtual rather than the physical. [. . .] Technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency [the USD] from being displaced. [. . .] The most high-profile of these has been Libra—a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro, and sterling. [. . .] The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear [. . .] the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch. As a consequence, it is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies. [. . .] Even if the initial variants of the idea prove wanting, the concept is intriguing. It is worth considering how an SHC in the IMFS could support better global outcomes, given the scale of the challenges of the current IMFS and the risks in transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi. So, here is Carney saying that the Libra stablecoin raised the “intriguing” possibility of creating a new SHC “backed by reserve assets” but that Libra itself was “wanting” due to the lack of clear “terms of engagement.” However, if the requisite regulatory “terms of engagement” were “in force well in advance of any launch,” Carney raised the potential to create an SHC using Libra-like stablecoins. This, he proposed, could stave off challenges from new possible hegemonic reserve currency alternatives, such as China’s Renminbi, and create a USD SHC suitable for a “multipolar IMFS.” A month after Jackson Hole, in September 2019, Zuckerberg met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss “future internet regulation.” He was also invited to the White House for a “surprise” meeting. Then, in October, Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the aforementioned Libra (Diem) and was invited again to the White House — this time for dinner and this time accompanied by then Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The Trump administration didn’t think it necessary to disclose what was discussed, according to an NBC News report. Immediately thereafter, Zuckerberg’s Libra project began to shift away from a stablecoin based on “a basket of currencies,” and by 2020 it was more closely aligned with the USD. The Financial Times reported in late November 2021 that Libra would initially launch as “a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar.” Webb and Goodwin speculate, with good reason, that the whole point of Facebook’s purportedly aggressive pursuit of Libra (Diem) was not so much about the stablecoin itself but rather about creating a threat that would appear to warrant regulatory change. It appears the team behind Libra always anticipated the failure of Libra and the resultant formation of a regulatory framework for a potential USD Synthetic Hegemonic Currency. Going back to July 2019, two months before the Jackson Hole symposium, Facebook stated in an SEC filing: Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. [. . .] These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency. [. . .] As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. The fact that Facebook (now Meta) knew Libra might fail and was counting on new regulations that would open new digital financial markets could cause careful observers to conclude that Zuckerberg’s Libra project was intended to be an embodiment of “creative destruction.” While the Libra (Diem) stablecoin didn’t make it, the stablecoin market as a whole has done quite well, if one measures by market capitalization. The leading stablecoins are Tether’s USDT ($140 billion), Circle’s USDC ($44 billion), and the Ethereum blockchain-based “decentralised” DAI ($3 billion). Then we have FD121 Ltd.’s FDUSD ($1.8 billion) and USDD ($750 million), initially issued on the TRON blockchain. PayPal stablecoin PYUSD, issued by the Paxos Trust Company and currently at $480 million market cap, stands apart because Paxos is a fully regulated US custodian. What’s more, PYUSD is perhaps the most firmly 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, backed as it is with a mix of USD deposits, short-term US Treasurys, and cash equivalents. When the Nixon administration closed the gold window in 1971, ending the monetary system formulated at Bretton Woods in 1944, the USD became fully disassociated from any real intrinsic value (gold), though fractional reserve banking had already practically relinquished the dollar-and-gold association. The subsequent fiat currency monetary system has led to an enormous expansion of the money supply and ballooning of global debt. Those inevitabilities ultimately caused what Carney described as the “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS.” Carney recognised that the world’s leading holders of US debt were Japan and China. Both countries have been accelerating the process of dumping US Treasury securities (government bonds). Their bond market moves further threaten the dominance of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Now Trump has come to the White House with a fiscal policy package promising low domestic taxes and higher international trade tariffs at the very time that his country’s “exorbitant privilege” — the US economic advantage gained by funding its own deficit by issuing the reserve currency every other nation needs to buy — is receding. US public spending is fuelled by borrowing — by issuing government bonds. The traditional monetary view would suggest that the only option available to the US is to massively inflate the money supply — again! But, with its staggering $36 trillion national debt, and with other national governments increasingly unwilling to buy that debt (creating a lower demand), US borrowing costs seem set to rise and exacerbate the mounting debt problem. Bluntly put, the US dollar and the US economy would appear to be screwed. Unless, of course, the US can find some other outlet to absorb its debt. If it can, there’s no reason why the monetary Ponzi scheme can’t carry on. Obviously, it will continue to have a terrible impact on people around the world, especially the poorest — including the poorest Americans. But when have rapacious oligarchs ever cared about social deprivation? The total supply of stablecoins has now eclipsed $200 billion. In the US, Tether is currently the third-largest buyer of US 3-month Treasuries and the 16th-largest purchaser of US government bonds globally. Because they absorb US debt, stablecoins are seen as the key to stabilising US interest rates. The proposed Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has led some to suggest that it might become a regulatory requirement for USD-denominated digital tokens (stablecoins) to back their coins with nothing but US Treasury bills. If so, under Paxos’ custody, PYUSD is already well-placed to take advantage. The bitcoin (BTC) hard cap, embedded in its code, ensures that no more that 21 million BTC can ever be “mined” (that is, issued). Every four years “halving” occurs, thereby theoretically reducing bitcoin issuance. This is the polar opposite of the fiat monetary system, in which the money supply can, realistically, only expand. The resulting inflation persistently devalues fiat currency. Bitcoin, however, is inherently deflationary. It is a tempting store of value for oligarchs who have treated the fiat currency system as if it were their own fiefdom to control and have run it into the ground. Currently the top 21 holders of bitcoin collectively possess 2.3 million BTC, representing around 11% of the total bitcoin supply. At today’s prices, that is the equivalent of $236 billion in BTC holdings. The presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, author (or authors) of the original bitcoin white paper and possessor of perhaps as much as 1.1 million BTC, is officially the 19th wealthiest individual on the planet, worth around $91 billion. He may not be an individual but a collection of bitcoin founders. Some believe the name was made up by intelligence officials who could be behind the creation of bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which provides business intelligence and mobile software services and whose leading shareholders are Capital Group, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock, is the second-largest holder of bitcoin after Nakamoto. The third largest are the combined governments of the US and the UK, which reportedly hold $19 billion and $6 billion of bitcoin, respectively. Block.one — backed by Thiel — is the fourth largest, with more than $15 billion. The fifth-largest holder is Tether, owner of the USDT stablecoin, which has $8 billion and is the world’s largest trader of cryptocurrency. Tether has committed to investing 15% of its annual profits in bitcoin. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, grilled last March by Yahoo Finance, called BTC “the most valuable asset in the world” and “the endgame for anybody that wants to own the greatest property in the 21st century.” And, according to a blurb last October by Forbes senior contributor Billy Bambrough, who has the magazine’s bitcoin and blockchain beat, “Saylor has revealed [MicroStrategy’s] endgame [. . .] to become a bitcoin investment bank—and to buy up to $150 billion of bitcoin.” MicroStrategy investors are presumably eager to see that bid succeed. They’re aware, as is Saylor, that being bullish on bitcoin further stimulates demand for BTC and brings “the endgame” closer. BlackRock apparently agrees. The multinational investment company has seen its global asset portfolio increase to approximately $11 trillion, thanks in no small measure to its pivot toward digital currencies. Hitherto cool on cryptocurrencies, as other large investment houses have been, BlackRock now considers bitcoin in particular to be a digital asset. “We believe,” said CEO Larry Fink last October, that “bitcoin is [an] asset class in itself, an alternative to other commodities like gold.” Also, BlackRock is now among those advocating digitizing the dollar. Trump’s executive order establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has tasked that group with developing “a Federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, including stablecoins, and evaluating the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile.” Simultaneously, the trajectory toward setting bitcoin as the “new gold alternative” is well underway. Notably, the Swiss government has already started the formal process of amending Article 99 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to allow the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold BTC reserves. “On-ramps” are payment services that allow users to exchange fiat currency for digital assets like stablecoins. “Off-ramp” services allow users to convert digital assets back into fiat currencies. Using stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to the USD, greatly simplifies the process if you want dollars. That said, in a “multipolar IMFS,” Chinese and Japanese customers, for example, might not want USDs. Advances in decentralized finance technology (DeFi) are homogenizing global currencies. An effective SHC, with the USD set to dominate, is rapidly approaching. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates cross-border payment in USDC. This is fine if you want to off-ramp into fiat USDs, but if you want Euros, you still need to deal with the USD-Euro exchange rate (market price). This additional exchange reduces speed and increases the cost of the transaction (gas fees), thereby limiting scalability to non-USD customers. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, make use of Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi. This better enables cross-border transactions between stablecoins backed by different fiat currencies. Cross-chain interoperability protocols facilitate communication and data-sharing between different blockchains. Combined with AMM advances, cross-border stablecoin transactions are consistently becoming faster and cheaper. Circle’s EURC is a Euro-backed stablecoin fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). In 2024, researchers from Warwick Business School on-ramped in USD (USDC) and off-ramped in Euros (EURC) using Circle’s AMM. The researchers reported: Given that EURC is pegged to the Euro and USDC to the US dollar, trading in the EURC/USDC market should closely track developments in the traditional EUR/USD market. Indeed, we found that the blockchain market operates efficiently, with EURC/USDC prices staying within 20 basis points — or 0.2 percentage points — of traditional EUR/USD market prices. Furthermore, blockchain prices responded to macroeconomic information, such as interest rate announcements from the US Federal Reserve. The USD-backed stablecoins have primacy, and a USD-denominated SHC seems by far the most likely outcome. That said, some experts, such as former Binance.US CEO and 1Money founder Brian Shroder, predict a multicurrency stablecoin future. In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Shroder said, “We envision a global network powered by stablecoins representing all major currencies.” Equally, if interoperability protocols and AMM DeFi development continue to accelerate, such a multicurrency system is still likely to protect the USD. Those pushing USD dominance, such as the Thiel-led consortium behind the Global Dollar Network’s USDG stablecoin, with its proposed cross-chain interoperability, evidently have the edge. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) runs The Taskforce on Cross-border Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE Taskforce). The committee was formed in response to the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments (established in 2020 with the final stage three report published in 2023 — hereafter referred to as the G20 Roadmap), which, the BIS notes, seeks to enhance “cross-border payments’ speed and transparency, while increasing access to cross-border payment services and reducing their costs.” The G20 — short for Group of 20 — is an international forum comprised of 19 member states (including the US, the UK, Russia, China, and India) plus the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU). Formed in 1999, it is structured as a multipolar global forum of five internal groups with the aim of coordinating economic policy. The finance ministers and central bank governors of the respective G20 member states and of the EU and AU dominate G20 deliberations. An important contributor to the G20-and-BIS-aligned CPMI-PIE taskforce is Coinbase, which was accelerated into existence by Y-Combinator (see Part 1). Coinbase responded to the recent PIE consultation by making the point that all the G20 Roadmap targets could be met by properly regulated stablecoins. Coinbase observed that “a mixed-payments ecosystem” that supports “traditional bank rails and wholesale payments” can benefit from stablecoin adoption. The global digital ID network is being created from a range of “interoperable” but “vendor-agnostic” digital ID products. There won’t be just one global digital ID card or biometric ID product—such as a single facial recognition system. Instead, all such products and systems will export data using an agreed-upon machine-readable format. In the case of digital ID products and systems, they will comply with ISO/IEC 19794 Series and ISO/IEC 19785 biometric data interchange formats. Thus, it is entirely possible that a single global database, perhaps the World Bank’s ID4D or some similar global solution, could collect data from all the interoperable vendor-agnostic digital ID products and systems worldwide. The ID4D project is supporting the introduction of global interoperability standards that will be “capable of facilitating transactions in the digital age.” The International Organization for Standardization, abbreviated as ISO (not IOS), has an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. This standard, called “ISO 20022,” is explained as: [. . .] a global messaging standard designed to improve communication between financial institutions through structured, machine-readable messages. [. . .] ISO 20022 facilities interoperability and efficiency across payment systems, securities markets, and other financial domains. Its rich data fields and extensibility make it a cornerstone for modernizing global financial infrastructure. It goes without saying that the BIS — specifically its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) — is eager to embrace the ISO’s “payments data harmonisation,” which it announced last month. As noted by CentralBank.com, “A key factor in achieving more efficient cross-border payments is the use of the same data standards by all countries, and the ISO 20022.” ISO 20022-compliant stablecoins and underlying blockchains are emerging, according to a December 2024 article in CryptoNews.com. This innovation is being propelled by the multipolar G20 Roadmap and raises the potential of establishing a global “unified ledger” — or “shared ledger” — that effectively oversees every digital financial transaction on earth. In 2024, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, recognizable by its acronym, SWIFT, reported: The concept of a new, universal shared ledger for digital payments and assets is gaining interest as a way of transforming how transactions are recorded and settled. [. . .] In its Annual Economic Report 2023, the BIS presented its blueprint for a future monetary system, envisaging a new type of financial market infrastructure—a “unified ledger”—which could “capture the full benefits of tokenisation.” [. . .] [T]he shared ledger model could potentially help to improve the cost, speed, predictability and accessibility of cross-border payments — thereby supporting the G20 roadmap. [. . .] [A]n ISO 20022-based messaging layer will enhance the shared ledger proposition. A Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is being constructed, but, like its global digital ID counterpart, it is very unlikely to be one stablecoin or one digital asset or token. Rather, as Coinbase developers put it, the SHC will be a “mixed-payments ecosystem.” The SHC is going to be an interoperable network of “vendor-agnostic” digital tokens. Stablecoins are accelerating the SHC’s development. Interoperability, enabled by machine-readable data harmonisation, will revolutionise business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The race is on to seize control of the “new world” of regulated stablecoins. Peter Thiel and his protégés, working in partnership with Musk and others, have established a global network of tech and tech-finance companies that have been key drivers in creating a “new world currency.” That we find ourselves where we are today is no accident. In 2023, Tether’s new CEO, Paolo Ardoino, was under investigation by the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for potential sanction-busting financial activity. He submitted a letter to the committee in which he reported yet more evidence of the close relationship between leading players in the financial technology (FinTech) development community and the US defence-and-intelligence complex. Ardoino wrote: On December 1, 2023, we launched a wallet-freezing policy designed to significantly enhance the tools available for law enforcement agencies seeking to combat illicit use of stablecoins. [. . .] Tether recently onboarded the United States Secret Service into our platform and is in the process of doing the same with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These strategic relationships reinforce our commitment to supporting law enforcement. [. . .] We have assisted in freezing, as of the date of this letter, approximately 326 wallets totaling approximately USDT 435 Million for the Department of Justice, US Secret Service, and FBI. [. . .] We look forward to maintaining a close working relationship with law enforcement, policymakers, and regulators in shaping a secure, compliant, and resilient future for digital currencies. During the Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates in early 2022, commercial banks and payment providers facilitated the Canadian government’s demand to freeze protesters’ financial assets and disable supporters’ ability to donate to fundraising campaigns for the truckers. Similarly, the UK government is currently forming legislation that would allow authorities to access citizens’ bank accounts and seize control of their finances — under the guise of combatting fraud. In both of these examples of the public-private abuse of claimed authority, two mechanisms were and are needed to enforce tyranny: agreement (that is, the banks and payment providers’ willingness to collaborate) and legislation (either existing or new). But in a world of solely digital money, neither policy debates nor the passing of legislation are strictly necessary. Total surveillance of our use of money and the ability to programme our spending is innate to the “new world currency” —USD SHC. From humanity’s perspective, no matter where we reside, the most alarming aspect of digital currencies — stablecoins, retail CBDC, or otherwise — is their surveillance capabilities and, in particular, their programmability feature. Trump’s new executive order on digital finance suggests that instead of elected officials programming our money, this task should be handed over to multistakeholder partnerships. To understand why programmability is a risk to all of us, consider the words of Bo Li, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China and the current Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. In October 2022, Bo Li said: CBDC can allow government agencies and private sector players to program — to create smart contracts — to allow targeted policy functions. For example, welfare payments; for example, consumption coupons; for example, food stamps. By programming CBDC, [. . .] money can be precisely targeted [to] what kind of [things] people can own, and [the kinds of ways] this money can be utilised. Digital “money” can be programmed to automatically bar us from donating to the “wrong” cause or from transacting with certain “undesirable”individuals. Every transaction we make and all funds we receive will be recorded on the corresponding “ledger” (likely to be a blockchain) from which our financial activity will be monitored, analysed, and inspected. Such a system obviates the need for legislation to snoop into our bank accounts. China’s digital states — WeChat pay, and the similarly popular Alipay — are fully integrated with China’s e-CNY retail central bank digital currency (r-CBDC). China’s stakeholder capitalist approach to controlling its “customers” payments is not dissimilar to that currently being pursued in Ukraine—using its e-Hyrvnia r-CBDC—and a similar system is proposed by the Russian public-private state. The head of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, told the news outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the battle against cybercrime and financial fraud meant that the Russian retail CBDC — the digital ruble — would allow accounts to be blocked, depending on “certain rules.” Payment restrictions could be applied, transactions inspected and control measures taken “if necessary,” he said. Also adopting the stakeholder capitalism model, Aksakov said Russia’s “major telecom operators, cybersecurity experts and key IT companies,” alongside the commercial banks, would partner with the Russian government to put together these “new measures.” Looking to the future, he suggested “joint ventures” could include the “American banks,” adding that “Visa or Mastercard” could assist with the rollout of the digital ruble control measures. Like Bo Li, Anatolov also emphasised the social engineering potential of the digital ruble: Payments in the digital ruble can be linked to smart contracts, where the transfer or remuneration to the contractor is regulated by a computer program, not a person. [. . .] We are now focusing on using the digital ruble to control the targeted spending of the [fiscal] budget. [. . .] Should we convert maternity capital or child benefit into the digital ruble and make it so that they cannot be spent on alcohol and cigarettes? In my opinion this is a justified measure and such restrictions are necessary. The US is evidently taking a different path towards its proposed digital state, preferring cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for programmability. But irrespective of whether your government and its partners opt for the retail CBDC or the approved stablecoin route, the outcome is a digital surveillance and control system. Stablecoins are certainly no less programmable than CBDCs. Global outsourcing digital employment agency Rise observed: The programmability of stablecoins through smart contracts opens avenues for innovations such as machine-to-machine payments in IoT applications. [. . .] The future of stablecoin payments is bright, with ongoing innovations and increasing adoption promising to transform how we conduct financial transactions. These technological innovations portend much more than simply transforming “how we conduct financial transactions.” In its totality, interoperable, AI-controlled digital technology threatens to change every aspect of our lives. If it does, we should not lose sight of the fact that AI is programmed by motivated human beings who hold ideological beliefs. The Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB); advances in machine-to-machine (M2M) payments — with AI algorithms automatically deducting digital money from our digital wallets absent any human interaction –– and an interconnected network of smart homes on smart grids paints a dystopian future few of us wish to contemplate. Unfortunately, the enabling gov-corp Technates are being built. The digital currency powered smart home concept has already arrived. This is achieved by linking IoT powered homes to digital wallets overseen by surveillance of the smart grid to which they are attached. Howard Lutnick’s—Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce — investment in Satellogic, via Endeavour, places him and his partners in prime position to capitalise on what the WEF calls the “trillion dollar opportunity” presented by the Earth Observation industry (EO). Orbiting satellite networks harvest data from digital devices and the subsequent AI analyses of the gathered EO data is set to revolutionise pretty much every industrial sector. Now in office, Lutnick can be confident in his assertion that Satellogic and its investors, including Tether, are “uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry.” Just as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins in particular, are providing space for expansion of US debt, so to they are enabling accelerated investment in the development of the emerging “digital states.” Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, such as that being developed by Musk’s Neuralink, is bringing us closer to becoming “technoplastic beings.” It comes as no surprise that Peter Thiel is a Neuralink investor. Thiel also invests in Musk’s BCI competitors — Blackrock Neurotech is one. Again, Tether is also an investment partner of Blackrock Neurotech. There is evidently technological competition. On the one hand we have Musk’s Space X, Neuralink and X-pay, on the other we have Sattelogic, Blackrock Neurotech and Tether. But as we can see from Thiel’s investment strategy, it is the transhumanist and neurowarfare potential of BCI technology that excites technopopulist oligarchs. Competition stimulates development until the winning monopoly establishes itself. The programmable nature of the so-called “digital money,” combined with smart devices on smart grids, enabling precise monitoring of our energy use means that, de facto, “Energy Certificates” are being rolled out. Trump’s digital finance executive order does not nullify the threat posed by CBDCs. It simply diverts public attention away from the immense threat posed by programmable digital currency in general. Programmable, privately issued stablecoins are intended to avert the looming US debt crisis by absorbing US debt in cryptocurrencies. But the evident additional hope is that this tactic will give the US a head start in the race toward Technocracy. When Technocracy was designed in the 1930s, the scale of the surveillance and control system it proposed was soon discarded as unworkable. The idea of creating a bureaucracy capable of monitoring the energy use of every citizen and every business across a continent, using the technology of that day, was a fantastical proposition. Measuring a citizen’s or business’ energy usage via any kind of manageable monetary system, with expenditures controlled by linking the currency to identity, was simply not feasible. But today, not only is Technocracy finally technologically possible, the infrastructure for the rollout of Technocracy is ,as a result, being actively constructed. Technologically, such a dystopia is well within the realm of possibility. Do you imagine that the oligarchs behind the construction of the necessary infrastructure would never implement this digital panopticon? If so, perhaps it is time to ask yourself why they are building it. Is it simply because people like Elon Musk want us to live “lives of abundance”? To be clear: programmable money combined with digital ID is likely to enable oligarchs, via public-private partnership, to oversee “the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism”—that is, Technocracy. It will potentially give them total control of the distribution of “goods and services to the entire population.” In short, technological innovation has made a Technate eminently possible. The newly not-elected prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, is among the few, in the current crop of politicians, who is closely and directly connected to the globalist oligarchy. In a interview with Juno News, given shortly before he became prime minister, Mark Carney argued for the alleged benefits of said global oligarchy: I know how the world works, I know how to get things done, I’m connected. [. . .] People will charge me with being elitist or a globalist, to use that term, which is, well, that’s exactly, it happens to be exactly what we need. Carney’s proposed Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is intended to position the West in preparation for the emerging multipolar world order. It is obvious, therefore, that multipolarity poses no threat to globalist oligarchs. The so-called “global elite” have always been quite open about their ambitions, but Carney’s words suggest that they feel extra-emboldened at the moment. There is nothing new about their concept of a world split into more manageable “regions” or “poles,” but we do seem to be approaching the end of an inexorable path toward it. We do not have to take that path. It is not yet set in stone. Carney has openly told us that he and his globalist cronies have not haphazardly stumbled into his proposed SHC, nor have they randomly meandered into the clutches of a multipolar world order or its new IMFS. Conscious, deliberate decisions have been made, and specific steps have been taken, to bring about this state of affairs. There are people who insist that the push toward multipolarity is being led by the BRICS+ nations — in particular, the Russian and Chinese governments. President Putin and Paramount Leader Xi Jinping have been prominent advocates of multipolarity, for sure. Speaking in October 2024 in the lead-up to the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, Xi explained the multipolar vision. He said it is about fostering “inclusive economic globalization.” This can be done, he noted, by building “solidarity and cooperation” between countries. The BRICS (now BRICS+) project forms a bloc, or “pole,” of nation-states. It has already started to redesign globalism. As pointed out by former Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, who now chairs the New Development Bank (NDB) at the heart of the BRICS+ project, “measured by GDP, the BRICS countries have already surpassed the G7 in importance.” In truth, a multipolar world order has always been the penultimate destination prior to establishing full-blown, centralised global governance. The evidence supporting this conclusion is abundant. Renowned American historian, professor, and author Carroll Quigley meticulously catalogued the activities of the British/American oligarch network that was inspired by the imperial vision of the early-20th century Rhodes-Milner Group (also known as the Round Table Group). In a 1974 interview with Washington Post reporter Rudy Maxa, Quigley spoke about the “three-power world” that the network envisaged prior to WWII. The idea was that a transatlantic bloc and a united European bloc and an Eastern Soviet bloc would dominate a global “balance of power” structure. Following a 1956 Special Studies Project directed by Henry Kissinger at the request of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a 500-plus-page document titled Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports emerged (its copyright spans 1958–1961). The five reports in it aimed to define the problems and opportunities the US faced in the late 1950s, clarify national objectives, and develop a framework on which national policies could be based. The United Nations had already been established in 1945 (the UN headquarters was built on land donated by the Rockefellers), but, according to some of the panel report researchers, this international organisation hadn’t delivered on its goals. So, these researchers returned to the original prospect outlined by the Rhodes-Milner Group and suggested “a world divided into smaller units” [page 26] that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority” [page 26]: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] Fully developed, they imply a joint accord on monetary and exchange arrangements, a common discipline on fiscal matters, and a free movement of capital and labor. [. . . ] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. In October 1968, the Rockefellers supported the foundation of a globalist international policy think tank — the Club of Rome — to implement the “regional arrangements” that they had declared seven years earlier to be “no longer a matter of choice.” The 1973 third symposium of the WEF is considered by the WEF to have been an important moment in its history. At this event, Club of Rome co-founder Aurelio Peccei outlined the Club’s concept of the “sustainability of global economic growth” which, WEF delegates were told, required society to reconcile “economic development and environmental constraints.” Consequently, with this in mind, the WEF adopted “Klaus Schwab’s stakeholder concept.” In same year, September 1973, the Club of Rome wrote a confidential report titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System.” It proposed that the world be divided into ten “Kingdoms”—comparable to blocs, or poles. Though presented simply as an analytical computer model, the Club of Rome added a vision statement to its report: Our efforts in the immediate future will be concentrated on further use of the already developed [Kingdoms] model. [. . .] Implementation of the regional models in different parts of the world and their connection via a satellite communication network [will be] for the purpose of joint assessment of the long-term global future by teams from the various regions [Kingdoms or “poles”]. Implementation of the vision for the future outlined by leaders from an underdeveloped region in order to assess with the model existing obstacles and the means whereby the [multi-Kingdom or multipolar] vision might become a reality. More recently, World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab co-wrote, with Thierry Malleret, COVID-19: The Great Reset. One point they made in their book is that global supply chains are fragmenting due to global existential crises. They pinned the blame on a lack of cohesive global governance and offered a solution: The most likely outcome along the globalization–no globalization continuum lies in an in-between solution: regionalization. The success of the European Union as a free trade area or the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Asia (a proposed free trade agreement among the 10 countries that compose ASEAN) are important illustrative cases of how regionalization may well become a new watered-down version of globalization. [. . .] In short, deglobalization in the form of greater regionalization was already happening. COVID-19 will just accelerate this global divergence as North America, Europe and Asia focus increasingly on regional self-sufficiency rather than on the distant and intricate global supply chains that formerly epitomized the essence of globalization [page 79]. Shortly before the 2025 Munich Security Conference, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave an interview to Megyn Kelly where he said: [. . .] it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. [. . .] That was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. [. . .] [F]oreign policy has always required us to work in the national interest, sometimes in cooperation with people who we wouldn’t invite over for dinner or people who we wouldn’t necessarily ever want to be led by. And so that’s a balance, but it’s the sort of pragmatic and mature balance we have to have in foreign policy. Casting the multipolar world order as a confrontation between great powers but also a “pragmatic and mature balance,” Rubio’s comments were congruent with the view of the globalist think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—which has consistently promoted multipolarity. The CFR believes the international rules-based order (the unipolar model) is “disintegrating at an accelerating pace.” CFR fellow Thomas E. Graham sees five potential regional poles in a multipolar global governance system consisting of the US, China, India, Russia, and Europe. The CFR line of thinking is that the US can contribute to multipolarity through foreign policy that seeks to constrain China as a great power; nurture India as a power, preserve Russian power and promote European power. Europe is considered the greatest challenge by the CFR because, despite its economic and possible military might, it “lacks political cohesion.” Therefore, in January 2025 the CFR argued for a new US foreign policy mindset “to encourage Europe to assume the responsibilities of a great power [. . .], one that has the hard power needed to deal with most security contingencies in its immediate neighborhood.” In March 2025, the Trump administration’s very public press conference spat with the visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was immediately followed by the US supposedly withholding military aid to Ukraine. This was met with seeming condemnation from the US’ European partners who responded by publicly announcing an €800 billion ($841.5 billion) “ReArm Europe” plan. This gives further impetus to the EU’s long-held desire for European military unification. It seems that Trump’s order not to supply US arms to Ukraine doesn’t apply to Thiel-backed enterprises like Anduril. While Trump was telling American and European voters that the US would not supply arms, Anduril was finalising a deal with the UK government to send their Altius 600m and Altius 700m attack drones to Ukraine. It is hard to say if the press conference between Trump (the former reality TV personality) and Zelenskyy (the former actor and TV comedian) was entirely staged or not. Obviously, both presidents were, at the very least, briefed prior to their quite extraordinary public row. What is not in doubt is that the trajectory of the global policy response is precisely as modelled and suggested by the think-tanks. Elon Musk’s ‘X’ social media platform is, at the time of writing, heavily promoting Trump as the global peace maker who just wants to stop the slaughter in Ukraine. Consequently, the public debate swirling across the entire western media and social media landscape is polarising opinion between those who want peace and those who argue this is short-sighted appeasement and Ukraine must keep fighting to stave off “Putin’s aggression.” Meanwhile, the globalist plans for a multipolar world order are surging ahead regardless of which of those two, pre-determined options is championed by the US or any other government. Political leaders, influential financiers, and representatives of policy think tanks across the West have evidently been planning for some time, even enthusiastically endorsing, construction of a regionalised multipolar world order. Their fundamentally globalist project is the latest iteration of the oligarchs’ persistent dream: global governance under their exclusive control. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is ostensibly a transatlantic forum where hi-ranking so-called “thought leaders” engage in a “marketplace of ideas.” The self-appointed glitterati discuss, plan and agree security and defence policy trajectories. The theme of MSC 2025 was “Multipolarization.” In the executive summary for the Munich Security Report 2025 we are told that “multipolarization is a fact.” Again, presenting us with the idea that things just happen organically: there is no design. We are given to understand that those who are positive about multipolarity see “opportunities for more inclusive global governance and greater constraints on Washington.” Whereas, those who are more pessimistic believe it “increases the risk of disorder.” The report notes the international enthusiasm for the United Nations 2024 Pact for the Future, replete with its Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Following the UN’s “quiet revolution,” the Pact is grounded in stakeholder capitalism’s public-private partnerships and “draws on the energy and expertise of governments, civil society and other key partners.” The UN Pact promises more public-private global censorship, centralised world economic and financial control partnerships (global taxation), and firmer mechanisms for global governance partnerships to seize control of nation states as deemed necessary. The MSC thought leaders conclude “for this cooperation [UN Pact] to materialize, the world could well use some ‘depolarization’.” The evident plan is for the global order to undergo a process of creative destruction to deterritorialize it in its current form and reterritorialize it as a more efficient multipolar global governance structure. To this end the MSC report notes: The next four years will show whether a more selectively engaged US fuels or contains global disorder. As other actors will (have to) step up to fill the gap, the multipolarization of the international system could accelerate. Despite US policy decisions supposedly being designed to confront and oppose China, again, as a result of the same US policy decisions, China has shown it is ready to “fill the gap.” In his MSC speech the head of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission — China’s foreign minister — H.E. Wang Yi said: [. . .] we should work for an equal and orderly multipolar world. [. . .] China will surely be a factor of certainty in this multipolar system, and strive to be a steadfast constructive force in a changing world. [. . .] The U.N. is at the core of practicing multilateralism and advancing global governance. [. . .] We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N. J.D. Vance address to the MSC has been reported as harsh criticism of European censorship of its citizen’s and its media, especially with reference to the censorship of US commentators. Within his criticisms, Vance also advocated construction of a European “pole”: [. . .] the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. [. . .] [W]e think it’s an important part of being in a shared alliance together that the Europeans step up while America focuses on areas of the world that are in great danger. The extremely rapid response to the US foreign policy shift toward Ukraine has stimulated EU military unification and rearmament. This is entirely in keeping with the strategies and plans laid out by globalist policy think-tanks. Perhaps random events collide and every decision is nothing more than a reaction, but the weight of evidence thoroughly contradicts mere “coincidence theory.” We are supposed to believe that US isolationism is the pessimistic response to multipolarity while the more positive multilateral approach is closer aligned to the essence of the UN’s Pact for the Future. Either way, both pessimistic isolationism and positive multilateralism seem likely to accelerate multipolar global governance. Despite the different approaches, the geopolitical outcomes are seemingly indivisible. Both portend a regionalised world order bureaucracy and this has always been the planned administrative reorganisation of the planet prior to imposing firm global governance and, ultimately, global government. The Trump administration is blatantly declaring its isolationism. Trump, has publicly withdrawn from the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement, and the US pact with the OECD to work on a Global Tax Deal. He has imposed international trade tariffs and his toughening of US border security is apparently one of the primary reasons he was re-elected. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann has already said Trump’s posturing was interpreted as “concerns raised.” Cormann also said the OECD would “keep working with the U.S. and all countries at the table to support international cooperation that promotes certainty, avoids double taxation, and protects tax bases.” Trump may be haggling for a stronger negotiating position, and we should certainly take his grand statements with a pinch of salt. That said, if we put all this together, what we see is a distinct narrative shift toward polarisation. It is important to stress that we’re witnessing a full-on propaganda offensive. Nevertheless, we are supposed to believe that there are real geopolitical tensions between the EU and the US, not just in relation to Ukraine, but in relation to Greenland. The European Council President António Costa said Denmark had the EU’s “full support” in the Danish government’s alleged confrontation with the US government. Trump has also made aggressive gestures toward BRICS+, warning that tariffs will rain down if the group dumps the USD. Meanwhile, one of he BRICS+ leading nations Russia has said that Trump’s “withdrawal” from the WHO risks “dangerous consequences.” Alexei Kurinney, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Health, said that “from the point of view of protecting exclusively the interests of the United States, this is an isolationist step.” In response to seeming US isolationism, the Chinese government has also criticised the US withdrawals from the WHO and from the Paris Agreement. As we’ve just highlighted, China has offered itself as a reliable global partner to these two entities. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: China is concerned about the US announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. [. . .] Climate change is a common challenge that all of humanity must face. [. . .] The role of the World Health Organization should only be strengthened, not weakened. The stage is clearly set for the final push toward the multipolar world order. But, strange as it may seem, this very push toward multipolarity is bringing the nations closer to a single global political, economic, and (perhaps most notably) financial and monetary “union.” In other words, multipolarity, as it is presented to us, appears to be a monumental psychological operation (psyop). There have been many attempts over the years to form a North American Union (NAU), which would be composed of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. This geopolitical goal received a boost in 1994 with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the plan stalled after receiving strong resistance by the populace of all three countries. On and off, the US government has made numerous attempts to pry Greenland away from Denmark — more often than not citing US defence needs. Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Its inhabitants are therefore citizens of Denmark and, by extension, of the European Union. In 1951, the US and Danish governments signed the Defense of Greenland Treaty, which ostensibly appeased US national security concerns. The US maintains the Pituffik Space Base — formerly known as Thule Air Base — on the island of Greenland. Greenland has never been mentioned with respect to any proposed versions of either a North American Union or a free trade agreement. The prospect of building the Praxis gov-corp Technate on Greenland has evidently reignited enthusiasm. The original American technocrats, however, did include Greenland, along with Caribbean island states and Central American states — as far south as the northernmost territory of South America’s Columbia and Venezuela — in their proposed model of a North American Technate. Prior to this year’s inauguration, Trump outlined his dreams of establishing what can only be described as a plan almost geographically identical to Technocracy Inc.’s original North American Technate. In a series of off-the-wall-sounding statements — not unusual for him — Trump indicated that he wanted to add Greenland, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama to a NAU of Mexico, the US, and Canada. He even threatened the use of force, both economic and military, to construct a geopolitical map that is exactly mirrors the aforementioned North American Technate. There is no realistic prospect, in any geopolitical sense, of this imaginary North American Technate actually being formed. But, as we have already discussed, the Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy portend a kind of geopolitics more reminiscent of the system of city states ruled by the Venetian bankers. The Venetian city state was perhaps the most powerful seasteading project the world has ever known. Trumps seemingly weird ideas about seizing control of Gaza and Greenland, as if they can simply be acquired as sovereign states, and where the sovereignty of the people living there is considered “with derision,” is the epitome of the Dark Enlightenment thinking. Forced displacement of the “unthinking demos” is meaningless if you fervently believe “the system must be first.” The North American Technate map that Trump appeared to deliberately outline first appeared on the cover of the Technocracy Study Course. Yet even the original technocrats didn’t explain how all these nation-states would fall in line with their unhinged ideas. Ironically, the technological advances that have today made the prospect of a Technate feasible have also rendered the concept of a geographical Technate moot. By its nature, global communication technology globalises. The technocrats’ notion of a geographically bounded political Technate has largely been subsumed by the globalist oligarchs’ rollout of global governance architecture and technology. The Club of Rome’s Ten Kingdom model was precisely that: a model. While it is obvious there has been a global effort to make that model a functioning reality, it is clear that the gov-corp Technates under construction will first and foremost be economic and financial administrative zones rather than physical or geopolitical nations as we understand them. The technology used to construct each digital state is common to all. Gov-corp realms may be distinct, with, for example, Amazon dominating its sov-corp realm in the West and the Alibaba-Group dominating its sov-corp realm the East, but the “patchwork of realms” will be global. The decentralisation toward the digital city state is the network enabling centralised control. The formation of regionalised poles looks more like bureaucratic reorganisation in preparation for a simplified global governance administration of realms. Nonetheless, the symbology of Trump’s otherwise bizarre imperial statements seems relatively easy to interpret. Trump and/or his close advisers want to make it clear that Technocracy and the Dark enlightenment are the ideas driving the administration. I suspect Trump will say whatever he is told to say, within reason, on this subject or any other. In my opinion, posturing as a would-be emperor probably appeals to his ego. Personally, I doubt Trump even understands what a gov-corp Technate is, but he may. Whatever the case, the communicated signal could not be made more obvious: The neoreactionary technocrats are in control. Thiel and Musk are not the leading architects of the project to establish the global gov-corp Technate. But they are firm believers and, as made men, have been positioned to lead the US in that direction. Ultimately, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution renders the very concept of the nation-state superfluous. The technocrats and accelerationist neoreactionaries know this. Oligarchs have never had an affinity for one nation more than for any other. The system they seek ignores nation-states completely. If their plan succeeds, the only borders that will still have any relevance to them will be those delineating the “Kingdoms” or “poles” of a much-simplified multipolar global governance structure overseeing a network of realms. Once the mycelium-like global financial network is thriving and once seamless cross-border transactions are instantaneous — enabled by a digital SHC fit for a multipolar world — then geographical political borders will cease to have any economic or monetary meaning. As Peter Thiel observed in a 2001 PayPal all-hands meeting: The ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related. The global system of gov-corp Technates that is emerging represents the most oppressive, totalitarian system of absolute behavioural control ever devised. There will be no need for government policy when entire populations — comprised of millions of individual human beings who were born to think for themselves — can be mentally hijacked and literally programmed by corporate behemoths. But of all the psyops foisted upon us, the greatest among them is the millennia-long propaganda campaign to make us believe we are powerless. This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the “representative democracy” charade. Recognising the staggering audacity of the globalists’ plans and the enormous resources they presently have under their command is not to be “blackpilled.” On the contrary, it is the first step toward liberation. In order to resist the maniacs, we first have to understand what they’re doing and how and why they’re doing it. After that, the only hurdle we must surmount is that of putting all of our own solutions into effect. Our solutions do not have to reimagine the world, we just have to reimagine our tiny portion of it. You don’t need to worry about energy costs if you are energy self sufficient—or as close to it as you can be. You don’t need to be too preoccupied with food prices if you grow it yourself or barter goods and services with those that do, and you don’t need to be overly concerned with exchange rates if you choose your own medium of exchange and trade with other like-minded people in your own community. International financial institutions do not control “money.” Oligarch investors do not control technological development. Governments do not control populations. Only deception, coercion and the use of force ensures these false perceptions. Deception works by bombarding people with propaganda and psyops. Coercion and manipulation are designed to convince us to accept that which we can — and must — decisively reject. Force will almost certainly be used if we do, but there are also eight billion of us. There are better alternatives to top-down oligarch control. Despite the hopes of Musk and Thiel and their ilk, gov-corp Technates are not inevitable. We need only peaceably decline to obey their demented edicts, quit subscribing to their insane schemes, and build something better.

March 15, 2025 08:37 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In Merck To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in Merck between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: An AI stock picker that beat the S&P 500 last year is dumping tech stocks — but holding on to these Magnificent 7 firms

Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that. Qraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR). But this year's volatile market has led the fund — which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market — to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way. AMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider. "In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month," Tam said. A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date. "Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech," Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now. Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS). The AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%). Even though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock. "We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development," Tam said. As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker. "We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot," Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm. AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla — the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick. The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. "Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.

Yambo The Demented has directed the Pentagon to prepare plans for carrying out his threat to "take back" the Panama Canal, including by military force if needed, two U.S. officials familiar with the situation said Thursday. Via Common Dreams: According to the outlet, the officials said that U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) is drawing up potential plans that run the gamut from working more closely with Panama's military to a less likely scenario in which U.S. troops invade the country and take the canal by force. They also said that SOUTHCOM commander Adm. Alvin Holsey has presented draft strategies to be reviewed by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is scheduled to visit Panama next month. The officials explained that the likelihood of a U.S invasion depended on the level of cooperation shown by the Panamanian military. Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out use of military force to seize control of the vital U.S.-built waterway, as well as Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. Last week during his joint address to Congress, Trump proclaimed that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal," but his administration has not clarified precisely what "reclaiming" entails. If his family wants to keep the grift going so badly, they don't want to put him in a nice memory care facility, maybe the cabinet members can do that 24th Amendment thingie? Maybe he sees a giant rabbit! After all, what Donnie Darko is proposing is a violation of international law! We know he can't read. Will Pete Hegseth act it out for him with toy boats? The Republican president says the U.S. needs to retake control of the Panama Canal to enhance "economic security," and has falsely claimed that the waterway is "operated by China." Earlier this month, the New York-based investment firm BlackRock led a group of investors in a $23 billion deal to purchase ports at both ends of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, an agreement Trump dubiously seized upon as proof that "we've already started" reclaiming the conduit. Panamanian President José Raúl Molina countered that "the Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed... The canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!"

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Title: Panama holds 'firm' as US mulls military options for canal takeover

Iran Press TV Friday, 14 March 2025 5:50 AM Panama City has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining independence following reports that US President Donald Trump is considering measures to "reclaim" the Panama Canal. NBC reported on Thursday that the White House had asked the military to come up with options to "reclaim" the Panama Canal. The American television network said the White House had directed the US military to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama to fulfil Trump's desire of "reclaiming" the Panama Canal, according to two US officials familiar with the planning. In response, Panama's government emphasized on Thursday that it would remain "firm" in defending its sovereignty and the Panama Canal. "With respect to these statements, I have nothing more to say than that Panama remains firm in defending its territory, its canal, and its sovereignty," Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters. "Let it be clear, the canal belongs to the Panamanians and will remain so," he added. The Trump administration's goal is reportedly to increase the US military presence in Panama to diminish China's influence there, particularly access to the canal. Also, in his joint address to Congress last week, Trump insisted that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal." Trump's remarks came after the US firm BlackRock and a consortium of investors announced a deal to buy two ports at either end of the canal from a Chinese firm. Already, the US military has reportedly more than 200 troops in Panama, but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out. The US formally took over control from the French of building the canal in 1904. After 10 years the US-controlled canal became operational. In 1999, the US relinquished control and the canal was formally handed over to Panama. The artificial 82-kilometer waterway connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean.

Title: Ross Gerber sees no upside to Tesla stock. Here are the trades he's making instead.

Time Published: 2025-03-15T08:15:01Z

Ross Gerber, known as a longtime backer of Tesla, sees no upside in the stock after its latest wipeout. So, where is he seeing opportunity instead? In a recent interview with BI, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management broke down some of his recent market moves amid the ongoing stock correction. Gerber, who is a long-term investor, was hunting for value on Monday when the Nasdaq Composite plunged 4% in its worst day since the 2022 bear market. "I actually bought a little Nvidia yesterday," Gerber said, referencing the Monday sell-off. He also purchased shares of JPMorgan and Meta Platforms during the decline. For Nvidia, it's all about valuation. The AI stock sold off as much as 30% from its January peak amid tariff headwinds and fears of lower-than-expected profit margins. But Gerber highlighted that the stock is trading way too cheap given its elevated growth rate. "You could actually buy Nvidia at 20x earnings and their expected earnings are expected to go up 75% this year and they're buying back stock," Gerber remarked. Bank stocks are also cheap, Gerber said, specifically highlighting JPMorgan as a name he's buying "Banks will have a pretty good year with less regulation, and banks are cheap," Gerber said. JPMorgan is the largest bank in America and currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2x, a 45% discount to the S&P 500's valuation multiple. Other stocks Gerber had a positive view on included GE Vernova, a renewable energy spin-off from General Electric, TKO Group, which owns UFC and WWE, and Disney. But perhaps the most surprising trade made by Gerber recently was selling the bulk of his bitcoin and using some of the proceeds to buy gold. Gerber said that after years of trading bitcoin, he's learned his lesson about its high volatility and was eager to take profits after the postelection surge. "For my fund, we raised our allocation to 4% and then we made good money on it, so we were up big. But I've learned my lesson over the years trading bitcoin, it's just like I gotta take my money," Gerber said. Regarding gold, Gerber said the uncertainty around the Trump administration should be a tailwind for the risk-off metal. "People buy gold, other countries will buy gold, Europe will buy gold, and just the idea that when you have volatility, there's really only one asset that is meant to really offset that," Gerber said. "It used to be Treasurys and gold, but Treasurys don't actually perform that way as much anymore. I would argue there are substantial risks in Treasurys with this government, so the truth is gold is a really good place if things go crazy," he added. Gold hit a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday. The precious metal is up 13% year-to-date.

St. Patrick’s Day is right around the corner and it’s time to paint the town green. In every nook and cranny of Ireland, volunteer parade committees are getting ready to unleash marching bands, colourful clubs and bonkers floats on our streets, creating a riot of sound and colour to celebrate Lá Fhéile Pádraig. To find out what’s happening near you, click on our interactive map below. Over half a million people are expected to line the streets of Dublin for the National St Patrick’s Day Parade, which begins at noon. Over 4,000 people will be taking part in the spectacle, with Grand Marshal Victoria Smurfit leading the way. Fresh from their RTÉ Choice Music Prize win, Kabin Crew will act as Grand Marshal for the Cork city parade at 1 p.m., while trad music icon Sharon Shannon will be front and centre over in Galway. Over 30,000 people are expected to watch the parade in the City of the Tribes, which gets under way at 11.30 a.m. Local sporting heroes will lead quite a number of parades around the country, with Paralympic silver medallist Róisín Ní Ríain honoured to take on the role in the Treaty City at noon and three-time Olympian Thomas Barr acting as Grand Marshal in Waterford city at 1 p.m. Limerick St Patrick's Day parade 2024. Photo: Don Moloney None other than golf star Leona Maguire will lead the Ballyconnell parade in Cavan and FAI Cup champions Drogheda Utd will set the pace in their hometown while up the road in Dundalk, Collette O’Hagan – the first Irish female athlete to complete 1,000 marathons – will act as Grand Marshal. The variety of themes for this year’s parades will no doubt result in some fantastic surprises on the day, as creative minds turn their wild ideas into thrilling floats. Showbiz will be inspiring a number of events this year, with Wicked (Ballincollig), That’s Entertainment (Clane) and Movie Magic – The Oscars (Kilmallock) among the themes. People should Bee the Change in Tipperary town or show Whatever Floats your Boat in Cobh; meanwhile, up in Donegal, Ballyshannon will be celebrating the life and works of Rory Gallagher to coincide with his 30th anniversary. As always, plenty of places are offering a little something extra as part of their St. Patrick’s Day celebrations. In Doonbeg, a dog ‘pawrade’ will precede the traditional event, as will a leprechaun chase at Blackrock in Dublin, while a charity duck race will be held in Kilcock once all the marching is done. For those who want to go a little greener on this greenest of days, a pedal-powered parade will take place in Cavan’s Mountnugent, while the great wheelbarrow parade is pencilled in for Thomastown in Kilkenny. Those very impatient folk who simply can’t wait for St. Patrick’s Day to arrive might like to know that a maritime parade and fireworks will take place in Kinsale the night before, while on the day itself, the traditional Dingle Fife and Drum March takes place at 6 a.m. – more than six hours before the main parade. On the flipside, those who like their parades short and sweet also have options – Oram in Monaghan calls itself the shortest parade in the world, while Curragraigue in Wexford describes itself as the ‘smallest’ and ‘least well-known’. A whole weekend of festivities are being planned in a number of towns. Queen Maeve is the theme for the Sligo St. Patrick’s Festival, the highlights of which include performances by Sharon Shannon and Ruaille Buaille plus an attempt to break the world record for gathering the most leprechauns together. In Drogheda, there will be a carnival, market, leprechaun hunt and plenty of music throughout the weekend.

The St Patrick’s Festival Kilkenny has expanded to a four-day event this year and will feature live entertainment, American marching bands, a market, walking tours and a vintage fairground. Kilkenny Tradfest will also take place over the bank holiday weekend, ensuring music-lovers will be spoiled for choice in the Marble City.

Title: There’s more to New Zealand wine than Marlborough sauvignon
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/drink/2025/03/15/john-wilson-theres-more-to-new-zealand-wine-than-marlborough-sauvignon/

Full Content:
We have an ongoing love affair with Marlborough sauvignon in this country. Those lifted aromas, bright fresh fruit and zingy lime acidity are a winning combination that draws us back time after time. It has been 50 years since the first grapevines were planted in Marlborough, and the region has expanded hugely in that period. So what is it that makes this wine so special? As every visitor is warned, New Zealand has high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun that requires the application of sun block on a regular basis. This UV light allows grapes to ripen at lower temperatures, thereby retaining acidity, while the constant wind (“our secret weapon”, one winemaker told me) keeps temperatures down. In addition, the cool night-time temperatures and warm days allow the grapes to ripen slowly and evenly. Marlborough, named “Kei puta te Wairau” or “the place with the hole in the cloud” by the Māori has even less cloud cover and more sunshine than other parts of the country. However, similar conditions can also be found in other parts of New Zealand and with other grape varieties too. Waipara and Nelson, both a short drive from Marlborough, produce some great white wines, including sauvignon. But New Zealand grows a range of other white grapes (as well as some reds) including Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris and even Albariño. All of these share the same lively acidity and succulent ripe fruit that make them a great food-friendly alternative to sauvignon blanc. One of each grape variety is featured below. Lightly honeyed with succulent textured nectarines, orchard fruits and vibrant acidity. This would go nicely with Asian prawn dishes.

March 14, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC: GRLT), a leading luxury real estate development firm, today announced its full-year financial results for 2024, marking a transformative year following the successful merger with Primior Inc. The company reported $2.67 million in total revenue, a 425% increase in EBITDA, a strengthened gross margin of 87%, and a major investment in real estate tokenization technology. With total assets reaching $29.37 million, Primior continues to expand its footprint in luxury real estate development and technology-driven investment strategies. Primior Holdings Inc. Reports Strong 2024 Performance: $2.67M Revenue and Pioneering Advances in Real Estate Tokenization “These results demonstrate Primior’s ability to scale operations while improving profitability and strategically investing in the future,” said Johnney Zhang, CEO of Primior Holdings Inc. “Our 425% EBITDA growth reflects strong operational execution, while our investment in Gaia, our asset tokenization platform, is setting the foundation for next-generation real estate investment. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value through expansion, innovation, and financial strength.” 2024 Financial Performance Highlights Balance Sheet Strength & Liquidity Gaia: Primior’s Strategic Investment in Asset Tokenization A key highlight of the year was Primior’s $750,000 investment in the research and development of Gaia, the company’s asset tokenization-as-a-service platform. Gaia aims to revolutionize real estate investing by enabling fractional ownership of assets via blockchain technology, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in property investment. We plan to continue investing a significant portion of our earnings into the development of Gaia, as we believe tokenization is the future of the market. As Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has stated, "Tokenization is the next generation of markets," and Primior intends to take a leadership position in driving this revolution with Gaia. This platform is poised to disrupt the financial market and fundamentally change how people own real estate in the future. Investor Outlook: Shares Poised for Higher Valuation With total assets of $29.37 million and 3.85 billion outstanding common shares, this equates to an approximate asset value of $0.0076 per share—a figure that reflects Primior’s strong real estate holdings but not yet its full growth potential. Additionally, earnings per share (EPS) of $0.00031 provide a baseline that does not fully account for anticipated revenue growth from new developments, Gaia’s launch, and ongoing operational efficiencies.

Title: Reports: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Requests Military Options for Unfettered Panama Canal Access

Time Published: 2025-03-14T22:45:55Z
Full Content:
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked defense officials to “provide credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal,” according to reports. CNN reported that the request was outlined in a memo sent to senior leaders titled “Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance,” which replaces the 2022 National Defense Strategy and will guide the Department of Defense in line with President Donald Trump’s vision. NBC News reported that U.S. Southern Command presented draft strategies to Hegseth this week and that potential strategies include “simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it.” Other options reportedly under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks. Trump’s goal is to take control of the 50-mile canal and counter China’s growing influence over the area, out of concern China could shut down the canal to American shipping and the U.S. military in the event of a conflict. Banana declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China after Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February warned Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino to reduce Chinese influence or face potential retaliation. Hegseth will reportedly visit Panama next month. Last week, Trump said, “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” As NBC News reported, BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90 percent stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion. An official told NBC News the U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, some of them Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats. CNN reported that Hegseth’s memo outlined the Trump administration’s priorities as securing the U.S. border, reinforcing the U.S.’s presence in the Western Hemisphere, and focusing on China. It also reportedly called for European allies to step up as “allies — not dependents,” called for providing military aid to Israel and continuing to arm Arabian Gulf partners, and called for greater military cooperation between Israel and the Sunni Gulf states.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: Trump’s Restructuring of the U.S. Empire – Tariffs, Eliminating USAID, Ending Ukraine War and more. Jack Rasmus

The policies animating sectors of the world, from the Democratic benches in Washington, to the Mainstream corporate media, to EU leaders throughout Europe, are shaking up the globe. They could lead to the end of NATO as we have known it. America gobbling up land masses in the Western Hemisphere, including Canada, and more. Dr. Jack Rasmus says that this is not an instance of Trump losing his mind. It is a determined decision to restructure the U.S. economy – the fourth in a series of other restructurings that took place since 1917-1918. The following is an excerpt of the entire discussion carried out between Dr. Rasmus and Michael Welch on the Global Research News Hour on Friday March 14. Dr. Jack Rasmus, Ph.D Political Economy, was a former teacher of economics at St. Mary’s College in California. He is the author and producer of the various nonfiction and fictional workers, including the books The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy From Reagan to Bush, Clarity Press, October 2019; Alexander Hamilton & The Origins of the Fed, Lexington books, March 2019; and Central Bankers at the End of Their Ropes: Monetary Policy and the Coming Depression. Jack is the host of the weekly radio show, Alternative Visions, on the Progressive Radio Network, and a journalist writing on economic, political and labor issues. His site is jackrasmus.com and his twitter handle is @drjackrasmus. Global Research: Greenland and the Panama Canal were threatened with annexation, possibly with military force by Trump. Is America turning back to the 19th century Monroe Doctrine imperial conquest, or are they making nightmare threats to get a less harsh goal? Jack Rasmus: No, the empire is consolidating, restructuring. You know, we’ve had these periodic restructurings of the American empire for over a century now. World War I was the first as the U.S., after it finished its first imperial foray offshore the continent with the Spanish-American War, 1898-1903. You know, that war was funded by taxing property owners, and it didn’t go over very well. And the U.S. imperialists knew that, you know, if they were going to participate in a conflict in Europe, which was imminent by 1912, that they would have to restructure. They could not participate in that, and nor could the U.S. empire, now beginning to economically move offshore, really play with the European empires if it did not have a position in terms of its currency and its military. So what happened in World War I was we created a central bank, the Federal Reserve, which was really dominated and run by the New York banks. That’s why the New York Fed to this day handles all the international transactions and the currency issues, you see. It’s kind of like the central bank within the central bank. And we created a new fiscal system based upon the corporate income tax, which, by the way, taxed mostly the rich. The working class was not covered because they weren’t making enough money by the income tax in 1916-17. So we had a new fiscal monetary policy. And after World War I, of course, the U.S. dollar became the co-currency along with the British pound, and the U.S. stepped on to the global stage. Well, another restructuring occurred with World War II. And in that one, obviously, the dollar and the U.S. became the hegemonic economy and country in the world. The Brits and the French had to pretty much sign over their empires to the U.S. They kept vestiges of it and then lost that. And we had a new monetary policy and a new fiscal policy, a new industrial policy, and a new external policy. So every time you have a restructuring, it’s usually related to the empire either expanding its role, participating, or the third restructuring, which followed in the wake of the collapse economic crisis of the 1970s, economic and political. A third restructuring has been called neoliberalism, occurred late 70s, early 80s, and expanded in various ways throughout it. We had a new mix of fiscal, monetary, industrial, external policies that enabled the U.S. empire to expand once again. It was really a class-based policy, neoliberalism, and it was about taming its capitalist challengers, which were Japan and Europe at the time, and weakening its non-capitalist challenger, the Soviet Union. It proved to be successful. It also was successful in attacking working class and their unions in the U.S. and the social movements and so forth. So it was very successful imperial policy. That’s how you need to understand neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, I’ve always said, is kind of an obfuscating term. It’s really about imperialism and class-based politics. So that neoliberalism succeeded for several decades, but then the contradictions, as I argue in my new book, began to intensify in the 21st century. And since the 2008 crash, and then the 2020 crash, and in between slow growth, what we’ve had is an increasing inability of the neoliberal policies to deliver for the empire. And what we have today is the empire as it’s structured here in the neoliberal period is unaffordable. They’ve got to restructure it with the purpose of reducing the cost or moving the costs to areas of the empire that are considered more fundamental and more strategic. The U.S. has decided, at least this wing under Trump, has decided that the Ukraine war at $350 billion is a waste of money. The trillions of dollars thrown into the Middle East with the war against terrorism and certain countries hasn’t produced significant results. And NATO is a waste of money. NATO doesn’t need, we don’t need to keep providing a security umbrella to Europe. And that’s what Trump keeps saying. He says, pay your own way. I mean, you know, you’re rich enough. Why are we paying your way? Well, we’re paying their way so they can maintain these nice social program and benefits for their population because they don’t have to fund a defense. Now, of course, they’re trying to realize they have to do that now. And what we’re going to see in Europe is funding warfare at the expense of welfare. That’s coming. And even their media is talking about that, Financial Times and others. So that’s in progress right now. We can return to that topic. But what it means is that the U.S. is cutting its costs, you know, whether it’s NATO, whether it’s Ukraine, whether it’s the Middle East, whether it’s the 800 bases around the world, whether it’s USAID and NED and all the other wasted expenditures, which are part of the empire. And it’s looking back into the Western Hemisphere and saying, well, you know, we’ve got to shore up our strategic homeland here, which is North America, Western Hemisphere. And that’s how you got to understand Greenland and the Panama Canal. You see, this isn’t crazy Trump. This is very conscious policy. They know what they’re doing here. What they’re doing in Greenland is they’re trying to, America’s trying to develop an Arctic strategy. It’s way behind the curve with Russia’s Arctic strategy, which is well developed. The U.S. virtually has no Arctic strategy, even though it has Greenland at the western side of its Arctic. I mean, Alaska, it wants Greenland at the eastern side. Right. And then, of course, it’s got to somehow get the northern Canadian territories in shape here for that Arctic strategy, because as the Arctic clearly is, you know, the ice cap is disappearing, it’s opening up a transition, a pathway for Russia and especially China to Europe. That’s a strategic estuary or whatever you want to call it there on the western side of Greenland. So, the U.S. wants to consolidate that in Arctic strategy, control, basically prevent the flow of Chinese commercial shipping through that pathway there. And there are rare earths in Greenland that they want to exploit. Panama is similar. Panama is about checking China. You see, China has been buying up properties and deepening its influence within the Panamanian government. And the U.S. is no, no, no. And it’s already taken moves, put pressure on the Panamanian government, which has cut a number of projects, economic projects, with China as a result. Also, the Panama Canal needs to be enlarged significantly. And Panama doesn’t have the money and doesn’t want to do the enlargement. Why? Because the new Ford class U.S. aircraft carriers can’t make it through the canal as it exists. So, it’s strategic in that sense. And in the latest development, BlackRock recently just bought up the ports on both sides of the Panama Canal as the beginning of this. And the Panamanian government is backing down and talking about more U.S. control and influence of the canal itself. So, both the canal and Greenland are part of long-term strategic moves to check Russia and to check China. And that’s how it should be seen. And to talk about the 51st state of Canada is really to put pressure on Canada, I think, to really go along with the developing of a Northern Arctic strategy and also as a way of Trump raising funds through tariffs in order to also help fund the restructuring of the empire. You see, it’s not just saving foreign aid and foreign adventures and unnecessary expenditures abroad, but it’s also the tariffs, the primary objective. There’s two objectives of Trump’s tariffs. One is to politically browbeat allies and whomever for political objectives. Like in Mexico, it’s all about really the immigration and fentanyl flows and so forth. And it works. It works. Well, we saw the same thing with Panama. It works because Trump found in his first term, even though his trade strategy failed to check China, it did raise significant revenues. And Biden continued those revenues, by the way. And Trump sees revenues as a key way of reducing the debt and the budget deficit by raising revenues, but also as a way of moving the expenditure cuts, whether they’re in Europe or wherever, or whether you raise money, to move that money into new weapons investments. You see, the US is way behind China and even Russia in drone technology and in hypersonics and ballistic missiles and so forth, and AI and so forth. Well, it’s pretty much in a big competition with China for AI. But there’s a lot of crash weapons programs that need to be funded, and the empire structure cannot fund it now because it’s throwing away all hundreds of billions of dollars every year in places that aren’t strategic to US interests anymore. Ukraine is not strategic to US interests, and even conflict with Russia is not strategic Russia per se. The big challenge to the empire is the BRICS and the Global South, which is really the most serious challenge, I think, to the empire, certainly even more so than both Japan and Europe and Soviet Union during the 80s. The Global South in the 80s was a non-entity. It was undeveloped, and it was pretty much exposed to whatever pressures the US wanted to put on it, economic or political. Well, that’s not the case today. The Global South is industrialized. It’s a major player in the world now, and it’s the future major player. And the BRICS could undermine the dollar and the currency and international payment system and so forth. And I think the Trump wing of the capitalists realize that, and they’re trying to orient to the Global South. But to do that, they got to put this Ukraine nonsense to bed, you see. And then they got to pull financially out of Europe, which they’re going to do. And the Europeans, of course, see this, and they’re panicking, right? Because now they got to raise their own industry, their own weapons industry, which is virtually non-existent, especially next generation technology weapons like AI and so forth. Europe’s not even a game when it comes to AI. 90% of all the AI patents are filed by the US and China. So Europe is the backwater of technology right now. It’s the backwater of banking. Its industry development lags the US in a whole number of ways. The US is making Europe a dependency, an economic dependency, not just because of sanctions and blowing up the Nord Stream thing, which made them dependent on US gas and oil, but driving Russia out of the European economy altogether, in which American companies are flooding in the vacuum. But US policies that have to do with taxes, even under Biden, tax policies were passed that’s just sucking money capital out of Europe right now. And on top of that, we got the tariffs now, the tariff policies, right? And on top of that, you’ve got Europe saying, we’re going to remilitarize, we’re going to develop weapons, we’re going to spend $800 billion to develop a weapons industry, which is at the tip of the iceberg, by the way. Germany is going to spend $500 billion just on infrastructure, who knows how much more for weapons. So we have this massive weapon industrialization going on in Europe. But Europe can’t produce the weapons, at least for another five years. It takes that long to really develop these factories, plus they’re way behind in AI and will remain behind. So what’s all this about? Well, the US is going to pull out of Europe and the NATO bases and that wasted expenditure. But guess what? The Europeans are going to raise bonds and raise money. And where are they going to get the weapons in the meantime? From the US. But they’re going to pay full market price now, you see. That’s the difference. Well, it will make Europe even more dependent on the US economically. This whole war with Russia was really about debilitating the Russian economy and regime change. Well, that didn’t work at all. In fact, quite the opposite happened, but it weakened Europe. And I kind of think that was always the plan B of the United States with this war anyway, make Europe dependent on it, drive Russia out of Europe altogether, not just out of energy, right? And make Europe dependent on US industry and US banks. And that’s happening. That’s happening as we speak. So the US does not have to throw money at Europe anymore, does not want to. It needs to develop its own weapons industry even more. It needs to take care and consolidate the empire in the Western Hemisphere once more. And it needs to orient toward taking care of its lake called the Pacific Ocean, you see. So that’s what’s happening. It’s a restructuring a la 1980s economic restructuring, a la World War II, 1944, Bretton Woods, a la you know, 1917-18. The empire goes through these periodic restructurings. It changes the mix of its economic policies. It forges new political institutions, global. And that’s how you must see what’s going on. Now, the problem in the US is the whole capitalist class is not united around that particular vision. You still got the old guard, the Democrats and a huge bureaucracy that’s blown up after 50 years in the US of the empire neoliberalism, right? They’re fighting back. They don’t want to change anything. They wanted to keep everything the way it is. Well, you’ve got this domestic element of this restructuring, which is, well, we’re going to cut cost the government and we’re going to move it somewhere else. And the Democrats don’t want to do that. They want to keep the, I mean, they are totally blind and terribly led and have no alternative to what’s going on, except no change, keep it the same, keep it the same. And of course, the bureaucracy likes that because the bureaucracy has done quite well. It’s really expanded over the last 40, 50 years. So you got this alliance between the Democrats and the old bureaucracy, and you got Trump, which is more than just MAGA now. They’re all signed of a new coalition there, and they want to change things. And it’s going to be a protracted fight here for some time to come. GR: Jack Rasmus, in terms of this stage of restructuring, having to face new realities in the empire and so on and so forth, I have to also ask about restructuring for whom? I mean, when he was inaugurated, Donald Trump had 13 billionaires in his camp, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Elon Musk is a major player in his team. I remember Michel Chossodovsky talking about how the COVID crisis was the excuse, he says, deliberately planned to engineer a broad economic depression, cancel millions of jobs, impoverish people with the lockdowns, and then appropriate and redistribute the wealth that remains among the wealthy. And according to a 2022 report by Oxfam International, while 263 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty that year, the world’s billionaires saw their collective wealth go up by $12.7 trillion. That’s about 42% what they had during the pandemic. Now, effectively, it’s like the 1929 stock market crash, right? Now, is this new restructuring of the U.S. economy actually being designed specifically for the status of the billionaire class in America in mind? I mean, make sure the Americans know who’s really in charge in this new restructured America, in other words. JR: Well, you know, they certainly benefit from all this, and their interest pushing it means even more money for them. So you can’t separate out the advantages and the benefits that flow to the very rich, the capitalists and the billionaires and the tech, you know, the new leading edge of capitalism. And they lever it, they take advantage of it. And, you know, that’s part of the deal to get it pushed through. You can’t separate out their interests and the whole restructuring because they’re the big beneficiaries of the whole thing. They make money when wars are started and they make money when wars are ended. And that’s what’s going on in Ukraine. You know, all this talk about minerals and everything. And the deal is really about how we’re going to, quote, redevelop what’s left of Ukraine and who’s going to really get that money. Well, it’s going to be the capitalists who get the money. Europe has its pot of money called the Russian assets, 300 billion, right? Well, the U.S. doesn’t have a pot to pay its capitalists to redevelop Ukraine. That’s what this 500 billion is about. Create a pot, right? Some of it will go to, you know, U.S. capitalists who are already deeply entrenched in Ukraine, by the way, and they’ll get that money just as the European capitalists will get some of the Russian money, right? That’s how they make money off of ending wars, just as they make money off of starting them. So I don’t think it’s a question of either war or what came first. You know, the capitalists saying, you know, Peter Thiel and all those guys saying, well, we want you to do this, Trump. It’s a very fluid thing where, you know, certain people for domestic reasons and for economic reasons and for foreign policy reasons sort of come together. Some of the many may not even know of this bigger picture, but, you know, conditions push them along in that direction. You know, as far as the COVID thing, yeah, they made a lot of money. The billionaires made a lot of money. That’s documented. That’s fact. Well, how did they make the money? Well, mostly they made it off of financial assets. Well, how did they get it off of financial assets? Well, the monetary policy was such that it gave them free money. You know, the Fed gave $4 trillion more to bankers and investors. They didn’t need it because this, you know, the COVID thing wasn’t like 2008 where you had the financial system collapse, where they threw $4 trillion to prevent the further collapse. No, no. The banks and the financial system was not in trouble in 2020, but they threw $4 trillion at them anyway. They took advantage of the crisis, you see, and stocks just blew right through the whole COVID thing in the last two years. Stock markets are up, what, 50 to 65 percent just in two years, last two years. So, yeah, these policies benefit, are always benefiting the very wealthy, especially the finance capitalists and the technology companies and the energy companies, these leading edge in the capitalist class. You know, your local real estate guys aren’t big players in all this, but the big capitalists always benefit from this. And yeah, they took advantage. I don’t know if they told Trump, you know, what to do here. You know, it’s kind of hard to make those connections, but you, it’s obvious you’ve got a huge smoking gun. The 2008-09 policies benefited them tremendously. The 2021 policies, in which, by the way, we spent $10 trillion. 2021, 6.7 trillion in fiscal stimulus, another $4 trillion in monetary stimulus, $10 trillion. And what did we get for the economy in the full two years that the economy was open, 22, 23, 24? We barely got 2% GDP growth. So, we threw $10 trillion at the economy to get an average, historical average, GDP growth, which means fiscal and monetary policy are broken in this country. That’s part of the contradictions you see of neoliberalism. They’re just not working anymore, but boy, are they funneling the wealth, both through monetary and fiscal policy, into the hands of the billionaires and all of them below them on the capitalist pyramid. GR: Would you care to comment on the selection of Mark Carney as the new leader of the Liberal Party and, you know, ultimately the new Prime Minister of Canada? I mean, he was a former Goldman Sachs banker and the governor of the Bank of Canada and the governor of Bank of England, and he reportedly directed the Canadian government on how to avoid the effects of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. On the tariffs from Donald Trump, Carney had said the following, I believe. He said that, well, he said he would go with the dollar-for-dollar tariffs and, in fact, aim it at them with the least impact on Canadians. So, do you think this is the best strategy for avoiding or diminishing the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs? JR: Well, I see Carney as put in place there by the finance capitalists, who are not just Canadian finance capitalists, but, you know, finance capitalism just sort of breaches country boundaries, right? They want a normal, quote, normal controlled change in the restructuring of the tariff and external policies. You know, Trudeau was just a big problem. Trudeau was just aggravating the hell out of Trump, and he was a big drag on trying to contain and control the whole process of the restructuring and tariff policy going on. Carney is a person who, you know, will work closely with his finance capitalist cousins in the US and Canada and elsewhere, and they will try to bring some rationale to the whole process of what’s going to happen with tariffs and other policies as well. So, you know, the capitalists see him as the right guy to sort of tame and control the whole process that’s going to happen. Trudeau was just going to aggravate it. He was going to maybe take it out of control, you know, and cause, you know, extreme tit for tat. We saw the same exchange, you know, with Ford and Trump, you know, Ford, the Ontario guy there, saying, oh, we’re going to put tariffs at 25% on your electricity. So Trump just, you know, bumps it up to 50%. You know, he sends a signal to him, you know, you better get this guy out of the picture, right? Let’s talk with Carney and, you know, there’ll be a settlement. There will be some increase in what Canadians are going to have to pay with the tariffs, but it will be controlled. It will be kept in a reasonable range. And that’s what I see Carney as the selection and what his role will be.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $84,000, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. BTC topped $85,000 for the first time in five days earlier in the day before retreating. "Some renewed macro stability is seeing Bitcoin and crypto recover in tandem other risk assets," Strahinja Savic, head of data analytics at crypto advisory FRNT Financial, wrote in a Telegram message to Decrypt. "Lower than expected inflation numbers, perception that geopolitical risk is easing, among other factors, are contributing to an easing of macro anxieties and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin." Savic noted that some Bitcoin bulls had "certainly used the opportunity to buy the dip...contributing to this recovery." Bitcoin's rise came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would vote for a Republican measure that would fund the government. A shutdown might have further unsettled markets already rocked by mounting evidence that the U.S. economy was headed for stagflation, in which growth slumps while prices rise. Risk-on assets of all stripes have been swooning for weeks as the country wrestles with the growing prospect of a trade war instigated by U.S. President Trump's tariffs on its biggest trading partners, controversial government cost-cutting measures and other macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, the University of Michigan Sentiment Consumer Index, a measure of confidence in the economy, fell to its lowest level since 2022. The same survey showed expectations for inflation also increasing to their highest point in more than two years. BTC's rise returned the asset to over its 200-day average just a day after it had fallen below the widely watched measure for the first time in more than six months. The average is a favored indicator among investors to consider Bitcoin's longer-term prospects. Other major crypto assets were trading well into positive territory with Solana and Chainlink recently rising 9% and over 6% from Thursday, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Solana has been buffeted in recent weeks as meme coins which favor the blockchain have plummeted. Ethereum, which has also lost ground in recent weeks, rose more than 3.5%. Major equity indexes closed upward with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumping 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. The S&P had dropped into correction territory the previous day, meaning it had dipped at least 10% from its previous high. Gold, a traditional risk-off asset, which spiked above $3,000 for the first time in its history on Thursday, sank below the threshold on Friday. In a text to Decrypt, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote that the Unversity of Michigan survey had likely pushed "investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge," and noted that BlackRock had resumed Bitcoin purchases with a $25 million investment, "reinforcing institutional confidence." But he warned of "volatility and possible significant corrections ahead."

This week: It’s spring time for Coinbase and on-chain assets. The company is going after its tokenized security white whale. CEO Brian Armstrong and his founders have been wanting to offer tokenized stocks since before the company even went public in 2021. Will they do it this time? Meanwhile: What’s that in the sky? An IPO, a new ETF? Turns out it’s both. Real world wins for Coinbase Things keep falling into place for Coinbase. This week alone, the company saw a lawsuit against it in Vermont dropped and got approval to offer its services in India. Now, onlookers are watching to see if Coinbase will get the green light to offer tokenized securities. It’s something the company has wanted to do since before it went public in 2021. If Coinbase got the OK to tokenize securities, it would be a huge boon for the already growing RWA, or real-world asset, segment. The RWA market aims to bring assets like stocks, bonds, property, or even land on-chain. Sometimes that’s been looked at as gimmicky by traditional finance types. But Wall Street has been working to reduce settlement times for years. What faster way to get there than by bringing some assets on-chain? Currently, BlackRock has dominated the RWA space. Just yesterday its BUIDL fund topped $1 billion worth of assets under management. The fund holds dollar-equivalent assets like cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Next in line is the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, which boasts an AUM of $868 million and grants traders exposure to short duration U.S. Treasuries and reverse repo U.S. Treasuries. In the past month alone, RWAs grew by 18% to $18.3 billion, according to rwa.xyz. RWAs are an interesting, but not at all surprising, counterbalance to the global crypto market—which has dropped 16% in the past month, according to CoinGecko data. As more RWA products come on-chain, it would mean investors could flock to the safety of T-bills without having to off-ramp funds into a traditional brokerage account. But Coinbase doesn’t just want to do this on its home turf. The San Francisco company said in a blog post earlier this week it’s calling for “regulatory frameworks that match the scale of opportunity” in Europe. Perpetual futures are the vast majority of global crypto trading - but there has been no path to launch them in the US...until now. That’s about to change. https://t.co/WCUfDnu6SP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 10, 2025 This week the crypto exchange also launched 24/7 access to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Adding more trading hours for its products is the kind of news that will likely help pad Coinbase’s bottom line. As the company pointed out in its most recent 10-K filing: “Our largest source of cash provided by operations are revenues generated from transaction fees.” And as of the end of 2024, cash generated from operations had ballooned to $2.5 billion. That means that revenue stream has more than doubled from $922 million in 2023. On Friday afternoon, Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker, closed at 183.12, up 3.17% on the day. Up, IPO and away! There’s a growing list of companies rumored to be considering an IPO in 2025, but—look, a flying Bitcoin (and an excuse to talk about this news we missed last week). Last night, crypto exchange Gemini flew a Guinness World Record-breaking “aerial display of a cryptocurrency logo formed by multirotor/drones” in Austin, Texas. What do you think we’ll see first: A buzzing horde of drones snatching their record or an IPO? PROOF OF RECORD pic.twitter.com/0tno2sY1UN — Gemini (@Gemini) March 14, 2025 People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week that the company confidentially filed for an IPO with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. That means Gemini is the first to make the jump from the rumored IPO list—which includes stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto exchanges Bullish, Kraken, and Blockchain.com—into the actual race. If any of the other crypto companies start filing IPO paperwork, it may be a while before investors hear about it because of relaxed Securities and Exchange Commission rules. But relaxed rules are precisely why this year could see an uptick in public offerings, according to a recent Law360 column. Wen buy Bitcoin? It was another bye week for Michael Saylor's Bitcoin amassing Strategy. The company, which recently changed its name from MicroStrategy and trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, has seen its Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged at 499,096 Bitcoin since Feb. 24. At the time, the company said that it had purchased Bitcoin for an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin. Bettors, however, are optimistic the company will announce another buy over the weekend. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD believe Strategy will confirm a new Bitcoin purchase on Monday, estimating a 76% chance that the firm’s holdings do not remain unchanged for a third consecutive week. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) On Friday afternoon, Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, closed at 297.49, up a whopping 13% today. Other keys Asset manager Rex Shares is nothing if not creative. On Friday, the company launched an ETF to bring Startegy’s Bitcoin-backed bond offering to the everyman. “Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.” Earlier in the week, Rex and Osprey Funds applied to offer an ETF that would track the price of MOVE, the Movement Network token that launched in November. It’s also the same firm that filed to offer ETFs linked to Official Trump (TRUMP), BONK, and Dogecoin. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Coming After SEC Lawsuit Ends, Predicts Expert

Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has stoked fresh speculation around potential altcoin-focused ETFs for XRP and Solana by BlackRock. In a series of comments posted today on X, Geraci asserted his belief that the world’s largest asset manager will eventually add both crypto assets to its growing portfolio of exchange-traded funds. “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” Geraci wrote, adding that he believes, “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” He elaborated on BlackRock’s motivations, noting: “BlackRock is currently the leader by assets in both bitcoin & ether ETFs… I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s prediction marks a significant shift from BlackRock’s previously stated position on expanding its cryptocurrency ETF lineup. In July last year, Samara Cohen, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no plans to launch ETFs other than Bitcoin and Ethereum in the near future. Several months later, in December, Jay Jacobs—BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs—clarified that the $10 trillion asset manager was primarily focused on its existing crypto offerings, indicating that altcoin-based ETFs were not on the company’s immediate roadmap. Despite BlackRock’s earlier reservations, industry analysts have highlighted growing demand for altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs), including those tracking Solana and XRP. In January, banking giant JPMorgan released projections in January suggesting that a green light for these ETPs could trigger inflows of up to $14 billion in their first year alone. According to the report, Solana-related ETPs could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in assets within 6 to 12 months, while XRP-based products could garner between $4 billion and $8 billion over the same timeframe—assuming a favorable regulatory environment. As of March 13, 2025, nine issuers have submitted their respective applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP-centric ETF products. These include Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, ProShares, Grayscale, CoinShares, Volatility Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Both ProShares and Volatility Shares have also proposed multiple variants—including short and leveraged ETFs—indicating a concerted push to provide a broad spectrum of trading strategies for investors. Central to Geraci’s prediction is the resolution of the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The asset’s regulatory status has been under scrutiny, and many market observers believe that a definitive outcome would pave the way for major financial institutions—like BlackRock—to feel comfortable launching any new crypto-focused investment vehicles. At press time, XRP traded at $2.31. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Print This week, BlackRock, one of the largest U.S. asset management firms, signed an agreement with CK Hutchison Holdings to acquire 90% of Panama Ports Company, which operates the crucial Balboa and Cristobal ports. The acquisition comes amid U.S. concerns that the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison could create a strategic foothold for China in the Panama Canal. The deal also addresses some of the U.S.’s strategic anxieties for now, yet the implications extend beyond the Canal’s waters.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Apple sells four kinds of iPad: the iPad Pro; the iPad Air; the iPad mini; and the standard, cheapest iPad. In this roundup, we’ve got all the best deals on Apple’s cheapest iPad, which is currently the iPad A16 model introduced in March 2025. The 2025 A16 iPad is the 11th-generation model, replacing the 2022 iPad (10th generation) which ran on an A14 chip. The main selling point of the 2025 iPad is that it has double the storage at the entry level, so it’s a better deal than ever. The processor has leapt from the A14 to A16, which might sound good, but this is also the main disadvantage of the 2025 iPad. The A16 is not compatible with Apple Intelligence, the new AI features Apple is making quite a fuss about. It is already possible to get small savings off the price of the A16 iPad, which went on sale on March 12, or you can save money on an older iPad, which isn’t all that different to the new one. Just beware that the older model had half the storage for the same price, so the deal will have to take that into account to be worth it. For that reason we will be clear about what the newer model would cost when listing the deals on the older model below. We’ve checked all the best places to pick up the iPad at the best price for you so that you can get a bargain. If you’d like to see the best prices for the standard iPad’s more expensive siblings, including iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad Pro, click those links for dedicated deals roundups. Also, have a look at our iPad buying buide if you’re not sure which model you want. You may also like to read our best iPad for kids, best iPad for students, and best iPad for seniors guides. You can also check out our roundup of the best Apple deals. The main difference between the 2025 iPad and the 2022 iPad is that you will get more storage for your money with the newer models. The entry-level 2022 iPad had 64GB storage, while the 2025 iPad has double that storage for the same price. So is is crucial to keep that in mind if you are considering buying a 10th-gen iPad, or you risk spending more on an older iPad. U.S. U.K. Check below to see other deals that are available. Below you will find the the best prices at various resellers. Discontinued iPads You may find older iPads on sale, just make sure you compare the price to that of the 2025 iPad. The 10th-gen iPad, with its larger 10.9-inch display, launched in October 2022. U.S. retailers U.K. retailers Apple has a number of Apple Premium Resellers who stock iPads in the U.K., and also offer other services, try the following: If you want to buy the iPad on contract you could try these networks: U.S. network carriers U.K. network carriers The deals you will see above are generally from Apple resellers rather than Apple itself, which very rarely drops the prices. Apple does, however, sell reconditioned iPads in its refurbished store. So you might be able to grab a bargain. The iPads in Apple’s refurbished store may be ex-display stock, or they may have been returned to Apple due to a fault, but they are fully reconditioned now and come with a full year’s warranty. It’s not like buying secondhand. The U.S. refurbished store has a selection that includes: Compared to the original price, you can save as much as $320 on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. In the U.K. you’ll find a similar selection of iPads available from Apple’s refurbished store. You’ll find the following: There are savings of £480 on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compared to the original price. Another place to look is BackMarket US and BackMarket UK, which sells refurbished Macs and other Apple products. Amazon also has a certified refurbished store for Apple products, but we would advise against buying any products that are older than five years. Most of the products we see on the Amazon refurbished store are unfortunately very old. There is a large refurbished market for the iPad. We’d recommend taking a look at these refurbished resellers for iPad offers: Karen has worked on both sides of the Apple divide, clocking up a number of years at Apple's PR agency prior to joining Macworld more than two decades ago.

March 14, 2025 12:55 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) – China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) reposted a commentary criticizing CK Hutchison‘s port deal with U.S. firm BlackRock as a betrayal of China, sending shares of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate sharply lower on Friday. The repost of the critical state media commentary by China’s governing body overseeing the territory highlights the complex geopolitical pressures the firm faces, as investors worry the deal could be derailed without Beijing’s backing. CK Hutchison said last week it agreed to sell most of the global $22.8 billion ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the waterway to be removed from what he says is Chinese ownership, has hailed the deal. On Thursday, the Ta Kung Pao newspaper based in Hong Kong published a commentary saying the deal “betrays and sells out the whole of Chinese people,” neglects national interests and shows CK Hutchison is profit-seeking. The commentary, reposted on HKMAO’s website, said the U.S. would constrain China’s maritime trade and Chinese companies would face great risks in logistics and supply chains, impacting China’s Belt and Road initiatives. “This deal is an act of hegemony by the U.S., which uses its state power to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through despicable means such as coercion, pressure, and inducement,” the commentary wrote. “It is power politics packaged as a ‘business behavior’.” CK Hutchison and the HKMAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of CK Hutchison closed down 6.4%, underperforming a rise of 2.1% in the benchmark Heng Sang Index .HSI. A Hong Kong-founded and -listed firm owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison has said its business operations are independent from China. Hong Kong’s edge as an international financial center is expected to erode further as it gets squeezed by geopolitical tensions, executives and analysts said. Some shipping companies are moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry, Reuters reported. Trump, meanwhile, is planning an executive order to charge fees for China-linked vessels at U.S. ports, in a bid to resuscitate American shipbuilding and disrupt China’s supply chains. Vera Yuen, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong’s business school, said the commentary was a “manifestation of political risks and a cautionary lesson for companies that want to do business with both sides. “You cannot do both at the same time,” she said. This is not the first time billionaire Li has been in Beijing’s crosshairs. In 2015, Chinese media commentaries criticized him for abandoning China by extensively selling his assets at a time of economic tension in the country. While CK Hutchison agreed to negotiations with the BlackRock consortium on an exclusive basis for 145 days according to a statement, the deal has not been finalized yet. “The risk of the deal has increased,” said Thomas Kwok, head of equity business of CHIEF Securities. “CKH is now caught in the middle; if it doesn’t sell, it would continue to be bothered by the U.S.; but if it sells it would upset Beijing.” “We need to watch where this will lead CKH to now; if it would go through litigation to keep the Panama port, or they will need to communicate with Beijing.” (Reporting by Clare Jim and James Pomfret; Editing by Stephen Coates and Clarence Fernandez) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: 'Disrupt and Leapfrog': Intel's New CEO Charts a (Risky) Comeback Strategy

Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is signaling he’s ready to take bold steps to revitalize the US chipmaker’s business and reclaim its competitive edge. “In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog,” he wrote in a letter to employees that was made public. The letter offers a glimpse of how Tan, the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, will lead Intel when it faces intense competition from Apple, AMD, and Nvidia, which use Taiwan’s TSMC to build cutting-edge chips. In naming Tan CEO, Intel’s board cited "his proven track record of creating shareholder value"—which can be a worrying sign for PC builders and technologists more concerned about the company’s chip prowess than its financials. But in his letter to employees, Tan said, "Under my leadership, Intel will be an engineering-focused company." "We will push ourselves to develop the best products, listen intently to our customers, and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we make so that we build trust,” he added. In terms of strategy, Tan says he’ll push Intel to “double down” on areas where the company already excels. In areas where it's behind, Tan will try to boldly leapfrog. "And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace." One of Tan's chief goals is to "establish ourselves as a world-class foundry," which indicates that he plans to keep Intel’s chip foundry business rather than spin it off. In 2021, the company made another bold bet by expanding into the foundry business under previous CEO Pat Gelsinger, who sought to compete directly with TSMC in contract semiconductor manufacturing. However, the endeavor is costing Intel tens of billions of dollars. An Ohio factory has also been delayed to the early 2030s. Meanwhile, TSMC is preparing to spend $165 billion to build six new fabs in Arizona. For now, Intel appears to be bullish on its upcoming 18A manufacturing process, which will start producing cutting-edge PC chips in the second half of this year. Both Intel and clients—including Microsoft, Amazon, and Arm—have signed up to use the 18A process. Although Tan’s letter is meant to rally the troops, industry watchers also expect layoffs. Before becoming CEO, Tan was an Intel board member for two years. But in August, he abruptly resigned over disagreements with Gelsinger. This included Tan demanding deeper cuts to Intel’s “bloated workforce” and bureaucracy, according to Reuters. Gelsinger initiated layoffs, but only to 15% of the company’s employee base.

Title: Bitcoin outperforms tech stocks as US market opens to sea of green

Bitcoin's strength persists as tech stocks surge and dollar weakens. The US stock market has opened to a sea of green on seemingly minor news. While President Trump’s call to Vladamir Putin to end the war in Ukraine could be seen as a potential ease to global tensions, the market appears to be responding primarily to a lack of trade war advancements. Markets love certainty and direction, with tariff volatility coming out of the US, Europe, and Canada; this Friday, traders seem optimistic that a reprieve is coming. The DXY dropped just 0.08% moments ago, which is correlated with Bitcoin’s decline of almost 1%. However, Bitcoin has held firm over the last day, outperforming the US market. Against a weakening US dollar, down 0.12% over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin’s relative strength is accentuated by a roughly 2% gain. It is significantly surpassing the Nasdaq, which is up 0.61% over the same timeframe. Yet Bitcoin remains range-bound, with prices fluctuating within a channel between $79,000 and $84,000. Tech equities broadly rallied at the market open, led by Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which gained 6.32%, and NVIDIA (NVDA), which went up 3.33%. Yet Bitcoin-linked investment vehicles, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), showed a parallel upward trajectory, reflecting broader investor interest in digital assets. Bitcoin’s positive divergence amid a mixed economic backdrop, characterized by modest dollar weakness and tech equity strength, indicates sustained market demand.

Title: Trump's breaking point could come soon, analyst tells BI

Good morning. Have you ever had a paintball gun let loose on your vehicle? No? You must not own a Cybertruck then. BI spoke with 10 Cybertruck owners about what it's like driving the most controversial vehicle in the world. In today's big story, we're looking at when the stock market sell-off could force President Donald Trump to drop his trade war. What's on deck Markets: Ross Gerber predicted Tesla's stock crash. Now he's doubling down. Tech: After 10 weeks of Amazon's full RTO, some employees feel energized. Others quit. Business: State and local governments across the US are looking to adopt their own DOGE. But first, when is enough, enough? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. When will the losses become too steep to ignore? It could be soon. Trump's unflinching pursuit of his protectionist agenda has come at a cost: The S&P 500 officially entered a correction on Thursday, down 10% from its February peak. So far, Trump's team has shown that they're willing to tolerate stock market pain — but at some point, that pain may become unbearable. Marko Papic, the chief strategist at BCA Research, thinks Trump might not be far away from his breaking point. He said a 15% to 20% decline in the S&P 500 could force the president to start walking back his trade war. Economist Desmond Lachman, meanwhile, says the issue is less about a specific drop and more about how quickly and severely the sell-off unfolds: "What's occurred over the last couple of weeks, if that continues at this kind of pace, he'll have to cave." As BI's William Edwards writes, with top earners propping up consumer spending, a significant stock market decline could start to weigh on their willingness to open their wallets. Investors can blame the trade war. The latest development came on Thursday when Trump threatened a 200% tariff on wine and other alcohol products coming from the EU — a retaliatory measure against the EU's new tariffs on $28.4 billion worth of US goods that included a quintessential American drink: whiskey. Businesses, from wine shops to restaurants, are now on the rocks. One couple who run an Italian-Croatian restaurant told BI that they're alarmed: "How does an Italian restaurant pivot away from European wine?" 1. An early Tesla investor-turned-bear doubles down. In late February, Ross Gerber predicted Tesla stock would drop 50% this year. Since then, the stock has tanked. BI followed up, and Gerber doesn't think a rebound is on the horizon. 2. The S&P 500 is officially in a correction, and all signs point to the trade war. The prevailing view is that President Trump's tariffs have rocked investor confidence and triggered recession alarm bells. Following the announcement of a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, the S&P 500 finished Thursday 10% down from last month's peak. 3. But JPMorgan thinks the worst is over. The bank thinks a corner of the hedge fund sector — not recession fears — may be to blame for the market's recent weakness. Now that equity quant funds have reduced their positions, the worst of the correction may be over, it said in a recent note. 1. Checking in on Amazon's RTO rollout. It's been 10 weeks since the tech giant instituted its five-day return-to-office mandate. Eleven employees told us how they're doing — including two who quit. 2. Did Apple bite off more than it can chew? The tech giant doesn't tend to overpromise and underdeliver, but some onlookers are noticing a shift. Apple teased some glitzy AI features back in June, but they haven't come to fruition. BI's Peter Kafka broke down Apple's game of catch-up. 3. Meta is trying to silence a former executive. She told BI why. Sarah Wynn-Williams made headlines this week when she released her explosive memoir detailing her time at Meta. BI sat down with the "Careless People" author hours before an arbitrator ruled in Meta's favor, barring Wynn-Williams from promoting it. 1. Little DOGEs everywhere. Republican and libertarian leaders in at least 18 states are copying Elon Musk's slash-and-burn playbook. They've even adopted quirky names, too. (Hello, GOAT and FLOGE.) Meanwhile, the OG DOGE is hiring more staff to pore over death records in search of benefits fraud. 2. Would you rather: PIP or severance? That's the choice some TikTok staffers face after receiving low-performance review scores. Three current employees told BI they thought accepting a performance improvement plan over severance was rare because it's challenging to survive one. 3. You may be footing Big Tech's electricity bill. Companies building data centers are striking secretive electricity deals with utilities, potentially raising the average American's bills, Harvard researchers found. But it's hard to know the exact price tag when the contracts are hidden from the public. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: New AI models are running on just one or two chips. Will they trigger another DeepSeek moment for Nvidia?

A new generation of AI models is squeezing more power out of fewer chips. Whether they spark another DeepSeek-scale panic for Nvidia is another matter. Google led the charge this week with a collection of smaller models — Gemma 3 — that appear to pack a serious punch with a standout feat: they run smoothly with just a single Nvidia chip, known as a GPU. Unveiling the models Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted their efficiency in an X post, writing that "you'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models." Cohere, a Toronto-headquartered startup led by former Googler Aidan Gomez, also released a new model on Thursday called Command A, which is described as a "state-of-the-art" model that runs on just two GPUs. (Business Insider, alongside other publishers, has sued Cohere over copyright infringement.) One of the key lessons DeepSeek imparted to the world when it released an AI model in January was the ability to do more with less. The Chinese startup said its R1 model was competitive with OpenAI's o1 model while claiming it needed fewer chips. The claim triggered the biggest single-day wipeout in US stock market history, in which Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in value. The market wondered if more efficient AI would reduce demand for Nvidia chips — demand that helped it achieve a record full-year revenue in 2024 of $130.5 billion. At first glance, this new wave of AI models seems to pose an even greater threat, as they claim to be state-of-the-art while only needing a handful of GPUs to run. A chart of Gemma's performance on the industry leaderboard Chatbot Arena, for instance — shared by Pichai — showed the model outperformed those from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta while being run on fewer GPUs. Gemma 3 is here! Our new open models are incredibly efficient - the largest 27B model runs on just one H100 GPU. You'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/4FKujOROQ4 But just because more companies are learning to squeeze more performance from their AI with fewer chips, it's not a given that these more efficient models will go on to pose a DeepSeek-style risk to Nvidia. For one, as the DeepSeek saga unfolded, tech CEOs were quick to note a phenomenon known as Jevons Paradox. The economic principle suggests that as technology becomes more efficient, consumption of that technology will increase — not decrease. It might help explain why Google itself has said it plans to increase its AI-related capital expenditure this year to $75 billion, which typically includes the GPUs housed in the data centers critical for AI. Google has been one of the main buyers of the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs — the Blackwell chips introduced last year — so it's plausible to expect them to be among those ready to spend on the new GPU Nvidia is expected to unveil at its GTC event next week. So far, the market does not appear to be worried by the latest chip efficiency developments — Nvidia's share price is up about 6% since Tuesday. There is a small caveat to this. While Google's new Gemma models can use a single Nvidia GPU to run on, it appears the training of the new models took place with Google's own chips, known as tensor processing units, or TPUs. Tech giants like Google have spent years working on their own silicon as a means of reducing their dependence on Nvidia, so Gemma poses a curious situation in which Google has produced a competitive AI model without using any Nvidia GPUs for training. Still, it's unlikely that a company like Google will reduce its dependence on Nvidia GPUs in a significant way anytime soon — and for a simple reason. The company's push to produce more efficient models is happening alongside its development of more powerful, large-scale Gemini AI models that aim to push the boundaries of intelligence. These models' success, for now, depends on getting access to as much compute as possible. This approach was recently validated by the release of Grok 3, the latest frontier AI model from Elon Musk's startup. Its release came with a note that said a future version of the model would be trained on a larger, 200,000 GPU cluster. The future of AI development, then, looks like one in which two different paths emerge in tandem: one in which smaller, more efficient models emerge that run on fewer GPUs, and another in which large-scale models continue to have as many GPUs thrown at them as possible.

Title: Can Adobe Stock Fall To $200?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. ADBE Stock Adobe (NASDAQ; ADBE) recently announced its fiscal first quarter results for the period ending February 2025, reporting earnings of $5.08 per share on revenues of $5.71 billion. This represents a 10% year-over-year increase in sales and 13% growth in earnings. The company fared better than the Wall Street expectations, which had projected earnings of $4.97 per share on sales of $5.66 billion. Separately, in an uncertain environment, will drug stocks be defensive? See Should You Buy Pfizer Stock At $26? Despite exceeding analyst estimates, Adobe’s stock plunged 14% on Thursday, March 13. This can partly be attributed to an underwhelming outlook for the current quarter. Adobe projects $4.98 earnings per share on sales of $5.8 billion (at the mid-point of the guidance), slightly missing the consensus estimates of $5.00 earnings per share on sales of $5.8 billion. The company’s remaining performance obligations—a key indicator of future business—grew by 12% to $19.7 billion. Lately, investors have been worried about slower than expected growth in generative AI for Adobe. The company reported $125 million in AI annualized recurring revenue and forecasts that number to double within the current fiscal year. Beyond the impact of earnings, this is a concerning period for the broader markets, which creates additional challenges for Adobe. The growing economic concerns in the United States, sparked by President Trump’s implementation of tariffs, are fostering an unfavorable climate for markets in general. Adobe stock is unlikely to remain immune to these conditions. In fact, we think that ADBE stock could decline to as low as $200 per share. Here’s the thing, in a downturn, ADBE can lose – no – there is evidence, from the recent economic downturns, that ADBE stock lost as much as 65% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio – and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. While the continued growth in Adobe’s subscription business is commendable, substantial macroeconomic headwinds warrant attention. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead. The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration's bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex. Notably, ADBE stock has seen an impact worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns —a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today’s volatile environment. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • ADBE stock fell 51.2% from a high of $564.37 on 3 January 2022 to $275.20 on 2 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 September 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $634.76 on 4 February 2024 and currently trades at around $380 • ADBE stock fell 25.6% from a high of $383.28 on 19 February 2020 to $285.00 on 12 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 May 2020 • ADBE stock fell 66.7% from a high of $48.00 on 24 October 2007 to $15.98 on 3 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 12 July 2013 Adobe’s stock has declined 15% year-to-date, reflecting investor concerns about the company’s position in the generative AI space. This downward trend could potentially continue with the macroeconomic uncertainty. Surely, Adobe has demonstrated strong revenue growth, averaging 10.9% over the past three years—outpacing the S&P 500's 6.3% growth rate during the same period. However, the stock continues to command a premium valuation with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.0, substantially higher than the S&P 500's P/S ratio of 3.2. So ask yourself the question: if you want to hold on to your ADBE stock, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $250 or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is not always easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset – a Boston area wealth manager, whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during 2008/2009 timeframe, when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Bitcoin and crypto prices are struggling to regain momentum after a steep sell-off over the last month (not helped by a serious BlackRock chief executive warning). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has bounced around $80,000 per bitcoin after falling in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s executive order that called for the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve but fell short of market expectations and put bitcoin on the verge of a major price crash. Now, as China quietly primes the bitcoin price for a huge earthquake, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump’s top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve, with a White ... [+] House leak revealing he could be planning to buy huge swathes of bitcoin—something that would likely send the bitcoin price sharply higher. Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential working group on digital assets, told attendees of a closed-door round table hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute that the White House plans to buy as much bitcoin as it can, crypto news outlet Decrypt reported, citing multiple anonymous sources. A White House official confirmed Hines’ comments to Decrypt, adding any such acquisitions would be made "in a budget neutral way that doesn’t cost the taxpayers a dime." The private meeting was reportedly attended by U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) as well as Strategy founder Michael Saylor, bitcoin miner Marathon Digital chief executive Fred Thiel, Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley, and the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc David Bailey. Lummis this week reintroduced legislation that would see the U.S. buy up to one million bitcoin over five years, enshrining into law the strategic bitcoin reserve created by Trump via executive order earlier this month. Trump’s executive order creating the bitcoin reserve was met with a bitcoin price sell-off due to its lack of commitment to buying additional bitcoin. This U.S. currently holds around 200,000 bitcoin, accumulated via civil and criminal forfeitures. However, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and its broader crypto stockpile of other digital assets. “Disappointment over the U.S. government’s strategic bitcoin reserve, formed from seized assets rather than immediate additional purchases, has also weighed on sentiment,” Tagus Capital analysts wrote in an emailed note. “However, concerns over the strategic bitcoin reserve may be overdone, with the potential for budget-neutral future purchases by the U.S. government and an acceleration of other nations adopting bitcoin as strategic reserves.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen back from its all-time high, reached in the aftermath of Donald Trump's ... [+] November election victory. Despite the bitcoin price plummeting in recent weeks, bitcoin and crypto market watchers have been talking up recent developments in the U.S. and abroad, predicting the dip is temporary. “Despite considerable market headwinds, the crypto industry has witnessed several groundbreaking developments, namely: the establishment of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve; the establishment of a U.S. digital asset stockpile; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s authorization for banks to engage in crypto assets; the recognition of stablecoins and real-world assets; and here in Europe the introduction of the E.U.’s MiCA regulations,” Brett Reeves, head of European sales at crypto infrastructure provider BitGo, said in emailed comments. "These advancements, which seemed aspirational merely a year ago, reflect a rapidly evolving landscape where digital assets are becoming integral to the global financial system. So whilst prices may be crashing for now, we must remember how far we've come in a short space in time and just how much potential this space has in the years ahead."

Editor Activism Activist Post, Neenah Payne From 2020-2023, the US government and corporate media told Americans to “Follow the science”. They assured us that the unprecedented COVID policies were based on a “scientific consensus”. Anyone – even top doctors and scientists — who questioned those policies was ridiculed as a “conspiracy theorist” and “anti-vaxxer”. However, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya Confirmed As NIH Director shows how destructive and unscientific those rushed policies were. Yet, the government and corporate media continue to ignore the devastating consequences – the astronomical deaths and injuries – caused by those policies. Now, the documentary Follow The Silenced tells the story of those injured by the COVID shots. Experience Follow the Silenced, a groundbreaking documentary that goes beyond personal stories to expose the deeper systemic challenges faced by the injured.

Anyone who refused to get the shots was ridiculed as a “selfish anti-vaxxer” who was “killing grandma”. Rachel Maddow said people who got the shots could not pass COVID to anyone else. However, the tide has turned now. Viewers demand apology from MSNBC, Rachel Maddow for previous COVID vaccine comments. Why War On Unvaccinated Is So Dangerous For Everyone Don Lemon ridiculed people who didn’t get the shots. Don Lemon argues it’s time to ‘shun’ anti-vaxxersCNN’s Don Lemon On The Unvaccinated: ‘Their Behavior Is Idiotic And Nonsensical’ King of Clowns Don Lemon says unvaxxed people should be banned from going to buy food “CNN talking head Don Lemon says we “shouldn’t waste our breath” on unvaccinated people, so instead of talking to them as rational human beings with dignity and personal freedom, we should ban anyone who hasn’t gotten the ‘Rona vaccine from the grocery store (and employment). I’m sure a lot of people are not gonna agree with this, but [you] don’t get the vaccine, you can’t go to the supermarket. You don’t have the vaccine? You can’t go to the ball game. Don’t have the vaccine? Can’t go to work. Don’t have the vaccine? Can’t come here. No shirt, no shoes, no service.” Ah, yes. An emergency authorized vaccine for a virus that is insanely survivable for healthy people is the exact same as the moral argument against walking in butt naked to a store. It’s also okay that half of America starves based on this premise.” If Lemon’s comments had been said about ANY other group, they would be banned as hate speech and incitement to violence. CNN’s Don Lemon has lowest-rated week since struggling program switched names shows that Lemon is struggling to maintain an audience. So, these comments may have been an attempt to get publicity. Government and Corporate Media Continue To Ignore Evidence The government and corporate media have continued to ignore and deny the evidence that the COVID shots caused massive deaths and serious injuries. LONG COVID OR VACCINE INJURY? SPIKE PROTEIN FOUND IN THE VACCINATED 2 YEARS LATERWith the NIH showing little concern to study long COVID despite pouring $1 billion into research, a new bombshell study on patients with a debilitating post-vaccination syndrome is showing elevated spike protein levels over 2 years (the time of study) after vaccination. FOLLOW THE SILENCED: EXPOSING THE COVER-UP OF COVID-19 VACCINE INJURIES COVID Shots Are Killing Large Numbers of People World Renowned Conventional Doc Blasts The COVID JAB-Erwocks links to an interview with Dr. Peter McCullough, Vice Chief of Internal Medicine, Baylor University Medical Center. The article says Dr. McCullough “might be the world’s top cardiologist, who also holds an MPH degree and is a professor of medicine. His work/background is totally stunning, and seems impossible for one person. …Even better, he’s also world famous. Meaning…he has the exceptional intelligence to analyze and dissect the COVID VAX atrocity. The measured way in which he delivers this bombshell is also remarkable.” Dr. McCullough discusses the blood clots for which the J&J product was halted and points out that the blood clots caused by the mRNA vaccine are “probably 30 times that” — but it has not been halted. Dr. McCullough says “…keep in mind that the NIH is a co-owner of the Moderna patent.” Excess Mortality Just Got Worse: Alarming New Data! Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that when former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd discussed shocking information about excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history,” Dowd stated. Dowd noted an acceleration of excess mortality in 2021, around the time when mandates and boosters took effect. Dowd said “starting in the summer and into the Fall, with the mandates and the boosters, there were 61,000 excess millennial deaths. Basically, millennials experienced a Vietnam War in the second half of 2021.” National Archives stated 58,220 U.S. military fatal casualties of the Vietnam War. Dowd says this data is the smoking gun which shows COVID-19 injections are causing excess mortality in all age groups. Dowd labeled this ‘democide.’ Wikipedia’s definition of democide: “Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder”. Dowd summarized: “So the government, through the mandates, has killed people.” TFH #603: 9/11 And The Deagel Report With Charlie Robinson reported that Dr. Bill Deagle predicted in 2017 that the populations in Western countries would drop by 2025 because of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Robinson correlated those predictions with the “excess deaths” in 2021-2022 in Western countries that took the COVID shots. He pointed out that countries that did not get many COVID shots are ones for which Deagle predicted population rises. So, Dr. Deagle knew by 2017 there was a plan to release a deadly “pandemic” to kill much of the Western population by 2025. Charlie Robinson, host of MagroAggressions explains in the video below that the deaths predicted years ago by Dr. Bill Deagle correspond to the deaths of countries that got the most COVID shots. Robinson is the author of Hypocrazy: Surviving In A World Of Cultural Double Standards (2021) and The Octopus of Global Control in 2017. He is co-author of The Controlled Demolition of the American Empire.Part 1: Where did all the people go? From Macroaggressions with Charlie RobinsonA scary look at what the future may hold as the jabbed continue to die.Part 2: Where did all the people go? From Macroaggressions with Charlie Robinson First published on 5/13/22 The COVID shots were not necessary. The CDC stats showed in early 2020 that COVID was little threat toa anyone unless they were old and/or had several serious illnesses. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (1984-20220 published an article on 3/26/20 in the New England Journal of Medicine called Covid-19 – Navigating the Uncharted. It was co-authored by Dr. H. Clifford Lane, M.D., NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects and by Dr. Robert Redfield of the CDC. The article said “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a fatality rate of approximately 0.1)…rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively”. However, when Dr. Fauci served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, he endorsed COVID shots for pregnant women and babies as young as six months old. Yet, several inexpensive outpatient treatments for COVID were known in early 2020 — including HCQ, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Ivermectin, and Budesonide. The Emergency Use Authorizations for the COVID shots illegal because EUAs can be issued only if no treatments are available. Dr. Fauci declared “I represent science”. So, anyone who questioned the COVID “consensus” was questioning “science”. Fauci under fire: Declares “I represent science” 11/20/21 With his Sunday retort “What happened on January 6th, Senator?” it appears to critics that Dr. Anthony Fauci has openly expressed what many of them suspected – that he is a partisan political player. Fauci’s comment was made in response to Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s tweet that Fauci should face prosecution for denying under oath that the U.S. helped fund gain of function research at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. However, during the Congressional hearing on 6/4/22, Dr. Fauci admitted there was no scientific basis for many COVID policies – including wearing masks and social distancing which was used to justify the devastating lockdowns. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Hearing Reveals Dr. Fauci Made Mitigation Decisions Without Factual Evidence Fauci says no evidence for pandemic guidance on masking or social distancing. The New York Times Magazine: Dr. Fauci Looks Back” ‘Something Clearly Went Wrong’ shows that Fauci admits there were serious problems with the COVID policies he forced on the nation. President Joe Biden pardoned Fauci. President Biden pre-emptively pardoned Fauci back to 2014 when he reportedly authorized illegal gain of function research.

Under the new Donald Trump administration, crypto-friendly policies have fueled a surge in ETF filings beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Earlier this week, Franklin Templeton became the largest asset manager to seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the price of XRP, the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. Despite multiple issuers filing with the SEC to launch spot XRP funds, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and Bitcoin and Ether ETF issuer, has avoided the Ripple-promoted token. Notably, BlackRock’s spot BTC and ETH ETFs have both experienced billions in inflows during the last year. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust ETF, IBIT, eventually matured enough to surpass its gold ETF in assets under management. ETF Store president Nate Geraci believes the asset management behemoth will only file for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) once the SEC’s four-year-long lawsuit against Ripple is concluded. The prolonged battle since December 2020 over allegations of unregistered XRP sales may be over soon. The July 2023 ruling by District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, declaring XRP a non-security when sold to retail investors, but fining Ripple $125 million for institutional sales marked a turning point. Recent reports indicate the legal spat between the two parties could soon reach a conclusion, with Ripple negotiating better terms as the regulator adopts a more lenient regulatory stance under acting Chair Mark Uyeda. One final issue reportedly being discussed is a comparison between XRP and Ether. At the core is whether XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more of a commodity than a security. Geraci has also predicted that BlackRock’s Solana ETF could be filed with the SEC any day from now. He doesn’t think the $10 trillion asset manager will simply allow rivals to introduce ETFs baked on the XRP and SOL “without any sort of fight.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has previously penciled in a 65% and 70% chance that XRP ETFs and SOL ETFs, respectively, secure a green light this year. However, he did not forecast the timing. Issuers must still contend with regulatory review, lawsuits, and public comment on the pending applications.

Title: BlackRock, other investors to pump another $15 million into debt-ridden Razor Group

Investors including BlackRock Inc. have agreed to provide another loan of at least $15 million to Razor Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as the German e-commerce brand aggregator attempts to stave off a liquidity crunch. The relatively modest financing proposal indicates the severity of the cash squeeze at the Berlin-based firm that, according to Pitchbook data, has raised more than $1.3 billion in capital. It’s part of a turnaround effort that includes talks between Razor and fellow aggregator Infinite Commerce Inc. for a potential merger, the people said, asking not to identified because the process is confidential. A total of $30 million in bridge financing has been granted to Razor over recent months by lenders such as Victory Park Capital Advisors as well as equity investors including Christian Angermayer’s Presight Capital, the people added. The company is also working on a potential fundraising with existing shareholders, according to emails sent to investors in late February and seen by Bloomberg News. Communications show that Razor investors were contemplating a financing of at least $75 million alongside the M&A deal. Spokespeople for Razor, BlackRock and Presight Capital declined to comment on the proposed turnaround. Spokespeople for Victory Park and Infinite Commerce didn’t respond to requests for comment. So-called Amazon aggregators buy up firms that sell products via online platforms, with the aim of saving costs on logistics and marketing by bundling brands under one roof. The boom in e-commerce during the pandemic encouraged investors to bet billions on these businesses, but falling consumer demand since the end of lockdown has seen a wave of restructuring across the sector — to the detriment of their investors. One of their main strategies for plugging holes in these aggregators’ balance sheets has been masterminding consolidation between the e-commerce conglomerates themselves. Infinite Commerce, the potential merger partner, is itself a combination of four brand aggregators that were merged with the help of Victory Park last year. Razor Group also acquired Perch — another BlackRock investment in the aggregator sector — last year. BlackRock and Victory Park joined Razor’s roster of lenders in May 2021, according to a statement at the time. However, the investment has since soured with a BlackRock middle-market private credit fund downgraded to junk last week, in part due to “credit challenges” stemming from brand aggregators. That included a $50.3 million unrealized loss on Razor as of Dec. 31. The publicly traded fund, BlackRock TCP Capital Corp., will “avoid meaningful concentrations in any one industry subsector, such as Amazon aggregators,” Chief Executive Officer Phil Tseng said on a Feb. 27 earnings call. The industry consolidation is fraught with tension between equity holders — who don’t want to take complete losses on their investments — and creditors, who are usually first to be paid in a liquidation but know they’ll only get pennies on the dollar. The hope is that with further acquisitions, Razor can aim for an initial public offering and offer something in return for all investors. Razor ran into issues with inventory, according to the emails from late last month. A delay in closing the purchase of Perch as well as liquidity constraints led to a pause in new orders, leading to periods when products were out of stock. Supply-chain issues also contributed to difficulties replenishing stock later, the messages show. This pressure on earnings eventually led Razor to breach the debt terms of a working capital facility, which then prompted Razor’s other lenders to allege a default on their own financing, according to the emails. This paved the way for discussions over a consensual solution, they show. BlackRock also was involved in the restructuring of SellerX, another German brand aggregator, and agreed to take a stake in the company as part of a debt-for-equity swap, Bloomberg previously reported. Another of its brand aggregator investments, Thrasio, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Panama Canal: China blasts ‘spineless’ sale of ports to BlackRock
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/business/panama-canal-sale-china-criticism-intl-hnk/index.html
Time Published: 2025-03-14T09:55:32Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has sharply criticized a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to American asset management giant BlackRock, attacking the deal as “spineless groveling” and a “betrayal” of the Chinese people. A commentary published by the state-owned Ta Kung Pao newspaper and reposted on the website of China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office on Thursday sent shares in CK Hutchison (CKH), the Hong Kong-based owner of the ports, plummeting by more than 6% on Friday. Observers say it was a sign that some investors are concerned the deal may not ultimately go through, if Beijing objects. “I’m not aware that any approval from Chinese regulators is required given CKH is retaining all of its existing Chinese ports,” Dan Baker, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar, told CNN. “Of course, there is some chance that other influences may be brought to bear on the company that might put the deal at risk. The market seems to be pricing in some chance of this.” CNN has reached out to the conglomerate for comment. Last week, a group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from CK Hutchison. The consortium also agreed to buy CK Hutchison’s controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. They said the deal is an “agreement in principle.” US President Donald Trump said during the lead-up to his inauguration and since taking office that he intended to “take back” the Panama Canal from Panama, which took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. He cited Chinese ownership of some of the port operations as a sign that China was now running the canal. When announced last week, the deal was seen as an expedient way for CK Hutchison — a global conglomerate backed by Li Ka-shing, long famed for being one of Hong Kong’s savviest investors — to get rid of a political hot potato while fetching a good price from BlackRock and company. The group said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it expected to receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale, an amount well above what analysts estimated the ports were worth. But Thursday’s scathing commentary from a newspaper closely aligned with the ruling Communist Party could throw a spanner in the works. It called out CK Hutchison, accusing it of “spineless groveling,” “profit-seeking” and “disregarding national interests and national justice, and betraying and selling out all Chinese people.” “Faced with such a major event and a matter of great justice, the relevant company should think twice … and think carefully about what position and side it should stand on,” it added. The Panama Canal was constructed by the US in the early years of the 20th century and completed in 1914. For most of that century, it was operated by the US, before the Carter Administration negotiated its handover to Panama in a controversial treaty opposed by many Republicans at the time. The 51-mile canal is key to both the movement of international trade and US military vessels. About 4% of the world’s maritime trade and more than 40% of US container traffic traverses the canal. Since its handover in 1999, the canal itself has been operated by Panama, not the Chinese, despite Trump’s stated concerns. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

When Disney announced yet another round of layoffs at ABC News last week, it came on the heels of a year in which almost 15,000 media jobs were lost—and capped off a quarter-century in which we’ve seen thousands of independent publications shut down or merged with larger conglomerates. The upshot is that Americans now find ourselves trapped in an information environment more tightly controlled than ever by a handful of oligarchs. The media has trended in this direction for decades, but the story lost all subtlety when Jeff Bezos issued the X post heard round the world. He declared that The Washington Post will focus its opinion section on “personal liberties and free markets.” That surely means more editorial attention on stifling monopolies like Amazon, right? Jeet Heer Books & the Arts / David Klion Feature / Eamon Whalen Joan Walsh Mainstream media outlets have long faced dwindling audiences and, as a result, relied more and more on corporate benefactors. Now that those benefactors are competing to prove loyalty to their own benefactor in the White House, these essential institutions are stuck carrying water for the billionaire class, or else disappearing altogether. The task of rebuilding truly independent news outlets, then, falls to journalists, readers, and any concerned citizens who recognize how imperiled our free press has become—if there is to be any hope of the fourth estate holding the line against the second Trump regime. Editorial encroachment by corporate interests dates back to the inception of the media age, when the competing newspaper empires of the ultra-wealthy William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer engaged in a sensationalist race to the bottom, publishing incendiary headlines, exaggerations, gossip, and rumors that (among other ramifications) helped provoke the Spanish-American war. Yellow journalism, as it was called, abated thanks to the regulatory efforts of independent agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which established the fairness doctrine requiring equal coverage of conflicting viewpoints on consequential issues (like Trump’s ongoing attempt to take over the FCC). But Ronald Reagan, in his laissez-faire frenzy, repealed that rule. Not to be outdone, Bill Clinton signed the deregulatory Telecommunications Act of 1996, which critics have deemed “essentially bought and paid for by corporate media lobbies.” That same year, The Nation published a special issue on what we called the National Entertainment State. It detailed the growing media-industrial complex, where the corporations programming our news were increasingly programming public opinion. We represented this syndicate via a glossy centerfold diagram of an octopus with four tentacles, one for each of America’s dominant media conglomerates: Disney, General Electric, Time Warner, and Westinghouse (now CBS). Today, six tentacles control over 90 perent of our information. Things are different now, and not for the better. While the news has represented a small cog in larger corporate structures long before this second Trump administration, we are now witnessing mass public capitulation from corporate owners in a way that feels unprecedented. Whether today’s billionaire media owners are angling for large federal contracts or anticipatorily bending the knee so their companies are not seen as “the enemy,” the chilling effect is the same: Major media publications are even more incentivized now to treat the rich and powerful with kid gloves, if not outright sycophancy. The few that refuse to do this will have to face the wrath of our notoriously censorious, litigious head of state. The most powerful man in the world is currently suing Iowa pollster Ann Selzer for merely predicting that Kamala Harris would win the state last November; what he calls “election fraud” most people call “polling.” With that context, is there any reason to expect that prominent players like Paramount and Skydance would do anything but hold the line if it means getting FCC approval for their merger? The natural counterbalance to for-profit media would seem to be nonprofit newsrooms. They need not go cross-eyed from trying to keep in view both the public’s interest and that of their owner. In the US alone, there are at least 475 independent outlets, from the Marshall Project to the Center for Public Integrity, which has won several Pulitzer prizes for its investigative reporting. And independent journalism is currently enjoying a renaissance on self-publishing platforms like Substack and the newly launched Noosphere. These sites offer refuge for writers that have renounced (or been renounced by) corporate news, including Mehdi Hasan and Matt Taibbi. The journalistic equivalent of farm-to-table, it cuts out any meddlesome middle-moguls between the writer and the reader. (The Nation has been independent since 1865.) Yet neither of these alternatives offer a true one-to-one replacement for mainstream outlets. For all their latent bias, our media behemoths are uniquely positioned to furnish the resources to fund years-long investigations that often incur legal backlash, such as the Pentagon Papers—which might not have resonated as deeply with the Mailchimp logo at the bottom. Not so long ago, Jeff Bezos was proud to bear this torch. At the inception of his ownership, he claimed Katharine Graham’s pugnacious leadership as his model, and seemingly sincerely so, even if the Post did go soft on its coverage of Amazon of its own volition. I experienced Bezos’s benign neglect firsthand. From 2011 to 2022, I penned over 500 columns for the paper, most of them during Bezos’s tenure—including columns directly criticizing Amazon’s labor practices and even the corporate bias of the Post itself. I never received any note remotely resembling the kind of editorial restrictions that he is imposing today—the likes of which just led the columnist and associate editor Ruth Marcus to resign after four decades at the paper. Nevertheless, for a time, at least in this case, corporate ownership didn’t have to be mutually exclusive with editorial independence. But until that détente between owner and editorial is reestablished, audiences and reporters will continue to flee compromised publications. In his e-mail to The Washington Post’s team, Bezos argued that this newspaper of record could dodge offering a variety of perspectives because “the internet does that job.” It will take a new movement of responsible readers and benefactors to ensure that this is true. Donald Trump’s cruel and chaotic second term is just getting started. In his first month back in office, Trump and his lackey Elon Musk (or is it the other way around?) have proven that nothing is safe from sacrifice at the altar of unchecked power and riches. Only robust independent journalism can cut through the noise and offer clear-eyed reporting and analysis based on principle and conscience. That’s what The Nation has done for 160 years and that’s what we’re doing now. Our independent journalism doesn’t allow injustice to go unnoticed or unchallenged—nor will we abandon hope for a better world. Our writers, editors, and fact-checkers are working relentlessly to keep you informed and empowered when so much of the media fails to do so out of credulity, fear, or fealty. The Nation has seen unprecedented times before. We draw strength and guidance from our history of principled progressive journalism in times of crisis, and we are committed to continuing this legacy today. We’re aiming to raise $25,000 during our Spring Fundraising Campaign to ensure that we have the resources to expose the oligarchs and profiteers attempting to loot our republic. Stand for bold independent journalism and donate to support The Nation today.

Title: Nvidia Stock To $60?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/14/nvidia-stock-to-60/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. NVDA Stock Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 60% or more in the upcoming months? Although this might seem extreme, such an occurrence has happened before and could repeat itself. Earlier this year, Nvidia stock experienced a sell-off, dropping from approximately $148 in mid-January to around $115 now, which represents a nearly 23% decrease. This decline has been fueled by several factors, such as the introduction of more resource-efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek and worries that decelerating investments in generative AI might reduce the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Additionally, the overall market is undergoing a significant sell-off, spurred by increasing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Separately, see Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track? Here’s the point: The key takeaway is that during a downturn, NVDA stock might incur substantial losses. Data from 2022 indicates that NVDA stock lost more than 60% of its value in only a few quarters. Currently, Nvidia stock has decreased from $148 to $115 in roughly two months. This raises the question: could the stock continue its downward trend and reach approximately $60 if a similar situation were to unfold? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are looking for growth with reduced volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception. Slowdown in AI Demand: Over the last two years, companies have significantly invested in training AI models, with Nvidia’s GPUs becoming the preferred option due to their performance and efficiency. The short-term outlook remains robust, as tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are increasing capital expenditures for 2025 to expand their AI cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, demand may eventually taper off. Since AI model training is predominantly a one-time, compute-intensive process, it could eventually decelerate. As models increase in size, incremental performance improvements are anticipated to diminish, and the supply of high-quality training data might become a limiting factor. Consequently, as the demand for training declines, GPU sales could also decrease. Therefore, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture, the U.S. economy might enter a downturn, potentially even a recession, which could further affect GPU sales. Because AI investments continue to be unprofitable for most companies, they may be prime candidates for cost-cutting measures during an economic downturn. This situation could significantly impact Nvidia. The transition to more resource-efficient AI models could also affect Nvidia. China’s DeepSeek model, launched in January, attracted attention for prioritizing software-driven optimization instead of relying on hardware, which could potentially reduce the demand for GPUs. The company reports that it spent only $5.5 million to train its V3 model, which is only a fraction of the hundreds of millions that firms such as OpenAI are said to have spent. Since DeepSeek’s model is open source, major tech companies might adopt similar cost-cutting strategies. If this approach is widely implemented, it could further reduce the demand for AI computing power. For further information, see how DeepSeek impacts Nvidia The U.S. government has imposed export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s latest AI chipset products destined for China, with the exception of the H20 chips, citing national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are using entities registered outside of China to purchase servers equipped with Nvidia’s latest products from companies in various countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This is particularly concerning as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, generating approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25 (around 18% of revenue), compared to only $2.3 billion (8% of revenue) in FY’23. Singapore has now initiated an investigation into these potential loopholes. Such developments could potentially affect Nvidia’s overall revenue to some degree. For further details, see how Trump’s tariffs affect Nvidia stock. NVDA stock has experienced a decline that was marginally more severe than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Are you concerned about how a market crash might affect NVDA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock’s performance during and following previous market crashes. • NVDA stock declined by 62.7% from a peak of $30.12 on 3 January 2022 to $11.23 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, it has risen to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and is currently trading at approximately $115 • NVDA stock dropped by 37.6% from a high of $7.87 on 19 February 2020 to $4.91 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% decline for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 11 May 2020 • NVDA stock declined by 85.1% from a high of $0.99 on 17 October 2007 to $0.15 on 20 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 13 May 2016 NVIDIA’s Revenues have soared, increasing at an average rate of 80.1% over the past three years, which is significantly higher than the 6.3% increase in S&P 500 revenues. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s valuation remains attractive given its strong growth, with the stock trading at approximately 26x consensus FY’26 earnings. Yet, there are some potential risks. In recent quarters, net margins have exceeded an impressive 50%, propelled by robust pricing power and high demand for AI chips. Still, these margins could be at risk if demand declines or if competition intensifies. A slowdown in demand could result in reduced pricing, lower sales volumes, and a significant decline in profitability. As an aside, check out the large move in this quantum computing stock in What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Considering the potential for a slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: Will you continue holding your NVDA stock, or will you panic and sell if it starts falling to $70, $60, or even lower prices? Maintaining a position in a declining stock is always challenging.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs are here and disrupting the markets, with new duties on aluminum and steel and threats against European spirits. He’s created a trade war with Canada, which just got a new prime minister, and slammed stocks. Despite that, Trump officials — and the president himself — have said tariffs are key to the U.S.’ economic strategy, and more duties are waiting in the wings. That could cause issues for companies like Boeing, which has warned of potential supply issues if Trump’s tariffs stick around for a while. Tesla is taking hits tied to CEO Elon Musk’s role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which has helped federal agencies enact mass layoffs and other cost-cutting measures (and given Mark Cuban an idea). Amazon is also appealing to Trump, as founder Jeff Bezos courts the president. Catch up on all that and more — including three senators’ demands for Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — in this week’s politics roundup. 2 / 12 President Donald Trump’s latest bid to tackle the European Union’s “hostile and abusive” trading practices is to tack new duties on alcohol imports.

Title: Power Cut
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/power-cut/
Time Published: 2025-03-14T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
A week ago, analyst TD Cowen revealed that Microsoft had canceled leases "totalling a couple hundred MWs," with "at least two private data center operators across multiple US markets." The report also details how Microsoft "pulled back on converting negotiated and signed Statement[s] of Qualifications (SQQs)," which it added was "the precursor to a data center lease." Although the analyst added it was unclear whether Microsoft might convert them in the future, these SQQs converted into leases "close to 100%" of the time. Cancelling them was, therefore, rather unusual. TD Cowen also added that Microsoft was "re-allocating a considerable portion of [its] projected international spend to the US, which suggests to [TD Cowen] a material slowdown in international leasing." But one crucial, teeny tiny part of the report was missed by just about everybody, emphasis mine: What TD Cowen is saying is not just that "Microsoft canceled some data centers," but that Microsoft also effectively canceled over a gigawatt of data center operations on top of the previously-reported "multiple +100W megawatt deals." If we add in the land under contract, and the deals that were in-flight, the total capacity likely amounts to even more than that. For some context, Data Center Dynamics reported that Microsoft had 5GW of data center capacity in April 2024, saying that Microsoft had planned to add 1 gigawatt of capacity by October 2024, and another 1.5 gigawatts of capacity by the first half of 2025. Based on this reporting, one can estimate that Microsoft has somewhere between 6 and 7 gigawatts of capacity at this time. As a result, based on TD Cowen's analysis, Microsoft has, through a combination of canceled leases, pullbacks on Statements of Qualifications, cancellations of land parcels and deliberate expiration of Letters of Intent, effectively abandoned data center expansion equivalent to over 14% of its current capacity. These numbers heavily suggest that Microsoft — the biggest purchaser of NVIDIA's GPUs and, according to TD Cowen, "the most active [data center] lessee of capacity in 2023 and 1H24" — does not believe there is future growth in generative AI, nor does it have faith in (nor does it want responsibility for) the future of OpenAI. Data center buildouts take about three to six years to complete, and the largest hyperscale facilities can easily cost several billion dollars, meaning that these moves are extremely forward-looking. You don’t build a data center for the demand you have now, but for the demand you expect further down the line. This suggests that Microsoft believes its current infrastructure (and its likely scaled-back plans for expansion) will be sufficient for a movement that CEO Satya Nadella called a "golden age for systems" less than a year ago. To quote TD Cowen again: To explain here, TD Cowen is effectively saying that Microsoft is responding to a "major demand signal" and said "major demand signal" is saying "you do not need more data centers." Said demand signal that Microsoft was responding to, in TD Cowen's words, is its "appetite for capacity" to provide servers to OpenAI, and it seems that said appetite is waning, and Microsoft no longer wants to build out data centers for OpenAI. The reason I'm writing in such blunt-force terms is that I want to make it clear that Microsoft is effectively cutting its data center expansion by over a gigawatt of capacity, if not more, and it’s impossible to reconcile these cuts with the expectation that generative AI will be a massive, transformative technological phenomenon. I believe the reason Microsoft is cutting back is that it does not have the appetite to provide further data center expansion for OpenAI, and it’s having doubts about the future of generative AI as a whole. If Microsoft believed there was a massive opportunity in supporting OpenAI's further growth, or that it had "massive demand" for generative AI services, there would be no reason to cancel capacity, let alone cancel such a significant amount. These moves also suggest that Microsoft is walking away from building and training further large frontier models, and from supporting doing so for others. Remember, Microsoft has significantly more insight into the current health and growth of generative AI than any other company. As OpenAI's largest backer and infrastructural partner (and the owners of the server architecture where OpenAI trains its ultra-expensive models, not to mention the largest shareholder in OpenAI), Microsoft can see exactly what is (or isn't) coming down the pike, on top of having a view both into the sales of its own generative AI-powered software (such as Microsoft 365 Copilot) and sales of both model services and cloud compute for other models on Microsoft Azure. In plain English, Microsoft, which arguably has more data than anybody else about the health of the generative AI industry and its potential for growth, has decided that it needs to dramatically slow down its expansion. Expansion which, to hammer the point home, is absolutely necessary for generative AI to continue evolving and expanding. Cushman and Wakefield's 2024 Global Data Center Market Comparison gives some chilling context into how significant Microsoft's pullback is. A gigawatt of data center capacity is roughly the entire operational IT load of Tokyo (1.028GW), orLondon (996MW), or the Bay Area (842MW). And, again, the total figure is likely far higher than a gigawatt. That number only accounts for the LOIs that Microsoft allowed to expire. It doesn’t include everything else, like the two data centers it already killed, or the land parcels it abandoned, or the deals that were in the early-to-mid stages of negotiation. Microsoft is not simply "walking back some future plans." It is effectively canceling (what it has loudly insisted is) the future. If you think that sounds hyperbolic, consider this: London and Tokyo are respectively the biggest data center markets in Europe and Asia, according to the same Cushman and Wakefield report. In the event that Microsoft believed there was meaningful growth in generative AI, it wouldn't be canceling anything, or at the very least wouldn't be canceling so much. Canceling cities-worth of capacity at a time when artificial intelligence is supposedly revolutionizing everything suggests that artificial intelligence isn't really revolutionizing anything. One other detail in TD Cowen's report really stood out. While there is a pullback in Microsoft's data center leasing, it’s seen a "commensurate rise in demand from Oracle related to The Stargate Project" — a relatively new partnership of "up to $500 billion" to build massive new data centers for AI, led by SoftBank, and OpenAI, with investment from Oracle and MGX, a $100 billion investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates. OpenAI has committed $19 billion to the Stargate project — money it doesn't have, meaning that part of $25 billion to $40 billion funding round that OpenAI is currently raising will be committed to funding these data centers (unless, as I'll get to later, OpenAI raises more debt). Leading the round is SoftBank, which is also committing $19 billion, as well as creating a joint venture called SB OpenAI Japan to offer OpenAI's services to the Japanese market, as well as "spending $3 billion annually to use OpenAI's technology across its group businesses" according to the Wall Street Journal. In simpler terms, SoftBank is investing as much as $25 billion in OpenAI, then spending another $3 billion a year on software that only loses money, and still hallucinates, and shows no sign of getting meaningfully better or more reliable. Whether Softbank actually sees value in OpenAI’s tech, or whether this purchase deal is a subsidy by the backdoor, is open to debate. Given that $3bn is equivalent to OpenAI’s entire revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT in 2024 — which included some major deals with the likes of PriceWaterhouseCoopers — I’m inclined to believe the latter. Even then, how feasible is it that SoftBank can continue paying? To get the deal done, Microsoft changed the terms of its exclusive relationship with OpenAI to allow it to work with Oracle to build out further data centers full of the GPUs necessary to power its unprofitable, unsustainable models. The Oracle/Stargate situation was a direct result — according to reporting from The Information — of OpenAI becoming frustrated with Microsoft for not providing it with servers fast enough, including an allotment of 300,000 of NVIDIA's GB200 chips by the end of 2025. For what it’s worth, The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft was getting increasingly frustrated with OpenAI’s constant demands for more compute. The relationship between the two entities had started to fray, with both sides feeling somewhat aggrieved. This, combined with Microsoft's data center pullback, heavily suggests that Microsoft is no longer interested in being OpenAI's infrastructure partner long-term — after all, if it was, it'd fund and support OpenAI’s expansion rather than doing the literal opposite. Here's a question: if generative AI had so much demand, why is Microsoft canceling data center contracts? Why is Microsoft — Oracle's largest customer as of the end of 2023 — allowing SoftBank and OpenAI to work with Oracle to build the future rather than itself? As mentioned previously, TD Cowen specifically noted in its report that Microsoft's "shift in appetite for capacity [was] tied to OpenAI," which heavily suggests that Microsoft is, at best, less invested in the future of OpenAI, a statement confirmed by The Information, which adds that Microsoft had been trying to "lessen its reliance on OpenAI technology as they increasingly compete in selling AI products." At worst, this situation could suggest that Microsoft is actively dumping OpenAI, and is having questions about the fundamentals of the generative AI industry. In very plain terms, Microsoft, despite its excitement around artificial intelligence and its dogged insistence that it’s the future of technology, has canceled data center leases and over a gigawatt of other datacenter infrastructure. Doing so heavily suggests that Microsoft does not intend to expand its data center operations, or at least, to the extraordinary levels the company initially promised. While Microsoft has reiterated that it intends to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025, it's unclear how it intends to do so if it’s pulling back on data center expansion at such a large scale, and the company has provided no tangible explanation or elaboration as to how it might do so. While hardware upgrades could account for some of its capital expenditures, it would be nowhere near the $80bn figure. Again, hyperscale datacenters aren’t cheap. They’re massive, billion-dollar (or multi-billion) ventures. Microsoft also added in a comment to CNBC in the same article that it "[continues] to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand." Quick question: what customer demand? Microsoft said back in April 2024 that "AI demand was exceeding supply even after a 79% surge in capital expenditures," and CFO Amy Hood said in its next quarterly earnings in July 2024 that "demand remained higher than [Microsoft's] available capacity." On its most recent (January 2025) earnings call, CFO Amy Hood once said "Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year over year and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity." Riddle me this, Batman — why does a company that keeps talking about having demand that exceeds capacity decide to cancel multiple data centers which, collectively, account for a significant chunk of its existing capacity? Let's see what Microsoft had to say when asked a week or two ago! Sounds like Microsoft built too much capacity, and in fact has yet to see the consumer demand to actually reach it! In fact, a couple of weeks ago Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a podcast interview that "one of the things is that there will be [as a result of data center expansion related to AI] overbuild." Microsoft also in late January said it had “$13 billion in annual recurring revenue” from AI — not profit, and “AI” is not a line item on its earnings, meaning this is all related revenue put into a ball with no context. Either way, this is a piddly amount that works out to about $3.25 billion a quarter. These are mediocre numbers and Microsoft’s data center pullback suggests that they’re not going to improve. According to The Information, OpenAI plans to have Stargate handle three quarters of its computing needs by 2030, which heavily suggests that Microsoft canceling so much capacity is, on some level, linked to OpenAI’s future plans. While The Information reports that OpenAI is still forecasting to spend $13 billion in 2025 and as much as $28 billion in 2028 on Microsoft’s cloud compute, in addition to whatever capacity it gets from Stargate or Oracle, one has to wonder how it intends to do so if it needs the capacity Microsoft simply isn’t building. These are two huge numbers. For context, $13 billion is about ten percent of Microsoft’s cloud revenue in the 2024 fiscal year, though it's unclear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute as revenue. Nevertheless, I have real concerns about whether OpenAI is even capable of expanding further, starting with a fairly obvious one: its only source of money, SoftBank. Let’s start with a few facts: Doing some napkin maths, here’s what SoftBank has agreed to: SoftBank made about $12.14 billion (1.83 Trillion Yen) in revenue in Q4 2024, losing $2.449 billion (369.17 billion Yen), but made a profit of about $7.82 billion (1.18 trillion Yen) in Q3 2024. Nevertheless, SoftBank has agreed to effectively bankroll OpenAI’s future — agreeing to over $46 billion of investments over the next few years — and does not appear to be able to do so without selling its current holdings in valuable companies like ARM or taking on at least $16 billion of debt this year, representing a 55% increase over its current liabilities. Worse still, thanks to this agreement, OpenAI’s future — both in its ability to expand its infrastructure (which appears to be entirely contingent on the construction of Stargate) and its ability to raise funding — is entirely dependent on SoftBank, which in turn must borrow money to fund it. On top of that, OpenAI anticipates it will burn as much as $40 billion a year by 2028, and projects to only turn a profit “by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate,” which, I add, is almost entirely dependent on SoftBank, which has to take on debt to fund both OpenAI and the project required to (allegedly, theoretically) make OpenAI profitable. How the fuck does this work? OpenAI, a company that spent $9 billion to lose $5 billion in 2024, requires so much money to meet its obligations (both to cover its ruinous, unprofitable, unsustainable operations and the $18bn to $19bn it committed to keep growing) that it has to raise more money than any startup has ever raised in history — $40 billion — with the cast-iron guarantee that it will need more money within a year. To raise said money, the only benefactor willing to provide it (SoftBank) has to borrow money, and is not able to give OpenAI said money up front in part because it does not have it. SoftBank — on top of the $30 billion of funding and $3 billion a year in revenue it’s committed to OpenAI itself — also has to cough up $18 billion for Stargate, a data center project that OpenAI will run and SoftBank will take financial responsibility for. That’s $48 billion in cash, and $3 billion in revenue, the latter of which, like all of OpenAI’s offerings, loses the company money. OpenAI has no path to profitability, guaranteeing it will need more cash, and right now — at the time when it needs the most it’s ever needed — SoftBank, the only company willing to provide it, has proven that it will have to go to great lengths to do so. If OpenAI needs $40 billion in 2025, how much will it need in 2026? $50 billion? $100 billion? Where is that money going to come from? While SoftBank might be able to do this once, what happens when OpenAI needs more money in 6-to-12 months? SoftBank made about $15 billion of profit in the last year on about $46 billion of revenue. $3 billion is an obscene amount to commit to buying OpenAI’s software annually, especially when some of it is allegedly for access to OpenAI’s barely-functional “Operator” and mediocre “Deep Research” products. As per my previous pieces, I do not see how OpenAI survives, and SoftBank’s involvement only gives me further concern. While SoftBank could theoretically burn its current holdings to fund OpenAI in perpetuity, its ability to do so is cast into doubt by them having to borrow money from other banks to get both this funding round and Stargate done. OpenAI burned $5 billion in 2024, a number it’ll likely double in 2025 (remember, the Information reported that OpenAI was projected to spend $13 billion on compute alone with Microsoft in 2025), and it has no path to profitability. SoftBank has already had to borrow to fund this round, and the fact it had to do so suggests its inability to continue supporting OpenAI without accruing further debt. OpenAI (as a result of Microsoft’s cuts to data center capacity) now only has one real path to expansion once it runs through whatever remaining buildout Microsoft has planned, and that’s Stargate, a project funded by OpenAI’s contribution (which it’s receiving from SoftBank) and SoftBank, which is having to take loans to meet its share. How does this work, exactly? How does this continue? Do you see anyone else stepping up to fund this? Who else has got $30 billion to throw at this nonsense? While the answer is “Saudi Arabia,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son recently said that he had “not given [Saudi ruler Mohammed Bin Salman] enough return,” adding that he “still owed him.” Nothing about this suggests that Saudi money will follow SoftBank’s in anywhere near the volume necessary. As for the Emiratis, they’re already involved through the MGX fund, and it’s unclear how much more they’d be willing to commit. No, really, how does this work? In my opinion, the OpenAI-SoftBank deal is wildly unsustainable, dependent on SoftBank continuing to both raise debt and funnel money directly into a company that burns billions of dollars a year, and is set to only burn more thanks to the arrival of its latest model. And if it had a huge breakthrough that would change everything, wouldn’t Microsoft want to make sure they’d built the data center capacity to support it? About GPT-4.5… Last week, OpenAI launched GPT 4.5, its latest model that…well…Sam Altman says “is the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person.” It is not obvious what it does better, or even really what it does, other than Altman says it is “a different kind of intelligence and there’s a magic to it [he hasn’t] felt before.” This was, in Altman’s words, “the good news.” The bad news was that, and I quote, GPT 4.5 is “...a giant, expensive model,” adding that OpenAI was “out of GPUs,” but proudly declaring that it’d add “tens of thousands of GPUs the next week” to roll it out to OpenAI’s $20-a-month “plus tier” and that he would be adding “hundreds of thousands [of GPUs]” “soon.” Excited? Well you shouldn’t be. On top of a vague product-set and indeterminately-high compute costs, GPT 4.5 costs an incredible $75 per million input tokens (prompts and data pushed into a model) and $150 per million output tokens (as in the output it creates), or roughly 3,000% more for input tokens and 1,500% more expensive for output tokens than GPT-4o for results OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy described as “a little bit better and…awesome…but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to,” and one developer described 4.5 to ArsTechnica as “a lemon” when comparing its reported performance to its price. ArsTechnica also described GPT-4.5 as “terrible for coding, relatively speaking,” and other tests showed that the model’s performance was either slightly better or slightly worse across the board, with, according to ArsTechnica one “success” metric being that OpenAI found human evaluators "preferred GPT 4.5’s responses over GPT-4o in about 57% of interactions. So, to be crystal clear, the biggest AI company’s latest model appears to be even more ruinously expensive than its last one while providing modest-at-best improvements and performing worse on several benchmarks than competing models. Despite these piss-poor results, Sam Altman’s reaction is to bring hundreds of thousands of GPUs online as a means of exposing as many people as possible to his mediocre, ultra-expensive model, and the best that Altman has to offer is that this is “...the first time people have been emailing with such passion asking [OpenAI] to promise to never stop offering a specific model.” This, by the way, is the company that’s about to raise $40 billion led by a Japanese bank that has to go into debt to fund both OpenAI’s operations and the infrastructure necessary for it to grow any further. Again, Microsoft is cancelling plans to massively expand its data center capacity right at a time when OpenAI just released its most computationally-demanding model ever. How do you reconcile those two things without concluding either that Microsoft expects GPT-4.5 to be a flop, or that it’s simply unwilling to continue bankrolling OpenAI’s continued growth, or that it’s having doubts about the future of generative AI as a whole? I have been — and remain — hesitant to “call the bubble bursting,” because bubbles do not burst in neat little events. Nevertheless, my pale horses I’ve predicted in the past were led by one specific call — that a reduction in capital expenditures by a hyperscaler was a sign that things were collapsing. Microsoft walking away from over a Gigawatt of data center plans — equivalent to as much as 14% of its current data center capacity — is a direct sign that it does not believe the growth is there in generative AI, and thus are not building the infrastructure to support it, and indeed may have overbuilt — something that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has directly foreshadowed. The entirety of the tech industry — and the AI bubble — has been built on the assumption that generative AI was the next big growth vehicle for the tech industry, and if Microsoft, the largest purchaser of NVIDIA GPUs and the most aggressive builder of AI infrastructure, is reducing capacity, it heavily suggests that the growth is not there. Microsoft has, by the looks of things, effectively given up on further data center expansion. At least, at the breakneck pace it once promised. AI boosters will reply by saying there’s something I don’t know — that in fact Microsoft has some greater strategy, but answer me this: why is Microsoft canceling over a gigawatt of data center expansion? And, again, this is the most conservative estimate. The realistic number is much, much higher. Do you think it’s because it expects there to be this dramatic demand for their artificial intelligence services? Do you think it’s reducing supply because of all of the demand? One might argue that Microsoft’s reduction in capacity buildout is just a sign that OpenAI is moving its compute elsewhere, and while that might be true, here’re some questions to ask: Microsoft making such a material pullback on data center expansion suggests that the growth in generative AI products, both those run on Microsoft’s servers and those sold as part of Microsoft’s products, do not have the revolutionary growth-trajectory that both CFO Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella have been claiming, and this is deeply concerning, while also calling into concern the viability of generative AI as a growth vehicle for any hyperscaler. If I am correct, Microsoft is walking away from not just the expansion of its current data center operations, but from generative AI writ large. I actually believe it will continue selling this unprofitable, unsustainable software, because the capacity it has right now is more than sufficient to deal with the lack of demand. It is time for investors and the general public to begin demanding tangible and direct numbers on the revenue and profits related to generative AI, as it is becoming increasingly obvious that the revenues are small and the profits are non-existent. A gigawatt of capacity is huge, and walking away from that much capacity is a direct signal that Microsoft’s long term plans do not include needing a great deal of compute. One counter could be that it’s waiting for more of the specialized NVIDIA GPUs to arrive, to which the response is “Microsoft still wants to build the capacity so that it has somewhere to put them.” Again, these facilities take anywhere between three and six years to build. Do you really think Blackwell will be delayed that long? NVIDIA committed to a once-a-year cycle for their AI chips after all. One counter could be that there isn’t the power necessary to power these data centers, and if that’s the case — it isn’t, but let me humour the idea — then the suggestion is that Microsoft is currently changing its entire data center strategy so significantly that it now has to issue over a gigawatt’s worth of statements of intent across the country to different places with…more power? Another counter is that I’m only talking about leases, and not purchases. In that case, I’ll refer you to this article from CBRE, which provides an elucidating read on how hyperscalers actually invest in data center infrastructure. Leases tend to account for the majority of spending, simply because it’s less risky. A specialist takes care of the tough stuff — like finding a location, buying the land, handling construction — and the hyperscaler isn’t left trying to figure out what to do with the facility when it reaches the end of its useful lifecycle. I also recognize that this is kind of a big, juicy steak for someone people call an “AI cynic.” I have poured over this data repeatedly, and done all I can to find less-convenient conclusions. Letters of Intent are likely the weakest part of the argument — these are serious documents, but not always legally-binding. Neither are SoQs, but as TD Cowen points out, these are treated as the green light to start work on construction, even though a formal lease agreement hasn’t yet been signed. And to be clear, Microsoft let an indeterminate amount of those go too. Nevertheless, it is incredibly significant that Microsoft is letting so many — the equivalent of as much as 14% of its current data center capacity, at a bare minimum — on top of the “couple hundred” (at least 200) megawatts of data center leases that it’s outright canceled. I do not know why nobody else has done this analysis. I have now read every single piece about the TD Cowen report from every single outlet that covered it. I am astounded by the lack of curiosity as to what “1GW+” means in a report that meaningfully moved markets, as I am equally astounded by the lack of curiosity to contextualize most tech news. It is as if nobody wants to think about this too hard — that nobody wants to stop the party, to accept what’s been staring us in the face since last year, and when given the most egregious, glaring evidence they must find ways to dismiss it rather than give it the energy it deserves. Far more resources were dedicated to finding ways to gussy up the releases of Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.7 or OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 than were given to the report from an investment bank’s research wing that the largest spender in generative AI — the largest backer (for now) of OpenAI — is massively reducing its expenditures in the data centers required for the industry (and for OpenAI, a company ostensibly worth at least $157 billion, and which Microsoft owns the largest stake) to expand. Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI is a bit fuzzy, as OpenAI doesn’t issue traditional equity, and there’s a likelihood it may be diluted as more money comes in. It reportedly owned 49% in 2023. Assuming that’s still the case, are we to believe that Microsoft is willing to strangle an asset worth at least $75bn (several times more than its investment to date) by cancelling a few leases? How many more alarms do we need to go off before people recognize that something bad is happening? Why is it that tangible, meaningful evidence that we’re in a bubble — and possibly a sign that it has actually popped — is less interesting than the fact that Claude Sonnet 3.7 “can think longer”? I do not write this newsletter to “be right.” I do not write it to “be a cynic” or “hater.” I write this because I am trying to understand what’s going on, and if I do not do that I will actually go insane. Every time I sit down to write it is because I am trying to understand what it is that’s happening and how I feel about it, and these are the only terms that dictate my newsletter. It just happens that I have stared at the tech industry for too long, and now I can’t look away. Perhaps it is driving me mad, perhaps I am getting smarter, or some combination of the two, but what comes out of it is not driven by wanting to “go viral” or “have a hot take,” because such things suggest that I would write something different if three people read it versus the 57,000 that subscribe. I am not saying that Microsoft is dying, or making any grandiose claims about what happens next. What I am describing is the material contraction of the largest investor in data centers according to TD Cowen, potentially at a scale that suggests that it has meaningfully reduced its interest in further expansion of data centers writ large. This is a deeply concerning move, one that suggests that Microsoft does not see enough demand to sustain its current expansions, which has greater ramifications beyond generative AI, because it suggests that there isn’t any other reason for it to expand the means of delivering software. What has Satya Nadella seen? What is Microsoft CFO Amy Hood doing? What is the plan here? And really, what’s the plan with OpenAI? SoftBank has committed to over $40 billion of costs that it cannot currently afford, taking on as much as $24 billion in debt in the next year to help sustain one more funding round and the construction of data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses money on literally every single customer. To survive, OpenAI must continue raising more money than any startup has ever raised before, and they are only able to do so from SoftBank, which in turn must take on debt. OpenAI burned $5 billion in 2024, will likely burn $11 billion in 2025, and will continue burning money in perpetuity, and to scale further will require further funding for a data center project funded partially by funding from a company taking on debt to fund them. And when you put all of this together, all that I can see is a calamity. Generative AI does not have meaningful mass-market use cases, and while ChatGPT may have 400 million weekly active users, as I described last week, there doesn’t appear to be meaningful consumer adoption outside of ChatGPT, mostly because almost all AI coverage inevitably ends up marketing one company: OpenAI. Argue with me all you want about your personal experiences with ChatGPT, or how you’ve found it personally useful. That doesn’t make it a product with mass-market utility, or enterprise utility, or worth the vast sums of money being ploughed into generative AI. Worse still, there doesn’t appear to be meaningful revenue. As discussed above, Microsoft claims $13 billion in annual recurring revenue (not profit) on all AI products combined on over $200 billion of capital expenditures since 2023, and no other hyperscaler is willing to break out any AI revenue at all. Not Amazon. Not Meta. Not Google. Nobody. Where is the growth? Where is all this money going? Why is Microsoft canceling a Gigawatt of data center capacity while telling everybody that it didn’t have enough data centers to handle demand for its AI products? I suppose there’s one way of looking at it: that Microsoft may currently have a capacity issue, but soon won’t, meaning that further expansion is unnecessary. If that’s the case, it’ll be interesting to see whether their peers follow suit. Either way, I see nothing that suggests that there’s further growth in generative AI. In fact, I think it’s time for everybody to seriously consider that big tech burned billions of dollars on something that nobody really wanted. If you read this and scoff — what should I have written about? Anthropic adding a sliding “thinking” bar to a model? GPT-4.5? Who cares! Can you even tell me what it does differently to GPT-4o? Can you explain to me why it matters? Or are you more interested in nakedly-captured imbeciles like Ethan Mollick sweatily oinking about how powerful the latest Large Language Models are to notice the real things happening in the real world with buildings and silicon and actual infrastructure? Wake the fuck up, everybody! Things are on fire. I get it. It’s scary to move against the consensus. But people are wondering, right now, why you didn’t write about this, and indeed why you seem more concerned with protecting the current market hype cycle than questioning it. There are no “phony comforts of being an AI skeptic” — what I am writing about here, as I regularly remind you, is extremely scary stuff. If I’m right, tech’s only growth story is dead.

Title: Ecommerce: 50 Essential Elements for an Optimized and High-Conversion Product Detail Page
URL: https://martech.zone/ecommerce-product-page-checklist/
Time Published: 2025-03-13T21:47:23Z
Full Content:
A Product Detail Page (PDP) is the dedicated page on an E-commerce website where customers can find all the relevant information about a specific product. This page is a digital storefront, offering a comprehensive overview of the product’s features, benefits, specifications, pricing, and purchasing options. A well-optimized PDP informs potential buyers and enhances their shopping experience, builds trust, and ultimately drives conversions. To be effective, a PDP should be designed with user experience, search engine optimization (SEO), and conversion rate optimization (CRO) in mind, ensuring that customers receive all the necessary details to make an informed purchase decision. The above-the-fold section refers to the content immediately visible when a customer lands on the product page without needing to scroll. This is the most critical area of the PDP as it creates the first impression and determines whether the visitor will continue engaging with the product or leave. Essential elements in this section include the product’s name, pricing, availability, images, and a compelling call-to-action (CTA). Additionally, trust signals like star ratings, security badges, and social proof help reassure potential buyers. An effectively designed above-the-fold section ensures that customers receive all vital information upfront, reducing hesitation and encouraging immediate action. Once a customer scrolls past the initial view, the below-the-fold section offers more comprehensive details about the product. This includes extended product descriptions, technical specifications, customer reviews, FAQs, and warranty or return policies. At this stage, shoppers are seeking additional validation before making a purchase decision. Providing in-depth information and user-generated content, such as ratings and testimonials, can help alleviate doubts and reinforce trust. This section also presents opportunities for cross-selling and upselling by showcasing related or complementary products. A well-structured below-the-fold section ensures that customers stay engaged and feel confident in their decision. The footer of a product detail page plays a vital role in reinforcing credibility and guiding users toward additional resources.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

March 13, 2025 15:53 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: An early TikTok investor is $17 billion richer this year, making him the wealthiest man in finance after Warren Buffett

Many of the world's wealthiest people have taken heavy blows to their personal fortunes this year as recession fears continue to weigh on stocks. Yet one Wall Street titan has leaped up the rich list, growing his net worth more than anybody else. Jeff Yass, the cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, has gained an unmatched $17.2 billion in wealth this year as of Wednesday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In contrast, Elon Musk has had $113 billion wiped off his net worth as Tesla stock has tanked 39% this year. Oracle's Larry Ellison, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Microsoft's Steve Ballmer have each had at least $12 billion of their wealth erased too. Yass' gain this year has boosted his personal fortune from about $47 billion to $63 billion, ranking him 23rd on the wealth index. He's now the richest man in finance after Warren Buffett, the fourth-biggest gainer with a $13.4 billion rise this year. The wealth surge for Yass, 66, stems from an early investment in ByteDance. He still owns about 7% of the Chinese social media company behind TikTok. ByteDance intends to repurchase employees' shares at a valuation of about $312 billion, up from $268 billion at the end of 2023, Bloomberg recently reported. Moreover, ByteDance investors SoftBank, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price have raised their internal valuation estimates to north of $400 billion. The upshot is Yass' reported stake may have jumped in value by roughly 50% in a little over a year. Susquehanna is also worth almost $50 billion, and Yass owns upward of 51% of the firm, regulatory filings show. Yass didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Yass is a Republican mega-donor who supported President Donald Trump's campaign. He's benefited from the US leader's decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok and its US operations over national security concerns. Trump said last year that banning TikTok would make young Americans "go crazy," and he didn't want Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to sweep in and take its place. Art Dantchik, who cofounded Susquehanna with Yass and is also a ByteDance director, has seen his wealth jump by $6.5 billion to reach almost $17 billion this year, putting him in 122nd place on the rich list. Yass, 66, is the son of two accountants and graduated as a math major, he says in a video on Susquehanna's YouTube channel. He moved to Las Vegas and spent about 18 months playing poker before becoming an independent options trader. After realizing how lucrative the sector was, he recruited his poker buddies from college to work at his own firm. Games remain a core part of Susquehanna's culture, according to its website. Employees can take part in board game nights, complete puzzles dotted around the office, and compete in an annual poker tournament. Managers also use strategy games to teach lessons to new employees.

Title: Good inflation reports may hide an unpleasant surprise: Progress probably stalled

Inflation reports, which showed better-than-expected slowdowns in consumer and wholesale prices last month, may be hiding an unpleasant surprise, Bank of America (BAC+1.89%) economists said: Progress on the Fed’s favorite indicator has probably stalled. Parsing the reports released yesterday and today shows that the monthly increase in core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) may have picked slightly up to 0.4% in February, with the year-over-year changes also picking up slightly, the bank’s U.S. economists Jeseo Park and Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients. “Our forecast for PCE inflation reinforces our view that inflation is unlikely to fall enough for the Fed to cut this year, especially given policy changes that boost inflation,” the economists said. “We maintain our view that policy rates will stay on hold through year-end unless activity data really weakens.” The Federal Reserve will meet next Wednesday to decide on interest rates. While it’s not expected to cut this time, some other observers have said that investors’ concerns over a possibly softening economy — reflected in falling stock prices — mean that policymakers could cut as soon as May and up to twice more later in the year. Comerica (CMA+0.74%) said in a note to clients that details from the producer price index (PPI) wholesale report suggest that the PCE report will be benign for markets — in contrast to BofA — but added that the outlook for inflation now depends more on tariffs, deportations and the Department of Government Efficiency. Today’s benign PPI report wasn’t enough to support stocks after President Donald Trump said he’ll impose 200% tariffs on alcohol imported from the EU, escalating the trade war. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5% as of about 12:05 p.m., the S&P 500 fell 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 446 points, or about 1.1%.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The watch and accessories company is the latest to shore up its wholesale channel and pull back on direct-to-consumer sales. Fossil is the latest brand to pull back on DTC in a quest for profitability. Last year the company closed a net 54 stores globally, ending 2024 with 248, including 114 in the Americas. Remaining locations will get upgrades, emphasize traditional watches and highlight personalization, CEO Franco Fogliato, who arrived in September, told analysts Wednesday. “Looking at our direct-to-consumer business, we believe there is a significant opportunity to strengthen our model, becoming smaller but much more profitable,” he said. “We are deploying a two-pronged approach which includes prioritizing the wholesale channel and transforming our direct-to-consumer business model.” To shore up its wholesale channel and “bolster our relationships with our wholesale partners around the globe,” the company is working “to become increasingly less promotional in our DTC channels,” and helped drive gross margin expansion in Q4, he also said. Greben has “a strong track record of business transformations – ranging from deep turnarounds to high-growth strategies for a number of leading consumer brands,” the company said in a Wednesday press release. At Casper, he led the 2023 sale of the Canadian business and cut costs. He has also served as chief financial officer at various other companies, including Blue Apron, Ann Inc. and Quidsi, the Marc Lore-founded enterprise acquired and later shuttered by Amazon. In addition to its own branded merchandise, including Fossil, Michele, Relic, Skagen and Zodiac, Fossil has licensing agreements with Armani Exchange, Diesel, Emporio Armani, Kate Spade New York, Michael Kors, Skechers and Tory Burch. Fogliato said the company is making “progress toward achieving minimum royalty reduction with some of our long-time licensed brand partners who we continue to prioritize.” The company in February extended its agreement with Michael Kors, a partnership of some 20 years.

Title: Hims & Hers, Zealand, and Roche — why these weight loss drug stocks are down today

Several weight loss drug stocks are sliding today as pharmaceutical companies battle for dominance in the booming GLP-1 market — which is projected to hit $105 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (MS+2.92%) analysts. GLP-1 drugs, also known as incretin treatments, were made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+4.34%) Ozempic. They mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, fueling unprecedented demand. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+1.44%) currently dominate the space, but rivals are scrambling to carve out their share. Some companies, like Zealand Pharma and Roche (RHHBY+2.31%), are developing next-generation treatments with stronger weight-loss effects. Others, like Hims & Hers (HIMS+6.68%), betted on more affordable off-brand versions — an approach that thrived during shortages of branded medications but now faces stricter regulatory hurdles. Shares of Zealand Pharma and Roche fell 11% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday morning — just a day after popping on news of their collaboration to develop new weight-loss treatments. Zealand announced a partnership with Roche to co-develop and commercialize its experimental drug petrelintide, including a potential combination with Roche’s, CT-388. As part of the deal, Zealand will receive $1.65 billion upfront, with the total package potentially reaching $5.3 billion if development and sales milestones are met. Roche will handle commercial manufacturing and supply. “We now hold a more bullish view on the prospect of petrelintide emerging as an important therapeutic intervention for chronic weight management,” William Blair analyst Andy T. Hsieh wrote about the deal in a note Wednesday. Zealand previously reported that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost an average of 8.6% of their body weight. For comparison, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% weight loss over 68 weeks in clinical trials. Roche, a 127-year-old pharmaceutical giant, made its first major move into the weight-loss drug market in 2024, when it acquired Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. That deal brought in three obesity drug candidates, including CT-388, which showed promising results in early trials — patients lost 18.8% of their body weight on average after 24 weeks. Hims & Hers, the telehealth company catering to millennials, saw its stock drop nearly 5% Thursday morning. The company jumped into the GLP-1 market last May, offering compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic. The move paid off as Hims & Hers’ total sales surged 69% last year to $1.5 billion. But now, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that shortages of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound are officially over. With branded medications now deemed “fully available,” the agency plans to crack down on compounded versions that closely mimic FDA-approved drugs. Earlier this week, the FDA clarified its policies, giving companies like Hims & Hers until May 22 to stop selling compounded GLP-1 medications that are essentially identical to commercial versions. Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs.

Several weight loss drug stocks are sliding today as pharmaceutical companies battle for dominance in the booming GLP-1 market — which is projected to hit $105 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (MS+2.92%) analysts. GLP-1 drugs, also known as incretin treatments, were made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+4.34%) Ozempic. They mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, fueling unprecedented demand. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+1.44%) currently dominate the space, but rivals are scrambling to carve out their share. Some companies, like Zealand Pharma and Roche (RHHBY+2.31%), are developing next-generation treatments with stronger weight-loss effects. Others, like Hims & Hers (HIMS+6.68%), betted on more affordable off-brand versions — an approach that thrived during shortages of branded medications but now faces stricter regulatory hurdles. Shares of Zealand Pharma and Roche fell 11% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday morning — just a day after popping on news of their collaboration to develop new weight-loss treatments. Zealand announced a partnership with Roche to co-develop and commercialize its experimental drug petrelintide, including a potential combination with Roche’s, CT-388. As part of the deal, Zealand will receive $1.65 billion upfront, with the total package potentially reaching $5.3 billion if development and sales milestones are met. Roche will handle commercial manufacturing and supply. “We now hold a more bullish view on the prospect of petrelintide emerging as an important therapeutic intervention for chronic weight management,” William Blair analyst Andy T. Hsieh wrote about the deal in a note Wednesday. Zealand previously reported that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost an average of 8.6% of their body weight. For comparison, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% weight loss over 68 weeks in clinical trials. Roche, a 127-year-old pharmaceutical giant, made its first major move into the weight-loss drug market in 2024, when it acquired Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. That deal brought in three obesity drug candidates, including CT-388, which showed promising results in early trials — patients lost 18.8% of their body weight on average after 24 weeks.

Title: FAIR: ‘These Strikes Are a Good Example of Why We Shouldn’t Just Succumb to Despair’CounterSpin interview with Eric Blanc on worker-to-worker organizing

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. Janine Jackson interviewed Rutgers University’s Eric Blanc about worker-to-worker organizing as a key force of resistance for the March 7, 2025, episode of CounterSpin. This is a lightly edited transcript. The New Republic (2/13/25) Janine Jackson: The difficult and disturbing political moment is throwing some underlying fissures in US society into relief. Along with which side some folks turn out to be on, we’re learning what levers of power regular people actually have and how we can use them. And we’re reminded that the antidote to fear and confusion is one another, is community, including the particularly powerful form of community that is a labor union. Indeed, workers can wield power even shy of a union, though that’s not a story you will often read about in major media. Eric Blanc is a longtime labor activist and organizer as well as assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. He’s author of Red State Revolt: The Teacher Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics from Verso and, out this year, We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing Is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big from UC Press. He also writes the newsletter laborpolitics.com. He joins us now by phone from here in town. Welcome to CounterSpin, Eric Blanc. Eric Blanc: Thanks for having me on. JJ: Well, let me ask you to start with federal workers, who are, as we see, a primary target of Trump and Musk, but you remind us federal workers are also a key force of resistance here. Tell us about that. EB: It’s hard to exaggerate the stakes of the fight right now around federal workers. There’s a reason that Musk and Trump have started by trying to decimate federal services and decimate federal unions, and that’s because they understand that these are blockages on their attempt to have sort of full authoritarian control over the government and to be able to just impose their reactionary agenda irrespective of the law. And they know that they need to not just fire the heads of these agencies, but they need to be able to have a workforce that is so terrified of the administration that they’ll comply even when the law is being broken. And so they have to go out after these unions and break them. And in turn, the stakes for, really, all progressive, all working people, anybody who has a stake in democracy, are very high because this is the first major battle of the new administration. And if they’re able to mass fire federal workers despite their legal protections to have job protections, despite the reality that millions of Americans depend on these services—Social Security, Medicaid, just basic environmental health and safety protections—if they’re able to destroy these services upon which so many people depend, this is going to set a basis for them to then go even harder on the rest of society. So think about immigrants and trans people and all of that. So the implications of this battle are very high. It is the case, fortunately, that federal workers are starting to resist, but there’s going to need to be a lot more to be able to push back. JJ: Well, I grew up outside of DC. Both my parents worked at federal agencies. All of my summer jobs were at federal agencies, and anyone with direct experience knows that, with 0.0 illusions about perfection—but we understand that there are widespread misunderstandings and myths about government, generally, and about federal workers, specifically. Trump says, “We’re bloated, we’re sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job.” How do we push back against that narrative? USA Facts (12/19/24) EB: Yeah, I think the basic response is straightforward, which is to highlight just how important these services are and to note that, far from having a massively expanded bureaucracy, the federal services, like most public services, have actually been starved over the last 50 years. The percentage of the workforce that works for the federal government has continued to decline for the last four decades. And so it’s just not the case that there’s this massively expanding bureaucracy. And if anything, many of the inefficiencies and the problems in the sector are due to a lack of resources and then the lack of ability to really make these the robust programs that they can and should be, and oftentimes in the past were. So it’s just not the case that either there’s a massively expanded bureaucracy or that these services are somehow not important. The reality is that the American people, in some ways, don’t see all of these services. They take them for granted. They’re somewhat invisible. So the fact that, up until recently, planes weren’t crashing, well, that’s because you have federal regulators and have well-trained federal air traffic controllers. And so when you start to destroy these services, then all of a sudden it becomes more visible. What will happen if you stop regulating companies on pollution, for instance? Well, companies can go back and do what they did a hundred years ago, which is to systematically dump toxins into the soil, into water, and all of these other things that we almost take for granted now that are unacceptable. Well, if there’s no checks and balances on corporations, who’s going to prevent them from doing all of this? And so I do think that there’s just a lot of basic education that needs to be put out there to counter these lies, essentially, of the Trump administration. For instance, the vast majority of federal workers don’t live in DC. This idea that this is all sort of rich bureaucrats in DC—over 80% of federal workers live all across the country, outside of DC. And just monetarily, it’s not the case these are people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, they’re making decent working class wages. Overwhelmingly, you can look at the data. So we need to, I think, be really clear both of the importance of these services, but then also just to say it’s a complete myth that the reason that ordinary working class people are suffering is due to federal workers. It’s a tiny part of the federal budget, first of all, the payroll of federal workers. And if you just compare the amount of money that goes to federal workers to, say, the wealth of Elon Musk, there’s no comparison. Elon Musk, richest man on earth, has over $400 billion net worth. That’s almost double what federal workers, 2.3 million federal workers as a whole, make every year. So you just see the actual inequality is not coming from federal workers, it’s coming from the richest in our country and the world. JJ: Well, an arm we have, a lever we have, is worker organizing to push back against this, besides us at home being angry and throwing our shoes at the TV. We can work together and we have historical models, we have contemporary models and examples of how that can work and how that can play out. I want to ask you to talk about the 2018 teacher strikes, because I see that you have lifted that up as a kind of analog, that there are lessons to be learned about places like West Virginia and Oklahoma, red states that in 2018 had this strike by teachers that, against all odds, one would say, were popular, connected with community, and were, in their measure, successful. I wonder what you think some of the tactical lessons were learned there. What did we learn from those strikes? Jacobin (3/9/18) EB: That’s a good question, and I think it’s important to start by just noting that these strikes are a good example of why we shouldn’t just succumb to despair now. There’s an overall sense of doom and gloom that nothing can be done because Trump’s in power, but I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think it’s accurate that nothing can be done. And the example of the red state strikes are a prime indicator that even when you have very conservative people in power, in government, workers have an ability to use their workplace leverage and their community leverage to win. And so in 2018, hundreds of thousands of teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and beyond went on strike. Even though those strikes were illegal, even though these were states in which the unions are very weak, right-to-work states, and even though the electorates in all of these states had voted for Donald Trump, nevertheless they got overwhelming support from the population because they had very simple, resonant demands, like more funding for schools, decent pay for teachers, make sure that there’s enough money so that students can get a decent education. These things cut across partisan lines in a way that, similarly, I think that the defense of basic services like Social Security and Medicaid today really does cut across party lines. And the tactics, then, that they used were, well, first they had to get over the fear factor, because these were illegal strikes, so they had to find ways to start generating momentum amongst teachers. They did things like really basic escalating actions like asking people to wear red on one day. So they didn’t start by saying, “Let’s go on strike.” They said, “Can you do this one simple action together? Can we all wear the same color on a given day?” And then they asked the community to come in. They said, “Community members, can you meet us after school on this day? We’re going to talk about our issues together. We’re going to hold up some signs. We’re going to provide some information.” So they built with escalating action towards eventually a mass strike. And they used a lot of social media because they couldn’t rely on the unions as much. Social media was very important for connecting workers across these states, for generating momentum. And eventually they were able to have extremely successful walkouts that, despite being illegal, nobody got retaliated against. They won, they forced the government to back down and to meet their demands. And so I do think that that is more or less the game plan for how we’re going to win around Musk and Trump. You have to essentially create enough of a backlash of working people, but then in conjunction with the community, that the politicians are forced to back down. JJ: Well in worker-to-worker organizing, it seems like what you’re talking about here, I think a lot of us who have worked with organized labor or have that memory think of it as a top-down enterprise. And so worker-to-worker organizing is not just like a bright spot, something to look at, but a way forward, something that can be replicated. You direct something called the Worker to Worker Collaborative. Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about what worker-to-worker organizing is or how it’s different from a model that some folks may hold in their head? We Are the Union (UC Press, 2025) EB: Yeah. The basic problem with more traditional, staff-intensive unionism is that it’s just too expensive. It’s too costly, both in terms of money and time, to win big, to organize millions of workers. And whether it’s on offensive battles like unionizing Starbucks or Amazon, or whether it’s defensive battles right now, like defending federal workers, if you’re going to organize enough workers to fight back, there’s just not enough staff to be able to do that. And so part of the problem with the traditional method is that you just can’t win widely enough. You can’t win big enough. Worker-to-worker organizing is essentially the form of organizing in which the types of roles that staff normally do are taken on by workers themselves. So strategizing, training and coaching other workers, initiating campaigns—these are things that then become the task and responsibility of workers themselves with coaching and with support, and oftentimes in conjunction with bigger unions. But workers just take on a higher degree of responsibility, and that has been shown to work. The biggest successes we’ve had in the labor movement in recent years, from the teacher strikes, which we talked about, to Starbucks, which has organized now over 560 stores, forced one of the biggest companies in the world to the bargaining table. We’ve seen that it works. And it’s just a question now of the rest of the labor movement really investing in this type of bottom-up organizing. And frankly, there is no alternative. The idea that so many in the labor leadership have, that we’re just going to elect Democrats and then they’ll turn it around—well, Democrats are sort of missing in action, and who knows when they’re going to come back into power. And so it’s really incumbent on the labor movement to stop looking from above and start looking, really, to its own rank and say, “Okay, if we’re going to save ourselves, that’s the only possible way. No one’s going to come save us from above.” JJ: And it seems that it develops also with just a more organic, if I could say, understanding of what the issues are because it’s workers themselves formulating that message rather than leadership saying, “We think this is what will sell, or we think this is what we can get across.” It seems more likely to actually reflect workers’ real concerns. In These Times, 11/22/24 EB: Yeah, that’s right. I mean, workers are best placed to understand each other’s issues. They’re also the best placed to convince other workers to get on board. One of the things bosses always say whenever there’s a union drive or union fight is, “Oh, the union is this outside third party.” And sometimes there’s a little bit of truth to that. I don’t want to exaggerate the point, but there could be an aspect of the labor movement that can feel a little bit divorced from the direct ownership and experiences of workers. But when workers themselves are organizing, oftentimes in conjunction with unions, but if they really are the people in the lead, then it becomes much harder for the bosses to third-party the union because it’s clear the union is the workers. JJ: Right, right. Well, how much does it matter, for this kind of bottom-up organizing, whatever it is that’s happening at the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board]? What role—I don’t even actually know what’s happening, it’s in flux as is everything. But you think that maybe not that we shouldn’t worry about it, not that we shouldn’t think about it, but we shouldn’t over-worry about machinations at the NLRB, yeah? EB: Well, I do think that the Biden NLRB was very good and it helped workers unionize. So the fact that we don’t have that NLRB anymore is a blow to the labor movement. I think we just have to acknowledge that. That being said, it’s still possible to unionize. You don’t need the NLRB to unionize. The labor movement grew and fought for many years before labor law was passed. And even today it’s very ambiguous. The NLRB is sort of paralyzed on a national level, but on a local level you can still run elections. And so it’s not even completely defunct. And I think it’s probably still possible to use it to a certain extent. But the reality is that the legal terrain is harder than it was. On the other hand, the urgency is even higher, and you still see workers fighting back and organizing in record numbers. I’ve been really heartened by, despite the fact that the legal regime is harder, you’ve had some major union victories just in the last few weeks under Trump. For instance, in Philadelphia, Whole Foods workers unionized despite Trump, despite an intense union busting campaign coming straight on down from Jeff Bezos. This was only the second time Amazon—because Amazon’s the owner of Whole Foods now—has lost a union election, and that was just a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. And so it shows that there is this real anger from below. And I think that there’s something, actually, about the Trump administration, that because it’s so fused to some of the richest people on earth with the administration in an oligarchic manner, but then unionization itself becomes almost a direct way to challenge the Trump regime. Because you’re going up against both their destruction of labor rights, and then also, frankly, it’s just the same people are up top. The bosses and the administration are almost indistinguishable at this point. JJ: And I feel like entities like Amazon, like Whole Foods, have presented themselves as sort of the future of business, the future of the way we do things. And so I think labor actions, first of all, recognizing that it’s still workers doing this and it’s not happening in a lab somewhere, they just seem like especially important places to call attention to in terms of labor activity. Eric Blanc: “I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity.” EB: Yeah. And I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity, right? And the labor movement is the number one force that can do that, and force the politicians to show which side they’re on. Are you on the side of Jeff Bezos or are you on the side of low wage workers who are fighting back? Waging more and more of those battles, even if it’s harder because of the legal regime, I think is going to be one of the most crucial ways we have to undermine the support of MAGA amongst working people of all backgrounds. JJ: Well, and we need one another for that support as we go forward. Well, finally, unless you’re living in a hole or unless you actually like what’s happening, it’s very clear that business as usual isn’t going to do, kind of wherever you’re walking in life, we need to be doing something bigger, bolder. But we know that there are people, to put it crudely, who are more afraid of disruption than they are of suffering. Disruption sounds very scary, doing things the way they haven’t been done yesterday, even though we do have history that we can point to, is scary. And I think that makes the stories we tell one another and the stories we tell ourselves so important, the coherence of the vision of the future that we’re able to put out there is so crucial. And of course, that brings me back to media. You mentioned the importance of social media, independent media, just the stories that we tell, the stories that we lift up, the people that we lift up. It seems so important to this fight. It’s not meta phenomena. So I just wonder, finally, what you see as a role for different kinds of media going forward? Federal Unionists Network EB: Okay. I think it’s absolutely crucial. One of the reasons why the right has made the inroads it has is that it’s been better at getting its story out there and waging the battles of ideas through the media, through social media, and through more mainstream media. And frankly, our side has trailed. Maybe it’s because we don’t have the same resources, but I think it’s also there’s an underestimation of how important it is to explain what is going on in the world, to name who the real enemies are, and to provide an explanation for people’s real anger and their real anxiety about what’s happening. So yeah, I think it’s absolutely crucial. And I think we need to, as a labor movement, as progressives, as left, really push back and provide an alternative explanation that all of these problems are rooted in the power of billionaires. It’s not rooted because of the immigrants, not because of the federal workers, not because of trans kids. And I’ll just say that one of the things I find to be hopeful is that social media is being used pretty effectively now by this new federal workers movement, and I’ll give you one plug, which is that they have a new website, go.savepublicservices.com, through which anybody can sign up to get involved in the local actions happening nearby. It’s going to be a rapid response network to stop all of the layoffs that happen locally, wherever you live, and to save the services on which we depend. So people can go to that website, go.savepublicservices.com, and take advantage of that media opportunity to get involved locally. JJ: Alright then, we’ll end on that note.

Title: Twitch's CEO on its biggest competition, Big Tech's growth-at-all-costs mindset, and why Twitter isn't really a town square

Full Content:
Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology You have probably heard of Twitch, the company that basically invented livestreaming in the US, and that Amazon bought for $1 billion in 2014. Do you use Twitch? That's a different question. There are now lots of places to watch people do things live on the internet. And some streamers who really broke through on Twitch — like Kai Cenat, or Hasan Piker — spend a lot of time on rival platforms, too. No problem, says Dan Clancy. The Twitch CEO, who's been on the job for two years, says he thinks his platform offers streamers a way to connect with audiences — and, crucially, for audiences to connect with each other — that doesn't exist elsewhere. I had other questions for Clancy, like: When will Twitch actually make money for Amazon? And what happened to plans to port Twitch-like experiences to other places — like NBA games? And in a world where moderation is a political hot button, how does Twitch deal with streamers who talk for hours on end and are often likely to say something that will upset someone? We talked about all that in a recent chat, recorded live at South by Southwest in Austin. You can hear the whole thing on my "Channels" podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation. Hasan Piker, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, was recently suspended after making an extended metaphor about the healthcare system that involved killing US Sen. Rick Scott. He's been suspended multiple times. How do you get suspended at Twitch? Do you get involved when it's a high-profile person? Is this automated? How do you get reinstated? So first of all, the suspensions are not indefinite. They're there for a given period of time. Sort of a timeout. Right … to try to make sure people stay within the guardrails. If someone goes outside the guardrails a little, give them a little bit of timeout. So then [streamers know]: "OK. I'm going to work hard to stay within the community guidelines." We have a team that does that. It's not automated. I'll be aware of their decisions for certain high-profile [streamers]. But it's not my decision because the whole point is to keep some degree of separation. Even before last fall's election, we were seeing tech platforms rethinking moderation and rules, and they were moving away from moderation in some cases. Elon Musk led the way on that with Twitter. Now it seems like there's additional political pressure for platforms and media companies. How is that affecting Twitch? We were lucky in that we were not overly aggressive previously. I think sometimes, especially with misinformation and other things, people moved the line. And we had always consistently said, "Listen, you should be free to say what you want. It's how you say it. You can't be spewing hate. You can't be threatening violence … " But you could say, "I want to take ivermectin to deal with my COVID." Correct. We did have a policy [to deal with] someone whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation, but that doesn't really happen on Twitch. We don't have the viral spreading of information. More often than not, what people say on Twitch is a manifestation of what they hear through the other platforms. So someone might say, "Oh, I read a Facebook post the other day that said this." So you've always been sort of looser than some of the other platforms. And it doesn't seem like the Jim Jordans of the world are going after you and subpoenaing you and asking you to explain why you censored so-and-so. Is that because it's just a different platform? Is it because they don't know what Twitch is? No, I think it's because we have not been getting into that space. In general, we have not waded into censoring people. People talk about Twitter as a town square. Twitter's not really a town square because it just spreads all over the place. In a town square, you're either in the town square or you're not. And on a Twitch channel, either you're watching the channel live or you're not. If someone doesn't want to watch the channel, don't watch it. It doesn't algorithmically suddenly appear in their feed. You show up; you watch a channel. If you don't want someone watching your channel, you can ban them and stop them from watching your channel. In the pandemic, a lot of people discovered Twitch, and people spent a lot more time on Twitch. Then there was a rush from YouTube, Microsoft, Facebook to build their own version of Twitch. They offered huge contracts to some of the biggest Twitch streamers. Now they basically have all sort of retreated from that business. Their hope was, "I'll lose money on this creator. But all these users will come." But when that creator left Twitch, there was another creator ready to step up and become the next big thing on Twitch. They filled that void. And so [rival platforms] said, "No, this doesn't work. We're not really pulling [audience] from Twitch. So why do we want to keep losing money on these deals?" So you had deep-pocketed competitors that walked away. Does that mean they concluded they could never compete? Or did they decide this business is not worth it for them and they can get a better return doing something else? It's absolutely the case that the VOD business, like TikTok and YouTube, is a great business. You watch that when you have five minutes here, five minutes there, and you add up the five minutes … it's a great business. I mean, it's bigger than our business. Their thought was, "This will be on top of our business." And they still all do live. It's not like they pulled back from live. They've pulled back from signing money-losing deals. And when you pull back from that artificial injection of capital, Twitch, because it focuses on live, [streamers say]: "No, I'd rather be on Twitch." A while back Twitch was on the radar of media companies, and people like the NBA were saying they wanted their broadcasts to look more like Twitch. They had demos where there was a basketball game going on with all Twitch stuff on the side. It doesn't look like that ever took off. Is that media companies saying, "Actually, we're not really ready for a Twitch-like experience"? Is that the audience saying, "We're not ready for that"? I think it's people misunderstanding what is so special about Twitch. Let's take music. There's a ton of musicians on Twitch. And people said, "I know — we'll put music on Twitch. We're going to film a concert." So you take one concert and you film it. But then the creator isn't interacting with the community online. It's not distinctly different than what you can watch in a VOD, right? And it happens once. So the people are not building community among themselves. The musicians that use Twitch — they often use Twitch more to engage with their audience and community and doing whatever they do in their free time. The poster child example is T-Pain, who's a big musician who streams on Twitch all the time. I'll chat with him and hang out with him on Twitch, and he games on Twitch. He does his sound recording on Twitch. The point is, it's not about taking traditional music media and sticking chat next to it. That doesn't create community. That is just traditional premium media with people chatting alongside, which they already do on Twitter. Two years ago, you became the Twitch CEO. Then you had layoffs. Then you said Twitch wasn't profitable, which is why you made the cuts. It's kind of shocking to hear that between Amazon's resources and Twitch's cultural cachet that Twitch wasn't making money. Is it making money now? So I don't talk about where we're at now. But when you say it's shocking — it's not that shocking. Uber didn't make money until last year. Yes, but they were in a different business. And YouTube was making money — not right away, but … I was at YouTube from 2010 to 2012. For a long time, YouTube was not profitable. So I don't think it's that strange. I think this is an issue in the tech space, where there is this mindset of, "Build your organization for where you're going to be in three or four years." That came out of Google, in part because Google was lucky enough to have a money machine in the back of the house. So everyone else — it was like grow, grow, grow. Get a big team. Get a big team. And to be honest, part of what happened to Twitch, they kind of fell into that at Amazon. The Twitch team, when they first got there, they were very scrappy. And then people would come and say, "No, no, no, that's not the game here. You have to argue for more resources." And having been in Big Tech, that is the game: How do you argue for more resources? As opposed to: How do you figure out what is the number you need to serve your audience in your community? And so we were just like many other folks in tech. We were just not running the business as well as we could have. Jump to

Title: Ryan Breslow Settles Lawsuits After Returning As Bolt CEO: ‘I Made A Ton Of Mistakes’
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/03/13/ryan-breslow-settles-lawsuits-after-returning-as-bolt-ceo-i-made-a-ton-of-mistakes/

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin , Forbes Staff. Bolt's Ryan Breslow is back as the CEO of the payment startup he cofounded after a string of legal disputes with investors were settled. Bolt cofounder Ryan Breslow is back. Three years after he stepped down as the CEO of the payment startup, Breslow has now been reinstated after years of board room disputes, lawsuits, a SEC probe, and a crumbling valuation that tumbled 97% from its $11 billion peak. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes and the last few years were a very humbling experience for me,” said Breslow, speaking on stage at the Fintech Meetup conference on Monday. “I'm a warrior, but the last three years challenged me to my breaking point and beyond.” Part of Breslow’s comeback plan included a controversial $450 million funding scheme, announced last August, in which investors faced a 48-hour ultimatum to match their earlier investment or face 70% of their shares effectively being wiped out. Some of Bolt’s largest investors, Blackrock, Hedosophia and Untitled, sued to block it. But the plan is now effectively dead. Bolt has settled the suit, and will pay $3 million to cover its investors' legal costs. A temporary restraining order imposed as part of the legal action has also been lifted. In his Monday speech, Breslow defended his 2021 decision to take a $30 million loan secured against his shares in Bolt. The Bolt cofounder claimed in the speech that the loan was meant to run until the startup’s IPO but the board decided to call in the loan after he stepped back as CEO in January 2022. A dispute over how the loan was meant to be repaid led to the money being swept from Bolt’s bank account, Breslow firing three investor board members, and a lawsuit from investor Activant pushing for Bolt to be repaid from Breslow’s own shares. Bolt paid Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s shares in the startup were cancelled, resolving both the loan and the long-running court case. Bolt did not provide additional comment beyond Breslow's statements “I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in…I did it to be all in on Bolt for the long run,” said Breslow. Breslow said he had learned some lessons from the crises that engulfed his Amazon-style one-click payments startup, once valued at over $11 billion. Bolt offered to buy back shares from its investors at just a $300 million valuation in February before unveiling a fundraising round in August that valued the startup at $14 billion. “We learned a lot through the last three years of what doesn't work,” said Breslow. “I think I've come out of the experience of the last three years with a couple probably PhDs in law and governance.” The 30 Under 30 alum credits Bolt’s new board with helping him to weather several rounds of layoffs, investor disputes and now resolved lawsuits with major customers like Authentic Brands Group and sportswear maker Fanatics. “We needed to make sure our board was all in and once we finally got that right we were able to withstand the challenges,” he said. After removing investors like Activant’s Steve Sarracino and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi from Bolt’s board, Breslow hired several friends and associates like journalist Esther Wojcicki and crypto investor Brock Pierce, later replacing them with property developer Joel Schreiber. Court filings indicate that Bolt’s board is now made up of Schreiber, who is embroiled in a $100 million legal battle with real estate giant Starwood, and Breslow’s friend and music producer Larrance Dopson, and gaming entrepreneur Michael Carter. Bolt did not respond to a request to name its new board. “I didn't make the mistakes that I was accused of making, but I made plenty of other mistakes.” Bolt and Breslow have also churned through at least six major law firms over the last three years of legal battles. “You name a top law firm, there's a good chance we've hired them and even fired them or had them quit on us,” said Breslow. “Ultimately, we had to determine our own legal strategy…because of that, we were able to do things that a lot of law firms thought were impossible, find peace, find settlements, find outcomes that were really good.” Breslow was characteristically bullish on the prospect for Bolt now he is back at the helm, talking up deals with ecommerce website Revolve, Richemont Group and LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics. He also pushed the idea of Bolt expanding from offering a one-click checkout service for retailers to pushing financial products, crypto and peer to peer payments to the 80 million shoppers who have made a purchase using its platform — a so-called “super app.” British banking startup Revolut, which was valued at a $45 billion in share sale in August, seems to be Breslow’s inspiration. But catching up with the London-based company, which generated $545 million profit on $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, will take a lot of work from Bolt’s new CEO. Over the same period, Bolt recorded a $302 million loss on just $27 million of revenue.

Title: Two New Bosch-powered e-Bikes from Transition - The Regulator CX and SX
URL: https://www.vitalmtb.com/product/guide/e-bikes/transition/regulator-62656
Time Published: 2025-03-13T15:03:00Z
Full Content:
Transition released two new eMTBs that are essentially a motorized version of their highly praised do-it-all Sentinel V3. The 150/160mm-travel Regulator as its called, comes in a light and not-as-light version using Bosch SX and CX drive systems. Besides the 400wh vs 600wh battery capacities and differently powered motors, the Regulator SX and CX appear to be identical. But don't let the appearances fool you. While the nuances may be subtle, each front end is uniquely designed with different tube shapes, diameters and drive unit areas. Color options and component spec details aside, the other frame distinction is that the beefier CX features a geometry-adjusting flip chip while the more svelte SX does not. Vital has had a chance to swing legs over both bikes for initial test rides and each were exceptionally fun on the trail; a balanced blast to ride. The hardest thing to overcome, should you choose to mount up, may be getting Warren G out of your head every time you hop on your new bike. Regulator CX Regulator SX Both Regulators are offered in two trims — Deore at $6,999 and XT at $8,999. The Deore SX and CX share most of the same parts as do the XT SX and CX. While identical in many pieces of componentry, the SX and CX vary in forks, tires, wheels and cranks. The CX XT is the only model to offer Schwalbe radial tires, but the SX XT is the only build with carbon cranks (Race Face ERA). Both CX builds run 150mm cranks and 34t chainrings compared to 160mm and 32t on the SX bikes. We tested CX and SX XT builds which roll on different DT Swiss wheelsets. It should be noted that the new TRP Pro EVO brakes will come stock on the XT builds. Our test bikes had DH-R EVO brakes. If we're comparing the bikes head-to-head, the SX marginally wins in the value department (without factoring in motor and battery cost) due to the carbon cranks and debatably nicer wheelset (which may be splitting hairs). Both the Deore and XT builds, however, are in the premium price range at $7,000 and $9,000. The frame is full carbon, the RockShox suspension bits on our XT builds are top-of-the-line, the OneUp cockpit and dropper are home runs and though reliable and durable, some shoppers may scoff at a cable-actuated drivetrain on a bike in this price range. The size, fit and angle numbers on the Regulator are nice and classic with a touch of modern. As fans of sporty, playful bikes, this was refreshing for us with our size medium reach preferences landing in the 450-460mm range. Pair that reach with a 10mm-ish higher stack height than what's offered on the Sentinel and the Regulators are primed for action. Some of you long-bike lovers may be stuck wondering where to land with 25-30mm reach increments between sizes. The size-specific chainstays for S/M and L/XL keep the bike feeling even and balanced. They definitely did on our size medium. We kept the CX in the high setting throughout the test knowing consistently steep terrain was not in our immediate future. Why the SX doesn't offer a flip chip like its chunkier twin is a mystery to us and the lack of 29er rear wheel option on both bikes (especially on the SX) may be a deal-breaker for some. First Ride Highlights of the Regulator SX by Brad Howell For the past few years, the mountain bike community has been echoing the sentiment of “bikes are so good these days.” It’s not untrue, and as tired as you may be of hearing it, so are we tired of saying it. The gains as of late have been incremental, which has caused many (present company included) to hang on to our bikes rather than grabbing what’s new. While the e-bike segment has gotten pretty good lately, the SL category, in particular, has seen some pretty rapid growth and advancements. From this side of the handlebars, “peak e-bike” is one that rides most like a mountain bike. Many brands are crushing it, but it is nonetheless surprising when we get aboard a new bike that seems to be thaaaaat much better. Enter the Transition Regulator SX. The trouble with a March launch date is that the preceding months are typically cold and snowing in the mountains. That meant we only had a couple of rides with the Regulator SX to gather some initial impressions. Vital will have a proper long-term review dropping later this year. For now, take this first look for what it is. Initial Set Up Setting up the Regulator began with converting the wheels to tubeless, an otherwise often innocuous event. If you purchase direct from Transition, your bike will ship with tubes installed, but it does come with all the fixins to get it set up tubeless. When it's all said and done, you have a spare tube. I set the RockShox Super Deluxe Ultimate with 30% sag and left all the clickers in the neutral position. Sitting on the bike in the garage, it felt on the softer side, but with the Hydraulic Bottom Out and new air can, I wanted to see how it translated to the trail. The Lyrik Ultimate was set up for a 180-pound rider (10 more than I weigh) and still felt very supple during the cul-de-sac test. It’s fantastic to see Transition throw the longest dropper possible on a bike and then make use of the manufacturer’s travel reduction feature to let riders dial in their ride. In this case, the OneUp 190mm dropper post was a welcome sight and, even with a 30” inseam, had lots of post exposed when set to my correct height. Something that did not have to be changed was the spacer placement with the stem. With a 632mm stack height and OneUp’s 35mm riser bar, the Regulator’s front end was Goldilocks dialed out of the box. On the Trail On paper, the Regulator SX is a direct comparison to one of my all-time favorite e-bikes: the Devinci e-Troy Lite. They have the same motor and ride on the same suspension, although Transition does have the updated RockShox bits. With Transition's 15mm taller stack and nearly 1.5-pound weight cut, I was truly curious to see how the two line up. It’s going to take more than a few rides on winter trails to draw a direct conclusion, but I’ll say the Regulator SX is off to a banging start. The Regulator SX is a happy climber. The rider position is upright, and the seat angle keeps your weight where it should be, preventing a light front end or looping out. Utilizing the two lowest assist levels makes for a bike that scoots right up the hill while maximizing battery life. It is right on par with any of our experiences with the Bosch system. I tapped Boost on a particularly steep and loose climb, which the Regulator made short work of, showcasing what will hopefully be a trend of apt performance throughout the summer. The Regulator SX feels light and natural enough to ride with the motor turned off, a temptation I had not felt since testing the Orbea Rise nearly four years ago. I dipped my toes in the water at the trail center with my 5-year-old. Hardly a mountain bike ride, but I did raise my eyebrow a bit with the ease at which the Regulator handled the kiddie pump track. We’ll see if I can keep my hand out of the cookie jar on a real ride. Now for the sexy part: descending. With only a few rides on the local hill, I’m reticent to draw sweeping conclusions, but as it sits, the Regulator SX is intuitive and rides far lighter than the scales indicate. With the suspension on the more supple side, the bike still has a lively feel and is ready to make use of the terrain to pop over little jibs. These are sentiments typically thrown at 150mm trail bikes, not an e-bike, so yeah, we’re off to a good start. Whether you want to keep feet glued to the pedals or have a seat and throw a foot out, the Regulator is fabulous in the corners. I even got a few braps out of it. It may not (yet) be on par with the GasGas in terms of outright arc dominance, but wow, it’s up there. Much of this comes from an “in the bike” feeling that the taller front end and slammed seat create. That low center of gravity is no joke! I was able to find a few rocks to run over with the Regulator SX, and it made light work of those segments. The true test of its mettle will come as the steeper and boulder-strewn trails thaw out this spring. I would be surprised if the Transition didn’t hold its own, but won’t sign off until the moon dust settles. For now, I’ll say that we expect big things from the little purple machine from up north. First Ride Highlights of the Regulator CX by gordo I won't go into the setup detail like Brad as it is a very similar experience (30% sag, fork pressure a smidge higher than recommend and tire pressure 3psi higher compared with Maxxis I usually run). I will echo many of the points he made above, however. Even the full-power CX Regulator is an e-bike that rides with a feeling that's well below its 48-pound weight. Our CX with the bigger battery and stronger motor isn't even 6 pounds heavier than the SX, but it has a beefy RockShox Zeb fork and Schwalbe's impressive new radial tires which beg for hard charging. Climbing is a no-brainer in any mode as body position is nice and neutral. The 600wh battery can be taxed in Turbo for a fun couple hours of speed laps or it can be nursed for all-day epic rides. The chainstay lengths ensure the front wheel stays in the dirt during steep climbs with the powerful motor, yet the overall balance descending feels controllable and stable but lively. Brad says the SX hints at pedaling with the power turned off, but the CX does not. As a rider with a short inseam, and one who rides 150mm cranks on his personal pedal bike, the stock 150mm cranks on the Regulator CX were a welcome surprise. In high geo mode, pedal strikes should be a distant memory when pedaling chunky terrain. I fully recognize, however, that some riders may dislike the uber-short crank spec. On that same note, the inability to run a 29-inch rear wheel on either the SX or CX may chap some folks' hides, too. Between the SuperDeluxe with HBO and the 27% progression (3% more than the non-motorized Sentinel), the bottom of the bike was never met in conflict, even with multiple plops to flat on a local broken concrete trail. I wouldn't say the bike feels like it has more travel than it does, but overwhelmed isn't a word found in the Regulator's lexicon. In contrast to the bike's ability to handle abuse, it also flowed, cornered and cruised extremely well on mellower trails, and the traction provided by the Schwalbe radial tires was exceptional in rocky terrain. Brad and I (along with Steve Wentz on a Relay) rode together in Reno to wrap things up. At the end of the day, we hit the long, flowy, mellow-but-oh-so-fun Reno Vista trail on Peavine. The CX was not left behind because of heft or lack of agility. It popped, shimmied and rolled right along with the other lighter bikes, solidifying that trails of all varieties are on the menu for the CX. My mind went to straight to over-biking the CX. I confirmed with Transition that a 170mm fork would be acceptable and its ability to run a 205x65mm shock to get 160mm of rear travel sure sounds enticing. A full power system, travel bump and some DH tires? Expensive and unrealistic? Definitely, but... Our test is hardly long enough to reveal and significant issues with durability. Historically, Transitions have been solid and we see nothing out of the sync with the Regulators beneath us. Both bikes did have bolts on the cable guide covers near the head tube loosen up, and they were snugged up. We'll keep an eye on them to see if the bolts remain secure. The Regulator, in SX or CX trim, is an exceptionally fun and versatile ripper that rides less like an e-bike and more like a traditional mountain bike. Balanced geometry in a full-carbon frame with capable components and options for going light or beefy open up riding experiences in every direction for any type of rider. There's something to be said for simplicity and the Regulator ensures there ain't no need to tweak 213 different settings, so you can focus on where to ride on that clear black night under that clear white moon.

WEATHER ALERT Aamer Madhani Associated Press Published: March 13, 2025 at 8:39 AM Updated: March 13, 2025 at 4:50 PM Aamer Madhani Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Toronto residents Douglas Bloomfield, left, and his son Phoenix, right, who are on vacation in Washington, hold a Canadian flag and an ice hockey stick to show their support for Canada regarding trade tariffs as they pose with with another visitor to the city wearing a mask of President Donald Trump in front of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey. The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU. Recommended Videos But Trump, in a morning social media post, vowed a new escalation in his trade war if the EU goes forward with the planned 50% tax on American whiskey. “If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” Trump wrote. “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday that the EU trade commissioner would be having a phone call Friday with his U.S. counterpart. “We don’t like tariffs because we think tariffs are taxes and they are bad for business and they are bad for consumers," she said. "We have always said at the same time that we will defend our interests. We’ve said it, and we’ve shown it, but at the same time I also want to emphasize that we are open for negotiations.” The U.S. president has defined his opening weeks in the White House with near daily drama regarding tariffs, saying that taxing imports might cause some economic pain but would eventually lead to more domestic manufacturing and greater respect for America. The S&P 500 stock index fell 1.4% on Thursday, while European alcohol stocks also tumbled. But with the EU and Trump now tussling over alcohol tariffs, the impact of a trade war could surface directly in ways consumers could quickly see. It's unclear how the import taxes would be absorbed among vintners, distillers, brewers, distributors, retailers and consumers. Because of Trump's threat, a previously untariffed $15 bottle of Italian Prosecco could possibly increase in price to $45. Similarly, Europe's response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs means that the cost of a 30-euro bottle of bourbon in Paris could increase to 45 euros. Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, said before Trump threatened the tariffs on European alcohol, the spirits industry was already reeling from layoff announcements in the Kentucky Bourbon sector and the tariffs planned by the EU on American spirits. “This ongoing tariff war doesn’t just harm importers — it weakens domestic brands, disrupts distributors, and squeezes retailers who rely on global selections,” she said. “In the end, consumers will bear the brunt of it all." Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be “a hammer blow” for the sector. He said the U.S. market is worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually for French exporters of wines and spirits. “Not a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200% tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt,” Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With 200% duties, there is no more market.” As of now, Europe seems unwilling to back down. “Trump is escalating the trade war he has chosen,” Laurent Saint-Martin, the French delegate minister for foreign trade, said on X. “France, together with the European Commission and our partners, is determined to fight back. We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.” Trump's latest tariff threats suggested that even companies that have publicly stood by him could be collateral damage, raising questions about whether the wider business community would be willing to openly challenge a series of trade wars that have hurt the stock market and scared consumers who worry about inflation worsening. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of French luxury goods company LVMH, attended Trump's inauguration in January. His company's wine and spirits brands, which include Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Hennessy, could be subject to the retaliatory tariffs the U.S. president is seeking. The Italy-based Campari Group could also be hurt, after the White House highlighted it at Tuesday's press briefing for possibly opening a U.S. factory. Still, Trump feels aggrieved by the EU, complaining to reporters on Thursday about the lack of U.S. auto sales there as well as the lawsuits and fines filed against Google and Facebook parent Meta. “They are suing all of these companies, and they’re taking billions of dollars out of American companies,” Trump said. “And I guess they’re using it to run Europe or something.” Trump, in announcing the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Wednesday, openly challenged U.S. allies and vowed to take back wealth “stolen” by other countries, and he drew quick retaliation. He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging “reciprocal” rates starting on April 2. The EU announced its own countermeasures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was “applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,” or about $28 billion. Those measures cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. European Commission spokesman Olof Gill said Thursday shortly before Trump's announcement that the EU was "prepared for whatever might come, and we have been preparing for over a year.” “We call on the U.S. to immediately revoke the tariffs imposed yesterday, and we want to negotiate to avoid tariffs in the future,” Gill added. "They bring nothing but lose-lose outcomes, and we want to focus on win-win outcomes.” U.S. whiskey makers, meanwhile, encouraged Trump to broker a deal. “We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector," Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement. When Europe responded to Trump's 2018 tariffs with a 25% tax on U.S. whiskey, exports to the EU fell by 20% through 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Trump's separate 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico could put 31,000 jobs at risk in the sector. ___ AP writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Samuel Petrequin and John Leicester in Paris, Mae Anderson, Dee-Ann Durbin and Mike Warren contributed reporting.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) updated its bitcoin (BTC) miner price targets and estimates following fourth-quarter 2024 results and to account for changes in the bitcoin price and the network hashrate. JPMorgan raised IREN (IREN), its top pick in the sector, to overweight from neutral, and cut its price target to $12 from $15. The shares were 2.7% higher at $7.23 in early trade. Cipher Mining (CIFR) was downgraded to neutral from overweight, while the bank withdrew its $8 price target. The stock fell 3% to $3.10. The bank reiterated its overweight ratings on Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK), and reduced their respective price targets to $13 and $12. Riot slipped 0.5% to $7.82. CleanSpark gained 0.6% to $8.15. It reiterated its neutral rating on MARA Holdings (MARA), and cut the company's price target to $18 from $23. The shares rose 0.5% to $13.14. Miner's price targets were slashed by 19%-29% to reflect a 10% reduction to the bank's bitcoin price assumption and an 80% increase to the bank's network hashrate growth estimate. The total market cap of the five mining stocks that the bank covers has slumped more than 20% year-to-date versus a 11% decline in the bitcoin price, the report noted. Mining stocks have come under pressure as high performance computing (HPC) deals have taken longer than expected to come to fruition, and mining economics have deteriorated, the bank said. The pullback in these stocks offers an attractive entry point for investors, the report added.

His next venture may be hiring the workers laid off by Tesla (TSLA-4.63%) CEO Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Cuban has been reviewing pitches for a new business from former and current employees at the General Services Administration (GSA) and the White House, he told Politico. His eventual goal is to back some of those potential companies and help their workers leverage the skills they developed while working at the federal government as a contractor. “I think it’s possible to out-Elon, Elon, because the people he will bring in don’t know what they don’t know,” Cuban told Politico. The new venture would take former employees of the U.S. Digital Service, who served as an in-house consultant for federal agencies on information technology. The group was rebranded as DOGE by President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing Musk’s group. In February, 21 staffers said they would resign instead of helping DOGE slash federal spending, including through mass layoffs. Those employees, all of whom previously had senior jobs at tech giants like Amazon (AMZN-0.27%) or Alphabet’s (GOOGL-0.22%) Google, warned that the people Musk hired were political ideologues who lacked the necessary skills to carry out Musk’s vision, The Associated Press reported. Cuban would also enlist former workers at the 18F unit housed within GSA, which was charged with modernizing and building critical tech services for the government, including public-facing services like Login.gov and guides for federal and state agencies. The unit was dissolved on March 1. “A couple have a real chance to turn into small companies that can leverage their expertise,” Cuban told Politico, referring to some of the workers. Cuban envisions his tech company as profitable, although it’s unclear how that would be achieved. Federal agencies determine how much can be outsourced to the private sector and at what cost, and the Trump administration hasn’t shown an interest in remaking either 18F or USDS, according to Politico. 18F has also had a rocky history with finances. The unit fell millions of dollars short of its own revenue projections over its first three fiscal years and took home no revenue during its first year of operation, according to a 2016 report from the inspector general of the GSA. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer now leading Technology Transformation Services, told staff that 18F “was not and has not been fully cost coverable,” according to FedScoop. In fiscal year 2024, the program was $18 million short and lost $5 million in fiscal 2025. “Despite the losses the team was incurring, 18F with their recent hourly prices were on the very high end of the technology consulting market,” Shedd said. Cuban told Politico that the new company would have to generate private sector revenue in addition to federal dollars. It would also likely have to rely on state and local deals until a friendlier federal government is in place, a former 18F staffer told Politico.

March 13, 2025 09:04 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) groundbreaking enhancements to NVIDIA RTX™ neural rendering technologies. NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft to bring neural shading support to the Microsoft DirectX preview in April, giving developers access to AI Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs to accelerate neural networks from within a game’s graphics pipeline. Neural shading represents a revolution in graphics programming, combining AI with traditional rendering to dramatically boost frame rates, enhance image quality and reduce system resource usage. “Microsoft is adding cooperative vector support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April,” said Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D development manager at Microsoft. “This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.” In addition, NVIDIA RTX Kit, a suite of neural rendering technologies for game developers, is receiving major updates with Unreal Engine 5 support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair features. Enabling modders to create stunning remasters of classic games, the NVIDIA RTX Remix open-source platform officially released today. Plus, a new playable Half-Life 2 RTX demo featuring the latest neural rendering enhancements — such as full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and more — will be available on Tuesday, March 18. NVIDIA is also celebrating a major milestone with over 100 DLSS 4 games and apps now available. RTX Kit Arrives in Unreal Engine 5The number of triangles used to create games has increased exponentially over the past three decades. With the introduction of the Unreal Engine 5 Nanite geometry system, developers can build open worlds filled with hundreds of millions of triangles. As ray-traced game scenes explode in geometric complexity, however, the cost of ray tracing grows exponentially, making it impossible to achieve real-time frame rates. RTX Mega Geometry accelerates ray tracing of scenes with complex geometry, enabling developers to use up to 100x more triangles than today’s standard. RTX Mega Geometry is coming to developers from the NVIDIA RTX (NvRTX) branch of Unreal Engine 5. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs introduced RTX Hair, a linear swept sphere primitive that offers a major advancement for accelerating the ray tracing of hair and fur. Replacing typical triangle primitives, linear swept spheres more accurately represent individual strands of hair, improving image quality and performance in rendering realistic digital humans. RTX Hair is coming to the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 5. At the CES trade show, NVIDIA showcased neural rendering capabilities through its “Zorah” technology demo. At GDC, an updated Zorah demo built in Unreal Engine 5 features the latest advancements in neural rendering, including RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing and ReSTIR Direct Illumination. Return to ‘Half-Life 2’ With RTX DemoThe official release of RTX Remix — featuring DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, a host of new RTX neural rendering technologies and numerous community-requested upgrades — lets modders deliver stunning RTX remasters with even better image quality and higher frame rates. A year ago, NVIDIA released RTX Remix in beta, enabling remasters of classic games with fully ray-traced lighting, enhanced materials and the latest RTX technologies. Over 30,000 modders have since used the platform to mod hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods such as NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios’ Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX. Half-Life 2 owners can experience the capabilities of RTX Remix across the environments of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt by downloading a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo from Steam starting March 18. The remaster is being developed by four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Half-Life 2 RTX features full ray tracing, remastered assets, DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics. Over 100 DLSS 4 Games and Apps Out NowDLSS 4 was introduced with the release of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, receiving an incredible response from gamers and rapidly adopted by game developers. It is now supported in over 100 games and apps, reaching this milestone two years quicker than DLSS 3 to become the most rapidly adopted NVIDIA game technology of all time. DLSS 4 debuted Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering. This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and laptops enables gamers to max out visuals at the highest resolutions and play at incredible frame rates. In addition, Lost Soul Aside, Mecha BREAK, Phantom Blade Zero, Stellar Blade, Tides of Annihilation and Wild Assault will launch with DLSS 4, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience in each title.

Title: How Increasing Global Demand And Competition Are Driving The Edge Revolution

ByMark Mahle ByMark Mahle , Forbes Councils Member. Mark Mahle is CEO of NetActuate. The global race is on to build enough edge data centers to keep up with sky-high demand. The worldwide edge data center market is projected to reach $317 billion by 2026, a 107% surge since its $153 billion valuation in 2020, but this number doesn’t tell the whole story. Edge computing and AI are revolutionizing entire industries—from manufacturing and transportation to healthcare and retail—and these developments will likely result in trillions of dollars of true economic impact. U.S. business leaders can’t sit back and wait for the next chapter to unfold. Profound changes, driven by an increased need for computing power, advanced hardware, strategic investments and partnerships, are redrawing the global tech map and making it clear that we need to act now to remain competitive. AI’s exponential growth is only amplifying our need for robust edge infrastructure to support it. Even as AI models become more efficient, there is still unrelenting demand for AI that is better and faster. If a new model promises to perform 10 times more efficiently than the leading model, it won't be long until we want it to run 100 times faster. We're missing the forest for the trees if we think efficiency gains will slow our need for greater computing power. The new era of AI also requires substantial hardware resources. In 2024, Deloitte research estimated that total AI chip sales that year would account for 11% of the $576 billion global market: "Growing from roughly $US50 billion today, the AI chip market is forecasted to reach up to US$400 billion by 2027, though a more conservative estimate is US$110 billion." Nvidia is leading the AI chip market, but the industry is in an ongoing arms race for accelerated hardware performance. Nvidia originally designed its chips to enhance computer graphics, not power AI models, and startups are now creating chips specifically optimized for AI workloads. The power demands of AI are enormous and continue to rise. Due to increasing generative AI usage, "electricity consumption by data centers is forecasted to double to 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030," according to a recent Deloitte study. The tech industry, including giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, is rethinking its approach to meet these growing energy requirements by investing in nuclear technology. Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant that closed in 2019, is reopening after Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation. Nuclear energy must play a critical—and urgent—role in supporting future AI and edge developments. Based on reports from Goldman Sachs Research, “85-90 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear capacity would be needed to meet all of the data center power demand growth expected by 2030 (relative to 2023). But well less than 10% will be available globally by 2030.” China is executing an ambitious long-term strategy to be the world leader in AI by 2030. AI has the potential to add $600 billion annually to China’s economy. The Chinese government has invested heavily in a multipronged approach to AI and edge infrastructure innovation. China’s focus on AI ecosystem innovation, research and development and supply chain ownership extends all the way to the technology’s basic components, including mining and refining in-demand minerals necessary for building semiconductors. The U.S. tech sector is watching China with justifiable concern: The country’s immense domestic AI footprint is having a global impact. In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an AI model similar to ChatGPT called R1 and caused U.S. tech stocks to plummet. Nvidia's stock price dropped 17% in a day before starting to recover the following day. For tech companies in the U.S. and other countries in Europe and emerging markets, this is a pivotal moment. As business leaders, we have the opportunity to respond to China’s growth with both competitive investments and open-market collaboration. Mutually beneficial global partnerships with allies, such as EU countries and India, will allow us to align our interests, share knowledge, innovate and drive business outcomes. We need to stay competitive by building more self-sufficient, resilient supply chains and finding the right balance of technological innovation and regulation. This shift will require substantial collective investments in next-generation hardware, software, training and infrastructure. AI is reshaping every sector, and we are only beginning to realize its true economic value. The decisions we make now will enable our collective ability to flourish on a global scale.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. AXON Stock Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), best known for its taser and body cams for law enforcement agencies, has had a volatile ride, with its stock falling over 15% in a month, followed by a weakness in broader markets. The S&P500 index is down 8% in a month after the Trump administration’s tariff confirmation on its trade partners including Mexico, Canada, and China. Also, speaking of tariffs, see Trump’s Tariff Policy: The Ripple Effect On Alcoa And Metal Stocks. After its recent fall, AXON stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $560. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AXON stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AXON stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Axon Enterprise along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AXON stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Axon Enterprise has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 351.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 134.2 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 Axon Enterprise's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Axon Enterprise has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 30.7% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 32.4% from $1.5 Bil to $1.9 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 31.7% to $544 Mil in the most recent quarter from $413 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Axon Enterprise's profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Axon Enterprise's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $114 Mil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 5.9% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) • Axon Enterprise's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $298 Mil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 15.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Axon Enterprise's balance sheet looks very strong. • Axon Enterprise's Debt figure was $721 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $42 Bil (as of 3/12/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.8% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.2 Bil of the $4.0 Bil in Total Assets for Axon Enterprise. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 28.9% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) AXON stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AXON stock fell 44.8% from a high of $152.87 on 3 January 2022 to $84.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 November 2022 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $710.01 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $560 • AXON stock fell 40.8% from a high of $88.90 on 19 February 2020 to $52.61 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 1 June 2020 • AXON stock fell 85.8% from a high of $18.81 on 9 October 2007 to $2.68 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 February 2014 In summary, Axon Enterprise's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Weak • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AXON is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AXON stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Strike (STRK), the preferred stock issued by bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) has been listed for just over a month and is currently 3% higher than at its Feb. 5 introduction. Strategy's common stock, on the other hand, is 20% lower over the same period. Preferred stock like STRK can be thought of as a hybrid of equity and debt. Holders have a greater right to dividend payments than common stock owners if the company makes them and also to the company's assets in the event of a liquidation. STRK is a perpetual issue, which lacks a maturity date (like equity) and pays a fixed dividend (like debt). Those features mean preferred stock tends to be less volatile than the common stock. That certainly seems to be the case for STRK. According to Strategy's dashboard, STRK has a 26% correlation with MSTR and a slightly negative -7% correlation with bitcoin (BTC). It's also less volatile, at 49%, compared with bitcoin’s roughly 60% and MSTR’s volatility exceeding 100%. Last week, Strategy announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for STRK. That is, it's prepared to sell up to that amount of the stock at the current market price over a period of time. If all the STRK is sold, the company would face a total annual dividend bill of about $1.68 billion. Generating that amount of cash means the company would either to sell common stock through an ATM offering — unlikely given the depressed share price as of late —or use cash generated from operations or proceeds from any convertible debt raised. STRK offers an 8% annual dividend yield based on its $100 liquidation preference and at the currently price of $87.45, offers an effective yield of around 9%. As with debt, the higher the STRK price, the lower the yield, and vice versa. STRK also includes a feature allowing each share to be converted into 0.1 share of common stock, equivalent to a 10-to-1 ratio, when the MSTR price reaches or exceeds $1,000. Strategy stock closed at $262.55 on Wednesday, for the option to become viable it would have to appreciate significantly, offering potential upside beyond STRK’s fixed dividend. As an income-generating product with lower volatility, STRK presents a more stable option with potential upside. However, the massive ATM offering could impact this potential upside, similar to how ATM share sales have affected the common stock’s performance.

Ditto for my better half who will retire at the end of June. It better be there. I have paid into the system with every paycheck since I was 15 years old in the summer of 1971. Those who made Bernie Sanders impossible, twice, made Donald Trump inevitable, twice. The opener from from the Journal’s account: American consumers have had a lot to fret about so far this year, between never-ending tariff headlines, stubborn inflation and most recently, fresh fears about a recession. These concerns seem to be hitting spending by both rich and poor, across necessities and luxuries, all at once. Take low-income consumers: At an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago in late February, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said “budget-pressured” customers are showing stressed behaviors: They are buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month because their “money runs out before the month is gone.” McDonald’s said in its most recent earnings call that the fast-food industry has had a “sluggish start” to the year, in part because of weak demand from low-income consumers. Across the U.S. fast-food industry, sales to low-income guests were down by a double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to McDonald’s. Things don’t look much better on the higher end. American consumers’ spending on the luxury market, which includes high-end department stores and online platforms, fell 9.3% in February from a year earlier, worse than the 5.9% decline in January, according to Citi’s analysis of its credit-card transactions data. Costco whose membership-fee-paying customer base skews higher-income, said last week that demand has shifted toward lower-cost proteins such as ground beef and poultry. Its members are still spending but are being “very choiceful” about where they spend, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said. He said consumers could become even pickier if they see more inflation from tariffs. The Journal helpfully provides charts that show that the big Biden deficits did not translate into fatter wages: Later in the Journal’s discussion: The economy has seen pockets of weakness in recent years, but nothing that suggests such widespread weakness…. Several years of inflation—particularly on necessities such as groceries, rents and utility bills—have hit poorer Americans hard. But a strong stock market, buoyed by artificial-intelligence hype, kept wealthier folks spending. Recall how we have repeatedly featured analyses by Tom Ferguson and Servaas Storm that showed how depending groaf has become on the outlays of the richest cohort, to the degree that it was a big factor in stoking inflation. The Journal later took up this thesis. But now: This week alone, consumers have had plenty of new developments to digest. President Trump on Sunday declined to rule out a U.S. recession as a result of his economic policies, causing stocks to plummet. This was followed by yet another roller coaster of tariff threats, counter-tariffs and reversals. While Wednesday’s inflation data showed price increases slowing down slightly in February, that is cold comfort because it is too early to reflect the effects of Trump’s tariffs… Many also have less cold hard cash on hand. Checking and savings deposit balances across all income levels have declined over the 12-month period through February and are getting closer to inflation-adjusted 2019 levels… What this means is that consumers generally are less able to absorb shocks, just as uncertainty is soaring. It is hard to blame them for turning cautious, even if that means the economy suffers. So shorter: Mr. Market and the Confidence Fairy were keeping the economy chugging along, even if it was not widely recognized as a two tier enterprise. Now Trump has managed to whack them both, hard. Remember, a surprising trend since the crisis is the degree to which even the moderately to very wealthy would borrow against assets. Falls in asset prices put a hard brake on that as an additional booster. A new Axios story, Voters disapprove of Trump’s economic policies, polls show, explains why the public view of Trump’s schemes has soured: The big picture: The ramifications of Trump’s policies are already rippling outwards and impacting businesses and communities. Our thought bubble, from Axios’ Ben Berkowitz: Investors are beginning to realize the first-term “Trump put” — the notion that he’d change policy if markets reacted negatively — isn’t in evidence this time around. Recall that the mother of all shock doctrines, Pinochet’s 1975-1975 program, which unlike the Trump program, did produce some initial promising results, eventually led to damage so severe as to lead Pinochet to go hard into reverse.1 As we have seen repeatedly (particular tariff threats, the Ukraine negotiations, Trump ritually beating up on Bibi before shoring him up, Iran) Trump seems to relish making radical reversals simply because he can. But how much ego investment does he have in his tariff and Federal institution destruction program? He’s rhapsodsized so much about how wonderful it was in the great pre-electricity, barely-any-indoor plumbing Gilded Era that one can expect him to be far less responsive than he has on his other pet project. I’d like to see we’ll see soon enough, but we may not. ______ 1 From ECONNED: Chile has been widely, and falsely, cited as a successful “free markets” experiment. Even though Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s aggressive implementation of reforms that were devised by followers of the Chicago School of Economics led to speculation and looting followed by a bust, it was touted in the United States as a triumph. Friedman claimed in 1982 that Pinochet “has supported a fully free-market economy as a matter of principle. Chile is an economic miracle.” The State Department deemed Chile to be “a casebook study in sound economic management.” Those assertions do not stand up to the most cursory examination. Even the temporary gains scored by Chile relied on heavy-handed government intervention…. The “Chicago boys,” a group of thirty Chileans who had become followers of Friedman as students at the University of Chicago, assumed control of most economic policy roles. In 1975, the finance minister announced the new program: opening of trade, deregulation, privatization, and deep cuts in public spending. The economy initially appeared to respond well to these changes as foreign money flowed in and inflation fell. But this seeming prosperity was largely a speculative bubble and an export boom. The newly liberalized economy went heavily into debt, with the funds going mainly to real estate, business acquisitions, and consumer spending rather than productive investment. Some state assets were sold at huge discounts to insiders. For instance, industrial combines, or grupos, acquired banks at a 40% discount to book value, and then used them to provide loans to the grupos to buy up manufacturers. In 1979, when the government set a currency peg too high, it set the stage for what Nobel Prize winner George Akerlof and Stanford’s Paul Romer call “looting” (we discuss this syndrome in chapter 7). Entrepreneurs, rather than taking risk in the normal fashion, by gambling on success, instead engage in bankruptcy fraud. They borrow against their companies and find ways to siphon funds to themselves and affiliates, either by overpaying themselves, extracting too much in dividends, or moving funds to related parties. The bubble worsened as banks gave low-interest-rate foreign currency loans, knowing full when the peso fell. But it permitted them to use the proceeds to seize more assets at preferential prices, thanks to artificially cheap borrowing and the eventual subsidy of default. And the export boom, the other engine of growth, was, contrary to stateside propaganda, not the result of “free market” reforms either. The Pinochet regime did not reverse the Allende land reforms and return farms to their former owners. Instead, it practiced what amounted to industrial policy and gave the farms to middle-class entrepreneurs, who built fruit and wine businesses that became successful exporters. The other major export was copper, which remained in government hands. And even in this growth period, the gains were concentrated among the wealthy. Unemployment rose to 16% and the distribution of income became more regressive. The Catholic Church’s soup kitchens became a vital stopgap. The bust came in late 1981. Banks, on the verge of collapse thanks to dodgy loans, cut lending. GDP contracted sharply in 1982 and 1983. Manufacturing output fell by 28% and unemployment rose to 20%. The neoliberal regime suddenly resorted to Keynesian backpedaling to quell violent protests. The state seized a majority of the banks and implemented tougher banking laws. Pinochet restored the minimum wage, the rights of unions to bargain, and launched a program to create 500,000 jobs. Just like they brand Health care act under Obama as Obamacare, they need to brand this economy on Trump and coin a word-Trumponics sounds good. People need to know and more importantly make the connection of their collapsing 401K to Trump. Actually, Obama initially hated the term “Obamacare”. He later embraced it when the Dem-friendly media took to touting how it had reduced the number of Americans without health insurance…omitting that many found Obamacare policies to be so skimpy and costly as to make it a coin toss as to whether to stump up for them or not. Very true, what a racket. It should have been called RomneyCare, but no matter, the so-called ACA was another gift for the insurance oligopoly and could be considered a form of kleptocracy. https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/23/451200436/mitt-romney-finally-takes-credit-for-obamacare Massachusetts still has a health insurance mandate with tax penalties for those who don’t have insurance. It has a religious objection exception which I have used every single year, to not pay the penalty. The form is entitled Healthcare Information and is pages long making it the majority of pages of the “simplified” tax form (epic political fail) and requires input of very long policy account numbers and company identification numbers and number of months carried. I just completed my LAST Massachusetts income tax form and mailed to Massachusetts dept of Revenue. On it, I circled the “Healthcare Information” title on the form and wrote at the side of the page “You call this a Healthcare form but all your questions pertain not to healthcare, but insurance. Insurance is not care, and healthcare insurance is not healthcare. You should remove this title from this form and stop deceiving taxpayers.” Equally bad, as Stoller has pointed out, Obamacare caused massive consolidation as insurers worked around the medical loss ratios by simply buying hospitals and physician practices en mass. Fun times! Obamacare has truly been a complete debacle. Not for the insurance oligopoly. It is a gift that keeps on giving! So-called health care in the USA is a giant extortion racket. A great example of Kleptocratic Oligarchy Trumponomics . . . Trumpinflation . . . yes, it would be good to repeat those words millions of times in millions of places to get them into the general public brainfield. Maybe cute little trolls could make ” I did that” stickers featuring Trump’s face instead of Biden’s face, and go around sticking millions of them onto millions of packages of eggs. If it achieves nothing else, it would create jobs in the sticker industry. Saw a video news clip of Trump a few days ago where he stated America was going to be rolling in money from all the income derived from tariffs, would not know what to do with it all – rim shot …. And there will be rainbows, unicorns and cotton candy for everyone! We can always believe the promises of politicians, con-men, and snake-oil salesmen. It’s an American tradition Here is the instant rimshot sound effect button its very own self, in case anyone wants to use it. Of mafia dons , Trump is more Madonna ( US) rather than Mogilevich ( grand don of world crime syndicates, Russia). Out of his depth all round? Trump 720 degress round and round we go, reminds me of a scene in Flawless 2008. Michael Caine plays London Diamond’s janitor being interrogated by the insurance investigator (Lambert Wilson) of entire diamond inventory gone missing as Demi Moore (the only female company Manager repeatedly passed over in promotion) looks on. Growing exasperated with the investigator’s endless minutia questions, Janitor asks investigator in English understatement: “You sound like someone who’s looking for something. Perhaps if you tell me what it is, I could help you find it.” Well that was quick. Trump only had his Inauguration Day about 7 weeks ago and he has already succeeded into steering the US economy towards a ditch with the press shouting ‘Woop! Woop! Terrain. Terrain. Pull up! Pull up!’ Makes you wonder what he will do for the next 200 or so weeks. Trump has certainly done tremendous damage and created a lot of uncertainty but there are a lot of signs that the wheels were starting to come off the economy in November, December, and January. Hiring was slowing and inflation was being way too persistent. Trump has now thrown his brand of chaos into the mix and nobody knows what is going to happen next. The stock market is at an inflection point and might come back really strong if he gets his tax cuts passed cleanly. If he doesn’t , look out below and it’s going to be an ugly ride. The economy was looking a bit wobbly in the fall, but it looked in much worse shape back in 2022, yet no recession occurred. And most of the “persistent inflation” has been the housing index, which for various reasons the U.S. measures in such a way that it’s a lagging indicator. My understanding is if we measured housing costs like the EU, inflation would have officially been like half a percent lower – much closer to the 2% target. Gosh! I feel so much better knowing that things are not so bad if only we measured housing costs like the EU. By the way, how is the EU doing these days? Hooray, more tax cuts for oligarchy! That will surely boost the economy. We agree with Matt L. In essence, the “wheels have fallen off” in the US. Today, Ben Norton on X said, it looks as though Trump might be seeking a Reagan re-do with “The Plaza Accord.” Big item on the list “devaluing the dollar.” Back in the 80s, other countries agreed with Reagan to follow suit, but today, nations/investors think very differently. Has that occurred because more countries/investors are buying into Gold rather than using T-bills. We’re shootin’ in the dark here. Perhaps Yves could explain if and why there might be a new Plaza Accord, or is it too late for the US to do that?? Most Americans living through the second Gilded Age don’t remember, but the first one was replete with violence. Labor actions and protests were met with armed strike breakers and corporate militia massacres. The Pinkerton Detective Agency targeted labor organizers and fought pitched battles with strikers. Workers and Anarchists responded with bombings and assassinations. It’s ironic that Trump idolizes President McKinley, who was president during the first Gilded Age, and the beginning of the American empire, while Trump presides over the second Gilded Age and final chapter of the American empire. McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist. And while history doesn’t repeat, perhaps it rhymes? “Managed recession”, a phrase heard Tuesday from a true believer, lol. I’m waiting for “managed industrial collapse” lol A boy can dream 🥲 It won’t be managed. Oh, they may well manage it…. ;-) Manage to make it unmanageable? Pull the pit props and let the mine collapse. Meanwhile, Mark Cuban (a democrat and Trump critic, I believe) prepares to feast on the carcass of government agencies destroyed by DOGE: Oligarchs will feast, and they’ll feast, and they’ll feast, feast, feast, feast! It’ll be the US’s Yeltsin era. I don’t think Russians or anybody else will feel much pity. Indeed, dual-nationality carpetbaggers from across the world will likely going be flying in to get a piece of the privatization action. How ironic would it be if the Chinese and Russians got in on the action? Pretty sure dual-nationality Americans would be flying out of the country at the same with their looted fortunes to places safe from lynch mobs. Zuckerburg already has that mansion with the bunkers waiting for him in Hawaii and Thiel has New Zealand citizenship after spending only 12 days in the country- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/new-zealand-gave-peter-thiel-citizenship-after-spending-just-12-days-there Its all good in Hawaii until they decide to eat the zukes ala Cook. Did you ever have the Tall Poppy Syndrome in Aussie? It seemed really pronounced in NZ when I traveled there quite a bit in the 80’s. Thiel would be one mighty tall Poppy. Hawaii is not out of the country. Hawaii is a U.S. State. Maybe unhappy Hawaiians could start building and putting up huge official-looking signs: . . . ” Welcome to Hawaii! America’s Baltic State.” Well, the lege is looking to make Independence Day (Nov 28) a state holiday (SB 614). Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono Eggs. That foodstuff so symbolic in so many ways. Besides the economy, which I’ll muse about, Easter is coming up. Eggs at Easter are a thoroughly nonbiblical sign of lavishness, fertility, and renewal (along with bunnies, in the US of A). On BookFace after the election, a number of liberals were posting memes along the lines of, “Hah, the MAGAts sold their civil rights for a dozen eggs!” One immediately notices just how out of touch liberals are. No wonder the Democrats can’t win and can’t operate as an opposition. The egg represents several things that are now being pointed up in U.S. culture. Notice the guy at the refrigerator in the TwiXt? Here in Italy (and as I recall, in France), eggs are not refrigerated. The refrigeration is a clue that there is a problem in the U.S. food distribution system, one more foodstuff that is being abused. Recall the salmonella outbreaks. Recall that USonions can’t get a caesar salad with its traditional ingredient: a raw egg. I am not a big consumer of eggs: I use them to make savory tarts, quick breads, and cakes. But many of our fellow commenters mention that they eat the traditional U.S. breakfast: two eggs, sunny-side up. Italian eggs come in fourpacks and sixpacks. In the U.S., if you are going to eat the traditional breakfast, you’ll require a dozen. Price becomes a political issue. The U.S. Constitution indicates that the federal government is supposed to encourage manufactures and trade and productivity. One wonders what is coming apart in the pursuit of happiness. Hence: Eggs as a sign of deterioration in one’s standard of living, in the quality of food, and in availability of basics (like a doctor’s appointment). An egg shortage? In the land of amber waves of grain and fruited plains? It’s a symptom that I keep monitoring. Just as I monitored prices in Chicago in September 2024, when I went to a nice (but not fancy-shmancy) café that I once frequented only to find that an espresso coffee and plain croissant had risen to USD 9.18 $. That’s when I knew that Kamala Harris would lose. Eggs? Trump had better keep his eye on the egg. The reason eggs in the US are refrigerated is our bizarre production system. Eggs are somehow washed to remove a thin membrane….which keeps them from going bad faster! So in places with sensible practice, like Italy, Australia, and Southeast Asia, eggs in stores are not refrigerated and are good for about 3 weeks. Farmer & homesteader tip: if you don’t wash your eggs, they keep in the fridge for a couple months! However my hens produce so many my fridge would fill up entirely if I didn’t distribute them. When the collapsenik neighbor gives you free eggs during eggflation, you are more amenable to his crazy ideas… I am winning hearts and minds out here you wouldn’t believe Successful survivalism bestows personal credibility. And I think they’re good for longer too, if someone regularly flips them, or if waxed, or if coated in butter. Filthy US industrial agricultural practices, which also includes mistreatment of the animals, is the reason US eggs get washed, raw chicken carcasses are washed in bleach, dairy has to be pasteurized, and all the warnings about thorough cooking. Caged chickens lay eggs and poop in the same tiny confined place. Potatoes also last much long if they are NOT washed. In Mexican supermarkets, eggs are sold by the dozen, not refrigerated, but in smaller shops and the public markets they are sold by weight, again, unrefrigerated, and you can buy as many or few as you need. They are not inexpensive, and are at least as popular for breakfast as they are in Canada. Shells are very fragile and thin — and they taste better! I don’t know how to post a link here (and am a little wary of breaking the rules), but BIG by Matt Stoller has posted an amazing piece of the global control of the egg industry: Fowl Play: How Chicken Genetics Barons Created the Egg Crisis: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/fowl-play-how-chicken-genetics-barons?utm_campaign=email-half-post&r=15fy5x&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email That’s a great article for understanding what is/has happened to the egg industry fairly recently. I had never heard of egg barons before and having only two giant companies (not USA based) controlling the vast majority of egg/chicken production through sketchy genetic engineering practices was a revelation. Here on Oahu, Hawaii, most of our eggs come from California. There was a period of 3-4 weeks where they were pretty much unavailable but lately I see no shortage. Local Hawaii eggs are about $4 a dozen more expensive than mainland eggs typically. In 2016 I was lucky enough to visit Kauai. At the time the island was being overrun by feral chickens; we were told this was because there were no mongooses unlike there were on other Hawaii islands. Maybe the crafty little so and sos are better at hiding their eggs too. Easter egg hunt anyone? Maybe all year round. Does Kauai also retain more of its traditional legacy species of animals than the other Islands which have mongooses on them? If so, “feral chickens” might be a price worth paying to have more native species survival due to no mongooses. Eggs, rent and gasoline, all are easily cited as markers of runaway inflation forcing prices higher and many citizens of America to adapt into a less than optimal ( or sub-optimal, to quote CNBC anchor Jim Cramer ) spending and consumption for an overall healthy economy. At the very least, my latest rent renewal had a modest price increase, so the monthly rent is not increasing at the same pace from prior years. I’ll take a win where I can find it. Headlines a few weeks back were discussing if or how Disney might adjust or review their pricing packages for their park guests. These problems met the new administration when they walked in the door. And as referenced above it won’t be long until those ubiquitous stickers on gas pumps are perhaps showing up on egg cartons with a face switched out. Just as a general point, in parliamentary democracies on a 4-5 year cycle of elections, the notion of ‘getting the cuts in’ first is quite common – almost standard procedure. While actually engineering a domestic recession is unusual (although not unknown), its standard practice to dampen economic expectations for the first 2 years or so in the hope/expectation that there will be a later upswing – most politicians are well aware that most people don’t vote on the basis of absolute economic conditions, but on expectations – i.e. if people feel ‘things are getting better’ they will be more likely to stick to an incumbent, hence its rare for a government to lose out during an upswing (even if they were responsible for the ‘dip’ – people have short memories). This is probably what UK Labour is trying to do, albeit incompetently. This generally doesn’t happen in the US system because of the non-synchronous cycle of elections. But if you have a President who doesn’t really care about the mid terms, then this approach can make a certain amount of sense, especially if he is seeking rapid structural change. It doesn’t have to be a Pinochet type ideologically change – it may just be a calculation that there is a lot of deadwood and bubble in the system, and better to flush it out quickly, then use the following upswing to build in whatever new economic system you want. I suspect that Trump doesn’t really want a tariff based tax system, its just a short term way for him to shock the international trade system into the form he wants – i.e. one in which there is US onshoring and the US industry (not Wall Street) calls the shots. Also, worth pointing out that Isabella Kaminski is speculating that a recession is part of an implied deal with the tech oligarchs – an initial cutting down to size in favour of a longer term accommodation – exactly what we’ve seen in Russia and China. I don’t particularly agree with this, but it is an idea worth holding in mind. Some tech oligarchs seem to think this is what they’ll be getting: “Industrial Greatness Requires Economic Depressions” from Palladium, a Thiel mouthpiece. Thanks for the link. Some real doozies in there – I think everyone here will have a laugh at the assumptions. E.g. “While comparing GDP across centuries is necessarily a shoddy and incomplete affair due to poor data and the limitations of the concept of “GDP,” it is nevertheless a useful starting point. In 2021, the Medicaid program alone spent $7,593 per enrollee, or about $9,000 in 2024 dollars. This one social program provides the poor with roughly the entire income of an average Gilded Age American, to say nothing of the plethora of other social services and transfer payments which America is wealthy enough to afford today.” Who comes up with this stuff? As if “the poor” ever see a dollar of this money. People still don’t fathom that the rich, such as Thiel and Musk, don’t want more- they want it all. They think if we all live in Grafton, New Hampshire it will be a good thing. this is a deeply fascinating link. i’ve felt for a while that musk, thiel, and co are going to use the trump admin to sieze power, but i was expecting something a little more obvious, like government contracts suddenly switching from boeing to spacex. this article agrees with that, but implies that the trump admin is first purging their enemies via forced economic depression. purge then replace could be the overall strategy. but i dont know how good the implementation is going to be. the us would be in a very vunerable place during the transition time, and there could be consequences to that. ie, climate catastrophe coming in, and there being too much chaos to effectively deal with it. also. the article makes the big assumption that optimizing for innovation is a good thing. which, i am sure is true for some people. but plenty of people want to optimize for stability. what your values are determines what world you consider to be better. so like, eh. as a mere mortal i feel uncomfortable claiming what the ultimate best thing to optimize for is. instability is definitely good if you’re looking to seize power tho. “The US has no functioning democracy… an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery” When oligarchs openly call the shots, and free speech is legally equated with $$, how can one speak of “democracy” with a straight face? How obvious does it have to get? I think the outline of their idea is firming up. It is not an internal recession but an external one they seek. Seeing that the world is drifting away from the US they seek to transmit through the consumption channel a shock that will enable the US to regain a bit of its comparative advantage that it is losing. Ideas of re-industrialising the US will take decades and necessarily start with the technical education system which has dwindled away. These people have no patience and will not personally gain from such actions so seek to force overseas winners into the US in a manner they can personally profit from. First must come a change to budget making so that finances come before the spending not the other way around, otherwise deficits will continue. National infrastructure spending is the usual spur to industrial strength. And of course the ever present danger of GFC 2 requiring a $ 10 trillion dollar bailout with these valuations and extent of speculative activity. I think Trump and Bessent aren’t really afraid of an early recession (yet). It seems like Bessent may think the best way to draw down interest rates is a good ol’ recession. If you look at the amount of maturing government debt in the next 1-2 years, it’s a bit scary, and they may want to refi with better rates. Even though Reagan didn’t really “engineer” a recession, his administration suffered a bad one in 81-82, but by 84, it was “morning in America”. Hi PK. I suspect this is what Trump’s team is attempting. And you are right that usually in a 4-year political cycle it’s a very risky strategy. But I think they’re willing to run the risk. I can also cite two previous Administrations, both Republican, who did the same with success: Nixon and Reagan. Nixon was a political loner and didn’t care about his party in Congress, which were a distinct minority in 1969-70 anyway. Nixon as President basically made a deal with the Democrats who led Congress: I’ll sign your domestic agenda into law, you give me free reign and your support in foreign affairs. (That’s how we got the EPA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, etc., etc., etc.). I don’t recall offhand what happened in the 1970 midterms but the result wouldn’t have made much difference to Nixon’s presidency. Reagan certainly cared about his party in Congress, but like Nixon, they were far from a majority, although they did have a great deal of political organization and energy. Hindsight tells us that Reagan did have a knack for getting what he wanted out of the Democrats in Congress. On the economy, he had Nixon’s example from the previous decade, and a lot of Nixon’s key people (e.g. George Schultz) around him who knew just how to do it. They did it so smoothly that their timing was perfect for the “recovery” scenario you outlined in Reagan’s re-election campaign. I was in my teens at the time, but I do recall public perceptions about the economy shifting in early 1983. This strategy has become one Republican template. They don’t all use it, but as a party, it’s in their culture and some of them have learned how and when to try it. Trump is not only a businessman with a natural feel for big economic trends, he’s basically a lame duck. This compromises his political leverage somewhat, but in other ways gives him more range and freedom of action, not having any electoral consequences of his own to fear. Trump is following in the other non consecutive terms footsteps, in that the Panic of 1893 got going just before Grover Cleveland was inaugurated, and the years 1893, 1894 and 1895 are the rarest for US silver coins-as not many were minted on account of lack of demand in commerce when money was mostly silver. We’re gonna get there by other means to be determined, by our determined teetotalitarian leader. And a lot of the post election spending and maybe some of the debt accumulated, was perhaps from Americans who anticipated the tarrifs and were buying before those went into effect. Anecdote is not data, but several friends and relatives bought large ticket items just in case. Cars, cell phones, etc. I can confirm, anecdotally. that my sister is planning her spending on large ticket items and goods stockpiling in anticipation of the negative impacts of tariffs. As bad as the ‘70s economy was supposed to be there was never a shortage of eggs being flung at windows now and then. I still see some finance types saying that the master plan to manage the deficit is on track (lower rates, weaker dollar, and another goal that I forget) but even if true, the mid terms have to be at risk. Wait until the Trump promised elimination of taxes on tips and social security are “deferred” to a later bill while the Trump tax cuts are extended (I’ve seen early whispers about this). Just saw an email from my congress critter asking for constituents affected by federal cuts to contact his office. Signs of life in the Democratic party! I have been assuming that the midterm risk will be managed by not having free and fair elections. The SAVE act, armed thugs at polling places, etc. When squillionaires choose and fund the candidates, they don’t need to prevent the unwashed masses from voting. US elections are already neither free nor fair. Fighting Aliens in Aliens II: “What the hell are we supposed to use man? Harsh language?” Response of “constituents affected by federal cuts” … “Harsh language”? I believe that is what your congress critter might apply to counter Trump’s efforts toward economic collapse. I always assume the goal is fund raising. Thank you for this extremely convenient round up, Yves. I wondered if this might finally lead to a much needed separation of business and state, similar to separation of church and state. It would be nice, but I’m not getting my hopes up. An Amendment that establishes that money is in no way speech and that corporations are not people with any inherent rights would be a game changer. Amendment not required, and politicians who say otherwise are just trying to construct political cover. The spending=speech doctrine stands only absent any legislative or executive action. Faced with a strong enough challenge from either or both of the other two branches, the judiciary is checked. But they don’t even have to be checked if the legislature acts decisively on its own. Neither party in Congress has any intention of challenging the notion that spending=speech. It works to their distinct material advantage, so they prefer to make people think their hands are tied. They are not. The passage of an Act of Congress nullifying cases like Buckley and Citizen’s United would probably be enough by itself to overturn those decisions. And if the President were to sign it into law? The judiciary’s natural inclination is to defer to the legislative power, especially when joined in common cause with the executive. In other words, those Supreme Court decisions are only still relevant because of a policy vacuum which both parties in Congress help to maintain as beneficial to their own selfish interests. But what about all the campaign promises? https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/economy/trump-inflation-price-promises/index.html Now, the message is SFTU and get over it.

Trump made a fortune buying up distressed property in the 1970’s NYC malaise/bankruptcy and he’s been laundering money for oligarchs minted during the collapse of the USSR.

Tankus summarizes: “The pattern across my previous reporting, my current reporting, the reporting of others and this late-breaking FBI-EPA-Citibank situation suggest that the Trump administration is testing the waters in order to gain far greater control of the United States entire payments infrastructure- control great enough to bend Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s enemies to their will at a speed far faster than courts could ever conceivably contain.

Title: Rocket Lab Plans to Acquire Mynaric to Strengthen Space Communications Portfolio
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Plans_to_Acquire_Mynaric_to_Strengthen_Space_Communications_Portfolio_999.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:48:42Z

By integrating Mynaric's optical communications expertise, Rocket Lab aims to reinforce its position as a vertically integrated space company. The transaction is expected to bolster Rocket Lab's launch and satellite manufacturing capabilities while expanding its component supply chain. Rocket Lab may finance this and other potential acquisitions through equity offerings. Enhancing Optical Communications for Satellite Constellations The demand for cost-effective and scalable laser communication solutions has outpaced supply, presenting a challenge for satellite constellation operators. Rocket Lab has previously demonstrated its ability to scale satellite components to meet industry demand, and it plans to apply the same approach to Mynaric's optical terminals, ensuring wider availability and affordability. With an estimated acquisition cost of $75 million-significantly lower than the more than $300 million invested in Mynaric to date-Rocket Lab would establish a European base in Munich, Germany, integrating a workforce of over 300 engineers and specialists. This expansion would enhance Rocket Lab's European market presence and growth opportunities across its product and service lines. The acquisition would grant Rocket Lab access to advanced production assets, intellectual property, product inventory, and existing customer commitments for satellite-to-satellite optical connectivity solutions. This aligns with Rocket Lab's strategy to deepen vertical integration for manufacturing and future high-value satellite missions. Strengthening SDA and Government Contracts Mynaric has already played a critical role as a subcontractor to Rocket Lab, supplying CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals for Rocket Lab's $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA). This contract involves building 18 satellites for the SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric also supplies technology for other SDA projects, serving a shared customer base that includes commercial constellation operators, defense contractors, and government agencies. By acquiring Mynaric, Rocket Lab intends to scale production efficiency and enhance manufacturing capabilities, ensuring customers receive reliable and timely delivery of optical terminals for SDA and other missions. A Strategic Step in Rocket Lab's Space Vision Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck commented, "We have been very clear about this strategic direction for several years now - Rocket Lab is pursuing every part of the space value chain. We launch our own rockets, we build satellites in constellation volumes, and now we're closing in on the final step and most valuable part of the space economy - operating our own constellations to provide data and services from space using our newly announced Flatellite spacecraft. Mynaric has paved the way in developing laser technology. Their team and technologies will make a compelling addition to our satellite component portfolio and we look forward to making the technology available at scale for our own constellations and those of our customers." The acquisition remains subject to the completion of Mynaric's StaRUG restructuring and subsequent execution of a definitive agreement. Rocket Lab's initial purchase price is expected to be $75 million, payable in cash or Rocket Lab common stock, with an additional earn-out provision of up to $75 million based on future revenue targets. The final purchase price may be adjusted based on further investment by lenders in Mynaric before the deal closes. The agreement includes an exclusive negotiation period between Rocket Lab and the lenders, customary due diligence, and regulatory approval requirements. Mynaric is not currently a party to the term sheet, and Rocket Lab will not acquire any of its outstanding equity interests unless the restructuring eliminates them as planned.

The upcoming Electron mission for iQPS is planned for no earlier than March 15th NZDT. This will be swiftly followed by another Electron launch for Kineis, a global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider, during a launch window opening on March 18th NZDT. The "High Five" mission represents the final launch in a five-mission contract with Kineis. Through this agreement, Rocket Lab has deployed a complete constellation of 25 IoT satellites in under a year. Previous launches took place in June, September, and November 2024, as well as February 2025. The "High Five" mission will mark Rocket Lab's 62nd Electron launch overall and its fourth launch of 2025. Sir Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, highlighted the significance of this achievement: "Deploying an entire constellation to precise orbits on the customers' timeline in under a year demonstrates the advantages of dedicated Electron launches. Accomplishing this alongside another launch from the same site just days earlier underscores Electron's position as a leader in satellite deployment. We are honored to work with Kineis again to rapidly bring their IoT constellation online." Kineis Chief Technology Officer, Michel Sarthou, praised the collaboration: "This fifth launch with Rocket Lab marks a defining moment for Kineis: the completion of our constellation deployment in under a year. I applaud the dedication and expertise of the Kineis team, Rocket Lab, and all our partners in successfully overcoming this tremendous challenge together."

Title: BofA Goes Positive On Intel: Under Lip-Bu Tan, CDNS Stock Appreciated By 32x Vs. 16x Gains For SOX

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel has experienced a massive turnaround in sentiment over the past couple of weeks, first spurred by the Trump administration's purported exhortations to TSMC to get involved in Intel's struggling foundry division either via a technology transfer or by establishing an operational joint venture. More recently, the stock has received another boost, courtesy of the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as the CEO of Intel. Now, Bank of America's Vivek Arya is out with his take on this development, adopting an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards Lip-Bu Tan's appointment at the helm of Intel. To wit, Arya has now hiked his target for Intel shares from $19 to $25. For context, the stock is currently trading at the $23 price handle in early pre-market trading. Arya says that the analysts at BofA "really like the new CEO appointment," which becomes effective next week, citing: Of course, Arya does take pains to note the challenges that lie in front of Lip-Bu Tan: "The upside potential however is balanced against risks from a lack of AI roadmap and increasing competition from ARM-based PC and server CPU rivals, amidst a tough macro environment." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the ongoing flux at Intel has attracted a fair share of commentary from Wall Street analysts in recent days. For instance, when rumors emerged that Intel might spin off its fabs, BofA's Vivek Arya brilliantly laid down the scenario's cons, noting that splitting up Intel "could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC’s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC’s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC’s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO’s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC’s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield." Similarly, Lynx Equity issued an equally pertinent when it asked "why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel’s IFS" given the fact that global fab capacity "at leading and lagging nodes" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers "questionable performance at advanced nodes" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the "IFS’s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?"

In a nutshell: The FTC wants a judge to delay the agency's trial against Amazon over allegations it used deceptive marketing practices for its Prime subscription program. The reason for the request is that Elon Musk and the Trump administration's layoffs of federal workers has left the FTC short on employees and funds. The FTC said in its 2023 complaint against Amazon that the company knowingly tricks people into signing up for Prime through the use of "Dark Patterns," a reference to the number of options at the checkout suggesting people sign up for automatically renewing Prime subscriptions. It also alleged that canceling the subscription is a task involving multiple unnecessary steps, which could cause some people to give up before the end. A trial was due to begin in September, but FTC lawyer Jonathan Cohen has asked US District Judge John Chun to postpone it by two months. "Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment," Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday, via Associated Press. "We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team." Cohen confirmed to the judge that the FTC's resource challenges stemmed from the recent cuts made to federal government employees. Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has laid off over 62,500 federal workers since its inception. Cohen said some FTC employees had chosen to leave in January after DOGE's "Fork in the Road" email, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed employees to announce their resignation effective September 30, 2025. In return, participants would retain full pay and benefits until that date. Adding to the staffing problems has been the government hiring freeze, which Cohen said has prevented the FTC from replacing staff members who resigned for other reasons. Cohen said the FTC doesn't want to push the trial date back by more than a couple of months, but he still couldn't guarantee it would be enough time for the agency to address its issues. He couldn't even guarantee that things won't be worse by November. The FTC's legal team is "racing at considerable cost" to meet a late April deadline for discovery, Cohen said. It is also dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel. Amazon doesn't want the delay. One of its attorneys said most of the FTC's legal team assigned to the case were still employed by the agency, and that the FTC lacks grounds for a delay. Amazon denies it engaged in deceptive practices related to its Prime subscription service. If the FTC wins the suit, Amazon could potentially refund affected Prime customers.

Title: Could Netflix Stock Fall Over 60%?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. NFLX Stock Question: How would you feel if you owned Netflix stock and it dropped 60%, or even 70%, within the next couple of months? It may sound extreme, but it has happened before – and it could happen again. Netflix has stayed roughly flat this year after a stellar 2024, during which the stock gained roughly 90%, driven by the company’s crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming plan. However, we see several near-term risks for the company due to mounting macroeconomic concerns in the U.S., following President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on key trading partners and the possibility of lower subscriber additions for Netflix. We believe the stock could decline further to levels below $300 per share. Here’s why investors should be concerned. The fact is, during a downturn, NFLX stock could lose a significant portion of its value. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that NFLX stock dropped over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. So, is it possible for NFLX’s roughly $870 stock to fall to below $300 if a repeat of 2022 occurs? Naturally, individual stocks are more volatile than diversified portfolios – and in this environment, if you are seeking upside with less volatility than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Netflix’s subscriber growth could slow in 2025 as key initiatives—such as the password-sharing crackdown and the rollout of ad-supported plans—have already been implemented across major markets. These strategies likely accelerated demand from future periods, potentially leading to subdued subscriber additions going forward. The company’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 might indicate that it expects slower growth. See what to expect from Netflix in 2025. By the end of 2024, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber base close to 302 million. This expansion was a major driver behind the company’s stock price gains. Growth was driven by measures designed to curb password sharing, which required users either to pay for additional sharing options or to create new accounts. This initiative, now active in over 100 countries, helped Netflix both attract new subscribers and better monetize its existing base. Furthermore, the ad-supported tier—offering a more affordable entry point—has seen strong adoption, with over half of new subscribers in eligible regions opting for this plan as of the most recent quarter. However, with these growth drivers now largely exhausted, Netflix may face challenges in sustaining its momentum, potentially impacting the stock’s performance. Economic uncertainty could also weigh on Netflix, which is highly dependent on consumer spending. Trump’s aggressive tariff measures—including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration restrictions—have raised concerns that inflation might return. All of this suggests that the U.S. economy could encounter significant difficulties, and even a recession – our analysis here on the macro picture. On Monday, during an interview, the President did not rule out the possibility that new tariffs might trigger a recession, causing the Nasdaq index to fall by 4%. When taking into account the heightened uncertainty from the Trump administration’s policies, these risks become especially critical. The ongoing Ukraine–Russia war and global trade tensions further obscure the economic outlook. Tariffs increase import costs, leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This is clearly negative for Netflix, which relies on discretionary income. It also does not help that Netflix plans have become more expensive, with its premium plan now priced at $25 per month and the standard HD plan recently rising by $2.50 to $18 per month. This could result in subscriber pushback or slower new sign-ups. Meanwhile, Netflix’s content costs are set to rise as it expands into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling. Additionally, intensified competition might lead to higher churn rates or a slowdown in new sign-ups, ultimately impacting margins. These combined pressures could weigh on both profitability and stock performance in the near term. During some recent downturns, NFLX stock experienced losses that were slightly less severe than those of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. • NFLX stock dropped 72.1% from a high of $597.37 on 3 January 2022 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 February 2024 • Since then, the stock climbed to a high of $1,058 on 17 February 2025 and currently trades at around $890 • NFLX stock declined by 22.6% from a high of $386.19 on 19 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock dropped 55.9% from a high of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 At its current price of nearly $870 per share, Netflix is trading at approximately 35x consensus 2025 earnings, which seems somewhat expensive in our view. In contrast, the stock was trading at about 20x earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial performance has been robust, markets tend to be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the long term. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong record of subscriber additions and grow revenues at double-digit rates. However, there is a real possibility that subscriber growth may soon decelerate, as the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, while economic uncertainty in the U.S. grows. Given this potential slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you intend to hold on to your Netflix stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $300, $250, or even lower? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

Title: Tesla's Elon Musk problem

Tesla (TSLA) is struggling — and Elon Musk’s politics are to blame. “With great difficulty,” is how Musk described running his legion of companies on Monday, as more and more of his time gets devoted to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “I’m just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,” Musk told Fox Business (FOXA)’ Larry Kudlow of his pet project, which has been put to work overseeing massive cuts across almost every federal agency. The initiative approved by President Donald Trump, has garnered ill will from the very people who made up Tesla’s original customer base — Democrats. Between 2012 and 2022, about half of new electric vehicles were sold in the 10% most Democratic counties in the U.S., according to a working paper published in October 2023. A third went to the top 5% most Democratic counties. Musk’s years-long shift toward the right-wing irritated some of those customers, although the performance of Tesla’s EVs helped mitigate the damage. But that’s starting to change: in EV-friendly California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters. Just 13% of Democrats would consider buying a Tesla, according to a February Morning Consult poll. As of October 2024 — when Musk was known as a major Trump supporter and financial donor — Tesla’s brand value stood at $43 billion, down from $66.2 billion at the start of 2023. That’s back when DOGE was just a concept being talked about by Musk and Trump on the campaign trail. Now, however, protests are raging at Tesla’s facilities and showrooms. DOGE has courted controversy at every turn, drawing around two dozen lawsuits from groups looking to block its influence over the government, according to The New York Times’ tally. The group has taken credit for cuts that it did not carry out, aided in the removal of around 62,000 workers, and set the stage for the end of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That’s led to dozens of protests and rallies across the U.S. criticizing DOGE and Musk. That includes a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston over the weekend and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. “Tesla, I’m sure, makes fine products and we’re not interested in interfering with their business,” Alan Unell, a member of Indivisible Greater Vancouver, told KGW8. “They are a symbol of Elon Musk, and that is the reason that we are here — to fight against the symbol that is taking control of our government and destroying the democracy.” Although those protests have been peaceful, there have also been more than a dozen violent or destructive acts directed at the company’s facilities since Trump’s inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. In France, a dozen Teslas were set on fire near the city of Toulouse, France24 reported. And in Berlin, fires broke out at a construction site for the expansion of a Tesla factory. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a Wednesday research note. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Wall Street’s biggest Tesla bulls, has called on Musk to step up as CEO and warned that a lack of attention to Tesla will worsen the company’s brand image. Ives also noted that there has been “little to no sign” of Musk at Tesla’s facilities in recent months. A more present Musk could become a major asset to the company, according to some analysts. Tesla’s stock often fluctuates based on its CEO’s forecasts and comments on the company’s future. “Where he could become an asset is when he really steps back into the line,” said Dave Wagner, the head of equity for Aptus Capital Advisors and a Tesla investor. “Like let’s get Elon back on stage for Tesla to rile up some of the bulls here, because that’s what people buy Tesla for.” In response, prominent Republicans are calling for conservatives to support Tesla — one EV at a time. Grant Cardone, the finance guru who spoke at Trump’s October rally in New York, said he bought a new Tesla. Infowars creator Alex Jones announced a Cybertruck giveaway, while Fox News host Sean Hannity said he had picked out a Model S Plaid. “Get Starlink, Subscribe to [X] Premium, Buy a Tesla or buy some Tesla stock and hold it,” wrote conservative influencer Robby Starbuck, who has organized campaigns opposing diversity programs at major companies. “Whatever you can do big or small matters to fight back.” It’s unclear if that support will have a meaningful impact on Tesla’s sales, although one analyst said there are as many as 33.7 million potential Tesla buyers among Republicans. The GOP has always been a part of Tesla’s customer base but, overall, electric cars are more popular with Democrats. Seventy percent of Republicans now favor Musk and 64% of Trump voters favor Tesla, according to a recent survey from the EV Politics Project. About 63% of respondents who said they were “seriously interested” in buying an EV have a favorable view of Tesla. “I think Elon, by being an extremely high profile MAGA and defined by EVs, has loosened the chokehold a little, which could be the first step to an evolution,” CEO of the EV Politics Project and veteran GOP consultant Mike Murphy told Politico when the survey was published. “And if Elon put his shoulder into it, he could do a lot more” to help conservatives like electric cars. Tesla is also feeling the pain on the international level, taking hits in most major markets. Tesla is getting hit on “all facets of the company right now,” said Wagner, pointing to soft demand and supply. “You’re getting some of the irrational exuberance pulled back.” Tesla’s sales across Europe — including Norway and Germany — have sunk over the past few months, partially due to backlash over Musk’s political activities. Musk has brought controversy with his comments on foreign political affairs, including his support for the Alternative for Germany (AFD) in Germany’s recent election or Russia’s war against Ukraine. A rare outlier is the United Kingdom, which recorded a 42% surge in EV registrations for February. Tesla deliveries grew almost 21% year-over-year. Tesla’s Chinese shipments last month plunged 49% to 30,688 units, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. In the highly-competitive Chinese market, BYD (BYDDY) and other domestic firms are growing their share, buoyed by low prices. Several rivals also offer driver assistance software comparable to Tesla’s. The company last week delivered the Model Y Juniper, its update for the aging SUV, to its first customers. Downtime associated with retooling the four factories that produce the Model Y likely contributed, at least in part, to the company’s issues, according to analysts. Customers may have also delayed orders so they could get the refreshed SUV. That was Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Adam Jonas’ message to investors this week, as Tesla’s stock cratered. Despite a brief resurgence, bolstered by Trump’s support, shares traded more than 4% lower on Thursday. The stock has decreased by more than 37% since Jan. 1, wiping out the benefits of a massive post-election surge. Musk’s net worth has fallen by about $113 billion in 2025 as of Wednesday, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. “We see the pullback as a buying opportunity,” Jonas wrote in a note, reiterating his overweight rating and maintaining that Tesla is a top-pick stock. Jonas added that the company’s volatility may let his team test their $200 per share bear case, as well as $800 per share bull case within the next year. UBS (UBS) analyst Joseph Spak on Monday lowered his first-quarter delivery target to 367,000 vehicles from 437,000 vehicles, noting that his team believes orders are somewhat muted. Baird analysts now expect 369,400 deliveries for the first quarter. JPMorgan estimates 355,000 deliveries for the first quarter, down from a prior forecast of 444,000 units and Bloomberg’s consensus for 418,000 deliveries. But bulls still have a lot to look forward to, as long as Musk keeps his promises. Tesla plans to launch a ride-share service later this year, ramp up production of its Optimus humanoid robots, and begin making the autonomous Cybercab. Musk on Tuesday also announced that Tesla would double vehicle production at its U.S. factories. “This is the start of the biggest innovation and technology cycle in Tesla’s history ahead over the next few years,” Ives said.

The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds’ may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. RKLB and HIMS Risks: The Fund invests in swap contracts and options that are based on the share price of HIMS. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of HIMS even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. RKLB and HIMS are not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and are not involved with this offering in any way and have no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. Trading Risk. The trading price of the fund may be subject to volatility and could experience wide fluctuations due to various factors. Short sellers may also play a significant role in trading RKLB and HIMS potentially affecting the supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. Public perception and external factors beyond the company’s control may influence RKLB’s and HIMS’s stock price disproportionately. Performance Risk. RKLB and HIMS may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of RKLB and HIMS to decline. RKLB Aerospace & Defense Industry Risks. Companies in the aerospace and defense industry are subject to risks stemming from their reliance on government budgets and spending priorities, which can fluctuate due to political and economic pressures. The aerospace and defense industry is also affected by geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and regulatory changes that can impact market access and operational efficiency. Aerospace and defense companies typically rely on complex supply chains for specialized components and materials. Additionally, technological advancements are critical for maintaining competitiveness in this sector, but the high cost and uncertain outcomes of research and development efforts may pose financial risks. Companies in this industry face heightened cybersecurity risks due to the sensitive nature of their technologies, and breaches can lead to operational disruptions, reputational damage, and regulatory scrutiny. RKLB Business Risks. RKLB has experienced rapid growth, with its employee base and operations expanding substantially in recent years, placing considerable demands on its management, operational infrastructure, and financial resources. Continued growth is dependent on RKLB’s ability to scale its revenue, improve operational efficiencies, and maintain profitability while effectively managing its increasingly complex organizational structure. Additionally, interruptions from information technology failures, cybersecurity breaches, or other infrastructure issues could disrupt operations. RKLB’s ability to comply with applicable regulations and adapt to changes in the industry also presents ongoing risks. HIMS Healthcare Providers & Services Industry Risks. The healthcare providers and services industry can be significantly affected by changing economic conditions, evolving patient demographics, and fluctuations in demand for healthcare services. Changes in healthcare regulations and policies, including those related to insurance coverage and reimbursement, can materially impact the industry. Additionally, the industry faces risks related to litigation, operational disruptions, and evolving technologies that may alter traditional service delivery models. HIMS Business Risks. HIMS operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from established healthcare providers, retailers, pharmaceutical companies, and technology firms, which may affect its competitive position. Additionally, the success of HIMS is heavily reliant on its brand reputation, relationships with healthcare providers and medical groups, and compliance with complex healthcare and pharmacy regulations. Security breaches, data loss, legal proceedings, or regulatory changes could harm its operations and reputation. RKLX and HIMZ Fund Risks Leverage Risk. The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Security will be magnified. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. Daily rebalancing of the Fund’s holdings pursuant to its daily investment objective causes a much greater number of portfolio transactions when compared to most ETFs. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Markets for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural disasters, epidemics/pandemics, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the United States. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, leverage, imperfect daily correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from two times (200%) the Underlying Security’s performance, before the Fund’s management fee and other expenses. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk of the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades.

Cement is already suffering high incidence of taxes and duties. The imposition of new tax would adversely affect the cement industry in Tamil Nadu and make cement costlier at the hands of the end user.

Stock fell 1.38% on the NSE to ₹39.32. Caprize Investment, a smallcase manager expects a turnaround in the market by H2FY26.The current market correction/consolidation is likely to sustain as capital outflows continue over the next two quarters in absence of any new reforms. High-growth sectors with strong earnings visibility are likely to stabilize. As market estimates shift to FY27 post Q1 FY26 numbers, Caprize Investment- smallcase manager expects a turnaround post H2 FY26, with high-growth stocks looking attractively valued, setting the stage for the next earnings re-rating cycle. Liquidity and Valuation Trends Recovery in the market is dependent upon a major liquidity event. In past years, liquidity has indeed been plentiful; however, during the next two quarters, issues on this front will arise. Still, various high-growth stocks (25%+ year-on-year growth) are presently priced at 15-20x one-year forward multiples. When the market is consolidating, these multiple levels will begin looking more palatable on a FY27 base. Investment Themes Key Investment Themes and stock picks for 2025 include: Discretionary Consumption (Value Retail, Jewelry manufacturers, Mid/premium Hotels) : v2 Retail, Style Bazaar, Sky Gold, Samhi, and Kamat Ø Power (Transformers, transmission EPC) - TARIL, Shilchar, and Rajesh Power Ø Manufacturing/ Make in India: Garware Hitech and Vishnu Ø Renewables: INA, KPEL, and Shakti Pumps Ø Water Treatment: Ceinsystech The focus remains on Discretionary consumption, which comprises value retail, jewelry manufacturers, and mid-to-premium hotel chains. The power sector also takes center stage with a strong focus on transformers and transmission EPC projects. Also, niche manufacturing and Make-in-India will continue to gain advantage through government policies and domestic consumption. Renewables, driven by a robust backward integration theme, will offer selective investment opportunities. Data centers, too, will see sustainable growth levers due to enhanced digital infrastructure requirements. In addition, water treatment is gaining importance as the need for sustainable solutions and water infrastructure rises. Sectoral Performance: Bullish and Bearish Outlooks Sector-wise, some sectors are likely to lag behind because of numerous macroeconomic and sector- related issues. These are oil & gas, BFSI, auto, defense, railways, chemicals, consumer non-discretionary, and IT. On the other hand, discretionary consumption, power, manufacturing, renewables, data centers, and water treatment are likely to continue with growth and provide large-scale investment opportunities. Piyush Mehta, smallcase Manager and CIO at Caprize Investment says, “The changing market environment in 2025 holds challenges and opportunities alike. Short-term volatility can continue in the face of liquidity pressures and earnings normalization, but sectors like discretionary consumption, renewables, and niche manufacturing offer strong long-term potential. Strategic investors, prioritizing earnings clarity and valuation discipline, will be well equipped to ride out this fluid environment”.

IndusInd Bank Shares Today Live, IndusInd Bank Stock Price Live News & Updates: Shares of IndusInd were in focus today as it staged recovery after five straight consecutive fall due to a slew of negative events. IndusInd Bank has estimated ₹1,530 crore adverse impact due to discrepancies in derivative portfolio. RBI has stepped in to examine derivatives exposures of some private and state-run banks days after IndusInd Bank disclosed lapses in its derivatives accounting, a Reuters report read. The Reserve Bank of India has asked lenders for details of their overseas borrowings and deposits as well as their forex hedge positions, according to sources. IndusInd Bank on Tuesday fire fought the fallout of a Rs 2,100 crore discrepancy in accounting, saying it has enough reserves and capital to cover for it. IndusInd CEO and Managing Director Sumant Kathpalia said that the accounting lapse was noted around September-October last year and the bank gave a preliminary update to the RBI about this last week. The final number will be known after the external agency, which the bank has appointed, finalises its report by early April. During an internal review of processes relating to parts of its derivative portfolio, it has estimated an adverse impact of 2.35 per cent on its networth. The review was undertaken following RBI’s directions on the investment portfolio of lenders, issued in September 2023, relating to ‘Other Asset and Other Liability’ accounts of the portfolio.

Are there signs of stability emerging for Asian equities after the selloff on Wall Street in recent days? The recent sell-off on Wall Street has affected Global Equity Markets as the fallout and threat of potential trade wars take hold. Markets do not like uncertainty and when there are dangers and unknowns surrounding market conditions, we often see a move to safer, less risky assets. Asian equities are not immune to this as we have seen weakness across Indices such as the ASX with its strong links to Chinese trade, and concerns over how any trade wars could affect Chinese demand. With that said, the Chinese A50 has been relatively stable and the Nikkei has stabilised in recent sessions, as there has been an attraction to Chinese tech stocks and a rotation from US equities into international markets, including Asian equities, to take advantage of growth prospects and potential shifts in geopolitical relations. Tech advancements in China and potential stimulus from the Chinese government to support the Chinese economy can help protect Asian equities. Whilst trade wars and tariffs will no doubt impact Global economies, it is in no one’s interest to see the trade wars escalate, and I am sure there will be attempts to ease tensions and mitigate the impact of any potential trade wars. We are seeing a shift in Global investment strategies as we see rotation out of US stocks into the international arena including Asia to take advantage of the growth potential outside of the US, and this could also help support a rebound in the Asian stock markets in the short-term. With that said, the sustainability of any short-term rebound will depend on the longer-term impacts of the factors outlined above and in the current environment things can change very quickly. Any escalation of trade wars can have an immediate and sharp impact on the markets. With the way that the US administration communicates, this can happen unexpectedly and at any moment, so we must always be aware and remain dynamic with our strategies.

CPI cooled off further to a 9 month-low of 3.6% in February 2025. Month-on-month CPI fell by 52 bps in February. This was the fourth consecutive drop registered by CPI. Core CPI however rose to 4.0% (from previous month’s 3.7%), but is still at the RBI’s median 4% target level. A moderation in food prices has been the primary driver of the fall in CPI. After peaking out in October 2024 at 9.69% (YoY), Food & Beverages CPI has been dropping sequentially. February F&B inflation came in at 3.84% YoY, which is a significant drop, and also much below CY24’s average level of 7.6%. Month-on-month, F&B inflation contracted 1.64% in February, after already falling 2.43% in January. A significant drop in vegetable prices was the primary reason for the moderation in F&B inflation. This is the lowest level of F&B inflation in 21 months. The sharp drop in CPI is certainly a welcome development, as it provides more leg room to the RBI MPC in monetary easing. RBI has pivoted in the February MPC meeting with a 25 bps rate cut and is now looking to revive growth of the Indian economy. In the backdrop of tight monetary policy and high interest rates over the past couple of years as well as the prevailing global (geopolitical and trade) uncertainties, India’s GDP growth had collapsed from 9.5% a year back (Q3FY24, YoY) to 5.6% in Q2FY25, before recovering slightly to 6.2% in Q3FY25. RBI’s own projection for the GDP in FY25 and FY26 is around 6.6-6.7%, which is much lower than the 9.2% annual growth that the economy registered in FY24.

The stock traded flat on the NSE at ₹1,634.55 Gold prices edged higher as uncertainty over tariffs persisted, driving safe-haven demand, while a cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation print also supported bullion by strengthening expectations of rate cuts. Data showed that the U.S. CPI increased less than expected last month reported at 2.8% against the previous month of 3%. However, backdrop of aggressive tariffs on imports that are expected to raise the cost of most goods in the months ahead is keeping the overall inflation expectations higher in the market. President Trump early this month triggered a trade war, increasing tariffs on goods from China to 20% and imposing a new 25% duty on Canadian and Mexican imports, before dialing back and providing a one-month exemption for some goods that meet the rules of origin under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Trump also reversed course on a pledge to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada to 50%, hours after announcing the higher tariffs. Along with possible change in rate cut expectations, market participants will also keep an eye on US PPI data scheduled later today. Track IndusInd Bank stock price News & Updates here CPI inflation being at a 7-month low along with food inflation at its lowest since May 2023 together is a strong indicator of easing inflation and supply-side constraints getting addressed. This will help the RBI ease the rates further in the April policy meeting. A rate cut combined with ongoing liquidity measures will help boost system liquidity, thereby, leading to a pick-up in credit and consumption growth. Parallelly, this will bring much-needed relief to the food services sector with the lowered cost of raw materials and natural produce. Having said that, the need for an organised ecosystem to boost credit flow along with the integration of technology and AI into the agricultural sector is the need of the hour. Last but not least, we hope the rupee maintains its value so we don’t see inflation in oils and pulses.

Based on GIFT Nifty trend, Indian markets are expected to start the day on a positive note, with favorable economic data, including CPI and IIP, likely to drive the Index higher. In the case of BankNifty, after a brief dip below its strong support of 47,900, it bounced back sharply. We anticipate this upward momentum to continue towards 48,500, with 47,900 still acting as a solid support level. Tata Motors from the Auto sector remains a consistent recommendation, and another stock, Bharat Forge, is poised to break out from an Inverted Head and Shoulder Formation. In the FMCG space, Sugar stocks have gained traction, with Balrampur Chini breaking out from a Symmetrical Triangle Formation, and United Spirits is on the verge of a breakout from a similar formation. Stock-specific buying activity is also visible in the Pharma sector, with AuroPharma, Divis Labs, and Sun Pharma showing strong potential.

The CPI inflation declined sharper than expected to a seven-month low 3.6% in February 2025 from 4.3% in January 2025, appreciably below the mid-point of the MPC’s medium term target range, led by a welcome cooling in food inflation. However, we believe that the sequential uptick in vegetables inflation in March 2025 is likely to prevent a further softening in the food and beverages inflation print in the month, after the substantial cooling seen over the past four months. This would push up the CPI inflation print mildly to ~3.9-4.0% in the next month. Overall, the CPI inflation is now expected to average at 3.9% in Q4 FY2025, well below the MPC’s projection of 4.4% for that quarter. The Feb 2025 CPI inflation print falling well below 4% has cemented the expectation of a back-to-back 25 bps rate cut in the April 2025 MPC meeting. This may be followed by another 25 bps repo rate cut either in the June 2025 or the August 2025 meetings, dependant in large part on the next GDP growth print for Q4 FY2025. Nevertheless, we are apprehensive that tight liquidity conditions may delay transmission of policy rate cuts to bank deposit and lending rates. IIP IIP growth improved to a higher than expected 5.0% in January 2025, led by manufacturing and mining. The use-based data is less enthusing, with a sequential YoY pickup seen in only two segments (consumer non-durables and primary goods) amidst a slowdown in the other four. Reflecting the base effect related to the leap year in 2024, the YoY performance of most of the available high frequency indicators deteriorated in February 2025 vis-à-vis January 2025. ICRA expects the IIP expansion to moderate to ~3.0-4.0% in February 2025 (+5.6% in February 2024) from 5.0% in January 2025 (+4.2% in January 2024). It’s good news on both fronts; the CPI inflation has eased much lower than the 4%. The retail inflation has eased to a 7-month low at 3.61% vs 4.31% in January. The latest inflation print is also important as it shows that the decline in inflation has been durable. What is also good to read is the core inflation print at 4% and the most important Food inflation at 3.75%. Food inflation has remained sticky due to seasonality. On the industrial production front, the January IIP data stood at 5% vs 3.2% in December. The manufacturing output at 5.5% is encouraging as it reflects the upbeat mood at the factory level. Overall, the latest data sets the event for an April rate cut. The RBI had indicated that their future moves will be data-driven. Geopolitical tensions and a spike in crude prices and trade tariffs remain key risk factors. “Festive Cheer Boosts IIP Nov Growth to 5.2% Inflation Below 4%: RBI Easing Imminent, But Risks Remain “India’s retail inflation softened to 3.61% in February 2025, a significant 65 bps decline from January’s 4.26%, marking the first dip below the 4% threshold since August 2024. This decline strengthens the case for further monetary easing, as inflation now aligns with the RBI’s medium-term target. The sharp 222 bps decline in food inflation (to 3.75%) was the primary disinflationary force, the lowest since May 2023. Within food, vegetable prices contracted by -1.07% YoY (down from +11.35% in January) due to Kharif crops coming into the market, while pulses inflation turned negative (-0.35%), amid rabi harvest expectations. Fuel & light inflation remained in deflationary territory (-1.33%). While overall disinflation is evident, core inflation (ex-food & fuel) edged up to ~4%, suggesting persistent price pressures in certain segments. The biggest driver here was gold prices, surging 35.56% YoY, alongside rising health (4.12%) and transport (2.87%) inflation. With inflation now below the RBI’s 4% target median, another 25 bps rate cut in April is nearly certain, with a potential cumulative 50-75 bps easing by August 2025. However, global uncertainties loom—protectionist trade measures, commodity price volatility, and climate-linked food supply risks could disrupt the disinflationary momentum. The RBI must navigate this narrow policy corridor between supporting growth amid a negative output gap and preempting inflation volatility. This CPI print provides breathing space for monetary policy, but the next leg of inflation management will require precision, flexibility, and data-dependent recalibration rather than a one-way easing bias.” Headline inflation for February moderated to a seven-month low of 3.61% YoY, primarily due to easing food prices (-2% MoM), especially for vegetables, eggs, and pulses. Core inflation ticked up further, however, to a 16-month high of 4.2% YoY, mainly owing to higher gold prices. March CPI is tracking ~3.8% so far with food prices staying largely subdued. Core inflation is expected at ~3.6% in FY25E but is likely to be over 4% for the coming months, while we see FY25E headline inflation at ~4.7%. For FY26E, headline inflation is estimated at 4.3-4.4% (core: ~4.2%). A significant undershoot (40-50bps) in CPI for Q4FY25 will keep an April rate cut in play. However, global dynamics remain volatile, with their effect on FX to be watched. Inflation Below 4%: RBI Easing Imminent, But Risks Remain “India’s retail inflation softened to 3.61% in February 2025, a significant 65 bps decline from January’s 4.26%, marking the first dip below the 4% threshold since August 2024.

This CPI print provides breathing space for monetary policy, but the next leg of inflation management will require precision, flexibility, and data-dependent recalibration rather than a one-way easing bias.” “CPI fell to 3.61% in February 2025, reaching a seven-month low. This figure was below economists’ expectations of 3.85% and lower than the 4.26% reported in January 2025. The decline in CPI is due to a moderation in consumer food price inflation, which decreased from 6.02% in January to 3.75% in February 2025. The favourable harvest season is expected to further support this moderation in inflation. With inflation now around the target, this reading should strengthen the case for another rate cut at the upcoming RBI MPC meeting, as the focus is likely to shift towards boosting economic growth.” Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has launched the Bajaj Allianz Life Focused 25 Fund, a new ULIP-linked fund designed for long-term capital appreciation through a concentrated portfolio of up to 25 high-growth potential stocks, primarily in large caps. The fund, benchmarked against the Nifty 100 Index, follows a high-conviction, research-backed strategy to invest in fundamentally strong businesses with sustainable growth. The NFO closes on March 20, 2025. We are seeing a sharp and swift unwinding of the excesses and froth in the market which was built in FY24 and Q1-FY25. Valuations in certain pockets were factoring heightened earnings expectations, especially the cyclical portion of the market was being built for the long-term, which is seeing correction as earnings are getting normalised. We are seeing earnings cuts as well for the broader markets and hence a sharp fall where-in earnings are not measuring up to expectations. We are also seeing a period where in FPIs have been consistent sellers and there is heightened volatility due to global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Government spends and recovery in capex, interest rate cuts, recovery in consumption post tax breaks are key factors to watch out for. We reckon, amidst a growth slowdown, it is imperative to stick to investments that offer a structural long-term growth trajectory. Companies having good return profiles, good managements, healthy capital allocation capabilities and ability to capture the growth should be the preferred ones. We believe, India’s long-term growth story is still very much intact which can be very well played through the equity markets, though avoiding pockets of overvaluation and overestimation of earnings. The domestic markets are expected to open on a positive note on Thursday, as the domestic macro economic numbers were sprang positive numbers. Positive global cues will also aid market sentiment, said analysts. According to them, the consolidation phase will continue given the strong support at lower levels. Gift Nifty 22,555 signals a marginal gain. Analysts expect low-volume trading and profit-booking in the latter part of the day due to a holiday tomorrow on account of Holi. Retail participation will also be lower given the long weekend, they observed. Positive domestic and global cues boost market sentiment, with analysts predicting continued consolidation and low-volume trading. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply to 3.6% in February 2025, below market expectations of 4% and down from 4.3% in January 2025. The decline was primarily driven by easing food inflation, with vegetable prices turning negative for the first time in 20 months. With inflation trending lower than anticipated, the average CPI for the quarter is now expected to fall below the RBI’s initial projection of 4.4%. Easing food prices, coupled with lower global crude oil prices, have provided a supportive backdrop for inflation to align more closely with the RBI’s 4% target.Against this backdrop, the RBI, which recently cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and implemented liquidity measures to address the system’s deficit, is likely to maintain its easing cycle. The central bank’s stance is influenced by growing concerns over the economic growth outlook, given rising global trade uncertainties and the increasing prevalence of protectionist policies.

A Trump voter says he agrees with the president on everything but trans issues. Last weekend’s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian refugee﻿ whose green card was revoked over his involvement in demonstrations at Columbia University, is having a chilling effect on college campuses across America, where students say they’re being forced to think carefully before exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech.

In a Friday letter posted on the Department of Government Efficiency — or DOGE — X account , the Department of Education threatened to remove federal funding from public education institutions if the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives isn’t achieved by the end of the month. Days after federal immigration agents showed up to her apartment prompting her to leave the country out of fear she would be taken into custody, Ranjani Srinivasan is disputing the Trump administration’s account of her story. Personnel from the Department of Government Efficiency, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the US Institute of Peace Monday after being turned away last week. Michelle Obama will talk divorce, newfound freedom and friendship—but refuses to delve into politics—on a newly announced podcast with her brother, it was revealed Monday. The The New York Times disclosed the existence of the podcast, called IMO, which stands for “in my opinion,” and reviewed its first two episodes. The production, a video-led podcast, will be released to the public Wednesday. It features the former first lady and her brother Craig Robinson, who is the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. The pair talk about a variety of subjects, but sidestep politics and current affairs, instead opting for a lifestyle-themed format. Read more at The Daily Beast.

According to the Milwaukee Prosecutor’s Office, 20-year-old Kania was in a relationship with Sultan Shareef, a married man, since she was a teen. Kania and 54-year-old Sultan Sultan dated for years, and Kania fell in love.

Steve Bannon, former adviser to President Donald Trump, has cautioned the Trump administration against implementing cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing that a significant portion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) base relies on this program. In a recent episode of his "War Room" podcast, Bannon stated, "Get into Medicaid. Medicaid, you got to be here because a lot of MAGAs on Medicaid. I’m telling you, if you don’t think so, you are dead wrong. Medicaid is going to be a complicated one. Just can't take a meat axe to it, although I would love to." My wife and I are struggling to agree on tithing. She’s been attending church regularly for years, and while I respect her faith, I don’t participate. Recently, she asked to start giving 10% of our joint income to her church, which is a significant amount for us financially. I told her I’m uncomfortable donating that much to an institution I’m not involved with, and it turned into a heated argument. She says tithing is non-negotiable for her faith, and my refusal feels like a rejection of her values. I believe that many Floridians are bargain hunters when it comes to shopping for groceries or home goods. Everyone is different, of course, but it makes sense to try to save money on products that are the same no matter where you buy them. Examples of places where many Floridians will try to save some money are Target, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree. One more option is Walmart. And Florida will be getting a new one - via a $30.2 million project near a large new home development. Sharing my petty (but effective) HOA revenge story. For years, I lived in a neighborhood where parking in front of your own house was banned. I followed the rule grudgingly… until I got slapped with a $50 fine for a car I didn’t even own. The kicker? The car belonged to a random visitor parked briefly in front of my house. Regional offices assisting U.S. citizens with Social Security benefits are being closed by the Trump administration.

Credit: Jim Watson via TNS. This morning, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened college campus protesters with arrests and federal funding cuts. My husband recently left his tech sales job (no backup plan) and now insists I quit school to work full-time. I’m two semesters from a data analytics degree, with a Fortune 50 internship this summer—my only income source. Quitting school means losing the internship and future job prospects. Millions of people are under tornado watches Saturday morning as severe thunderstorms continue to stretch from Alabama to Indiana after a tornado outbreak overnight. It’s part of a major, cross-country low pressure system that has killed three people so far and pounded the central US with hurricane-force gusts. Buying a condo and dealing with renovations was exhausting enough, and now this… I've been so unlucky lately. I bought my place in December and registered with the HOA, only to find out they raised the fees starting February. I contacted the HOA and found out they notified the seller about the hike a few days after I signed the contract. But here's the kicker: none of this was disclosed in any of the documents I received. I’m starting to feel like the seller intentionally hid this from me. Does anyone know if the seller is legally required to give me all the disclosures before I signed? Feels like I just got blindsided, and I have no idea what to do next.😮‍💨 The chaos at the Internal Revenue Service began almost immediately after the first envoy from the Department of Government Efficiency arrived last month at the agency’s Washington, DC, headquarters. When I first sent my daughter to a U.S. preschool, I was shocked—no writing lessons?! But her teacher explained: “Writing is a skill, but expressing ideas is the superpower.” Audio of the 911 call made by a surviving roommate in the Idaho murders case reveals new details about the grisly night in 2022 when four University of Idaho students were murdered. Every time Congress faces a government funding deadline, Washington reminds itself — eventually — that shutdowns are worth avoiding. This is a familiar, and all-too-frequent, conversation. Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton told CNN’s Pamela Brown that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote to help Republicans avoid a government shutdown was “not standing up to Trump.” He also said his party needs to reform itself “to be in a better position to win.” A judge has entered an emergency protective order against former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin sought by his adopted son, Jonah Bevin, now 18, directing him to have no contact with Jonah until the matter can be heard in court. A Hous­ton-area woman was recently arrested “for providing illegal abortions,” the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a Monday news release.
