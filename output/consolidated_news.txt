October 1, 2025 3:00pm by Barry Ritholtz At The Money: The Flood of New ETFs (October 1, 2025) There will be nearly 1,000 new ETFs issued this year. Most of these are NOT the usual low-cost passive indices, but tend to be complex, expensive active funds in an ETF wrapper. These include leveraged directional bets, options, derivatives, and a whole raft of exotic strategies. Full transcript below. ~~~ About this week’s guest: Dave Nadig is President and Director of Research at ETF.com, and he shares with us how investors should navigate all of these new products. Dave helped design and market some of the first exchange-traded funds. He is the author of “A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds” for the CFA Institute.

And find the entire musical playlist of all the songs I have used on At the Money on Spotify TRANSCRIPT: Barry Ritholtz: There were 600 new ETFs launched in the first eight months of 2025. And it’s gonna get worse because so many more ETFs are coming out next year. The growth has been explosive. What does this mean for investors? I have the perfect person to discuss this with. Dave Nadig is president and head of research at ETF.com. He has been tracking the ETF industry pretty much since his its beginning and is well known as an expert in the space. So Dave, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on. Most ETF assets are and will likely continue to be cheap, index based products. That’s the legacy for investors: Low cost beta. Is this the future of ETFs or are we going in a different direction? Dave Nadig: I think most of the money is gonna continue to flow into low cost asset allocation targets, right? The S&P 500 broad bonds, broad commodities at very, very cheap institutional prices. It’s just hard to beat that. It’s one of the best deals going in asset management in the investing world. And so whether you’re an individual mom and pop investor just trading your own account, or whether you’re the Harvard endowment, anything in between. Cheap beta is still probably gonna be important to your portfolio, and ETFs are gonna remain the best wrapper for that experience. However, this industry is not gonna take that lying down and desperately wants to make money. Most of the new products, the new launches you talked about, the 600 will probably have 800, 900 by the end of the year. Almost all of those products are very expensive. Doesn’t mean some of them aren’t good, but they’re all very expensive. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about that. New products are coming out with what you described as quote, insanely high fees that the big revenue winners are likely not the firms you think of when someone says ETF at a cocktail party. What does this mean for investors? What does this mean for the industry? Are there really massive profits to be had here? Dave Nadig: There are pretty huge profits to be had here. And if you look at where I, I like to look at revenue based on flow. Meaning like last month, X amount of money came in, what was the revenue implied by that money and the implied revenue of the industry? Now has, you know, probably about 25% of the implied revenue from Flow is going to products that cost over 1%. (Really?!) So that means there are a lot of investors buying products that cost over 1%. And the reason that’s an issue for investors is not that nothing is worth that fee, but that what’s getting launched tends to be very speculative. We’re not talking about core investing, building blocks; we’re talking about ETFs that use leverage or ETFs that use the derivatives markets to shape your pattern of returns to get you more income than you might otherwise be able to, e.g., “Selling volatility” Those types of products are expensive and while they may be useful like, like a really sharp knife in the drawer can be really useful when you got that chicken bone you gotta get through. It’s not a one size fits all thing. I have some concern that individual investors see the marketing from the industry, which is really exclusively focused on those expensive products and gets sort of suckered into ’em. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what, what is transformative? What is innovative in ETFs over the past few years? What trends do you see shaping 2026 and beyond? What is the biggest new type of ETF that’s coming out? Dave Nadig: There’s really three buckets of, of hot development from a, from a what could you as an investor target. Crypto we have to talk about. Not only do we now have, um, hundreds of billions of dollars tracking crypto in various capacities, whether it’s spot Bitcoin, which is where most of those flows have gone, but now we’re talking about Ethereum and Solana. We’re talking about stake diversions where you’re taking your Solana and you’re putting it into a contract to earn fees off of or earn interest off of it. That ecosystem of crypto products is going to get very complex very quickly. The SEC has put out accelerated listing standards; default listing standards, which will allow probably the next 10 to 20 coins on the market cap list to be launched as spot ETFs. So those will all be launched within the next six to 12 months before you it gonna be a free for all Barry Ritholtz: Before you move off crypto. I have to ask about BlackRock’s Ibit – it was 5 billion at launch. It’s something like 82 billion already. Is this the fastest ever asset accumulator of any ETF that’s been launched? Dave Nadig: It’s pretty close if it’s not the winner. I, I certainly think on a, on a pure dollar basis, uh, I can’t think of anything that has had that kind of ramp. GLD when it first came out was one of the first to a billion and then the first to 5 billion, and that broke a lot of records. I think Ibit and Bitcoin as a class has really kind of blown all those things out of the water and it’s been, it’s been, I think, beneficial for the most part, and an orderly process. I think having these Bitcoin ETFs has helped investors understand it. Um, I’m hearing from bigger as bigger institutions, bigger advisors, they love the ETF because it solves all of their custody issues, right? Everything stays in the same account. They don’t have to worry about having on chain assets. So while crypto purists may not be into it, I think the average investor is way better suited to get their little bit of crypto exposure in that ETF wrapper. And, and you mentioned what the SEC is permitting, not just in crypto, but across the boards. I, I read your regular writings and one of the things you had said is. We have a “Incredibly permissive launch environment.” What does this mean in terms of the sort of things we can see in ETFs, either with leverage two x three x in verse two x? What, what does this permissive environment mean for what ETFs are gonna get launched? Dave Nadig: It means we’re gonna get a lot of ’em. We’re gonna launch “all the things,” as I like to say. (All the things!) Uh, the, the, the biggest thing we’ve had is this move towards single stock ETFs. And, and for people who might be confused by that, it’s not that you’re buying an Apple ETF to invest in just Apple ’cause you can obviously just buy Apple to do that. You’re buying an Apple ETF that maybe gives you two x Apple exposure or minus. Two x apple exposure. So when it goes, you goes down, you go up, or you’re writing options on your Apple position so that you can get some extra income. Or you’re doing a combination of both so that you can only get, you know, you get 2X the upside and minus 1X the downside but with caps involved, ’cause you’re selling a lot of options along the way. Anyway you can imagine mixing and matching these kinds of patterns of returns. The combination of leverage. Income and protection around a single stock is going to be launched. If you think about it, we’ve got 500 stocks in the S&P 500. There are about six different flavors you can think of for each individual stock. That’s a couple thousand ETFs we’re gonna have to keep track of, assuming there’s only one of each flavor, and this industry loves to compete against each other. Legitimately, I think by this time next year, we could have several thousand more ETFs than we do right now. Barry Ritholtz: More ETFs than there are actually stocks. Dave Nadig: Huge already. They’re absolutely, I mean, we’ve been under, we haven’t had 5,000 stocks in the Wilshire in a long time. I think 3,500. 500 or so. We’re gonna see all those single stock products, which are, for the most part, trading vehicles, right? If you’re a day trader, there’s lots of value in there. If you are trying to, you know, monetize a long term position, there’s some value in those kinds of covered call strategies. They’re all very expensive. They’re very inappropriate for most long-term investor from an allocation perspective, but sharp, useful trading tools for a certain class of trader. Barry Ritholtz: I keep reading some of the things you’re penning about share class relief. Explain what this means and why this is another flood of new ETFs that are coming out. Dave Nadig: Let’s pick an example. Like DFA Dimensional was late to the ETF party, very well known sort of in the nineties for being one of those shops where you could only buy them through an advisor who’d gone through their coursework. They made the shift to convert some of their mutual funds to ETFs a couple years ago, and were very successful at it. Now, why didn’t they convert all of them? Because a lot of the DFA products end up in 401k plans. And if you’re in a 401k plan, that means you need to be able to get fractional shares, which is really easy in a mutual fund and impossible in an ETF. The only way to get the efficiencies of the ETF structure into those mutual funds is a share class: an ETF share class pointing at the same pool of assets. That’s how a lot of Vanguard ETFs are built. They had a patent, which is now expired. The SEC has 70 odd applications from other players in the industry to basically duplicate things the way Vanguard does. They’ve made it very clear that. Imminent, I would suggest by the end of the year, at the very latest, we’ll see this first one’s approved and that will then be a flood because that becomes a very, very simple boilerplate piece of paperwork to file a new share class and get it trading on NYSE, Nasdaq, or CBOE. We’ll just see a lot of those. I would suspect by the end of the year, we could have maybe a thousand of those individual share class ETFs turned on if all of the people who have filed. Converted all or share classed all of the things they could. It would be about five or 6,000 new ETFs. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really intriguing. I have to ask a question, and you’re the one who’s really schooled me on this. If mutual funds were created today, they probably wouldn’t be approved. Explain the problem with mutual funds and why ETFs are arguably so much superior. Dave Nadig: Well, the biggest problem with funds is their tax fairness. It’s the issue with a fund is that if you as a big investor, let’s say you own 20% of the Dave Mutual Fund and you decide I’m terrible and you want out, well, the mutual fund me has to now go sell a bunch of securities to give you back your 20% of my fund all that cash that you’re gonna want. That engenders generally a bunch of capital gains. Those capital gains now have to be distributed to. All the people who were left, the people you abandoned buried, they end up paying taxes ’cause you left because you created a capital gain for everybody. Now it’s not that those are taxes that would never be paid, it’s just you’re paying them earlier than you would otherwise ’cause you get to reduce your basis. So. Individual investors in a mutual fund can often get tax distributions through no fault of their own, through no action of their own, simply because other investors go in and out in an ETF. That simply doesn’t happen. So it is a simply a fairer mechanism. The ETF also brings other things that are helpful, like the ability to wash out some cap gains by doing so-called creation redemption or heartbeat trading. That’s a little feature of ETFs that makes them very tax efficient. And of course liquidity and transparency and all those other things. But the big reason mutual funds would probably get the kibosh today is they’re inherently less fair in terms of how they treat individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: Even if I don’t sell my mutual fund, but other people have, I incur capital gains. Dave Nadig: A hundred percent. Now you get, again, you get to change your basis. So when you go to sell, you’ll pay less tax gains. But I don’t know about you. I prefer paying taxes later, hopefully never, or maybe after I’m dead. But not today. Barry Ritholtz: Final question. It sounds like the future of ETFs are pretty much anything. Anything you wanna do, sometimes cheap. Always very liquid, but can be accomplished very well with an ETF. Is this the future of asset management? Dave Nadig: I think so, I think the ETF structure is the most efficient vehicle we’ve come up with for taking exposures and getting them traded on exchanges. It’s hard for me to see how we’re going to make it any more efficient tokenization crypto. Sometime down the line, we’ll replace some of what we’ve done with ETFs, but we’ll largely duplicate it and it will just do it in a different fashion. The, the ETF structure is where you’re going to probably get almost all of your exposures for the foreseeable future with some very strange edge cases. Things like some private credit or maybe some real estate that you can’t trade daily. There’ll be some edge cases. Everything else is gonna be an ETF. Barry Ritholtz: If we’re talking about the future of ETFs, we’re really talking about the future of asset allocation and investing. For the most part, the big money is in the low-cost passive indexes that charge 3, 4, 5 basis points. But the fastest growing space in ETF-world are active funds. Our alternative funds are all sorts of niche. Areas, some of which are pretty pricey, a hundred, 125 basis points. Directional bets leverage two x three x inverse bets. Those are really special use cases. Tread carefully if you’re playing in those spaces. Use ETFs for what they’re really good at: Getting you low-cost exposure to inexpensive indices. Tread lightly when you go into the pricier, wilder stuff, those are potential accidents waiting to happen. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: Versant Lease at Former NY Times Building Occupies 164K SF

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Versant, Comcast’s corporate cable channel spinoff, signed a lease over the summer for a temporary home across 164,545 square feet at the former New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street, according to Savills’ third-quarter Manhattan office leasing report. The move, which occurred in August, marked a major milestone for MSNBC, which moved out of its headquarters and studios at NBC’s iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Adweek cited a memo to the company’s staff from Jeff Mayzurk, Versant’s president of operations and technology, saying that the new location, known internally at Versant as “summer camp,” was chosen “due to its studio and production space and its central location.” Despite this, Versant considers the move temporary, and is reportedly still searching for a permanent location. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unclear, as was the reason the new location will only be temporary. When the Martha Graham Dance Company moved to neighboring 1501 Broadway in May of this year, Crain’s New York Business reported that asking rents in that building started at $58 per square foot. It is unclear who the brokers were for the Versant lease, although JLL is the building’s leasing team, according to the building’s website. The owner of the building’s office portion is Columbia Property Trust. The building’s first four floors and two below-grade ones are retail-oriented and separately owned, having been purchased in August 2025 by Forum at Times Square for just $28 million, according to Crain’s New York Business. Ironically, an adviser on that deal, Jay Miller of BayBridge Real Estate Capital, told Crain’s at the time that the location’s appeal was enhanced by the possibility of a proposed casino right across the street. Those hopes were dashed two weeks ago, as CO previously reported. The building – which occupies 682,843 square feet, according to Property Shark – served as the home of The New York Times from 1913 to 2007. It received a landmark designation in 2001, and underwent an extensive renovation around 2011. CO reported in 2022 that BuzzFeed, seeking to cut its office footprint, relocated to 107,000 square feet in the building that it planned to share with its new parent company, Complex Networks. Both companies have since relocated again, with Buzzfeed shrinking its footprint further to 42,210 square feet at 50 West 23rd Street. Columbia Property Trust, Versant Media and JLL did not immediately respond to requests for information. Larry Getlen can be reached at lgetlen@commercialobserver.com.

Title: BlackRock Expands 50 Hudson Yards HQ by Another 194K SF

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy BlackRock has expanded its New York City headquarters to more than 1.2 million square feet. The asset management company has subleased an additional 193,573 square feet at Related Companies’ 50 Hudson Yards, according to a third-quarter office report from Savills. The sublandlord was Meta, which announced it was looking to cut about 250,000 square feet from its 1.2 million-square-foot office footprint at the Hudson Yards tower in December 2022. The expansion comes after BlackRock added more than 50,000 square feet to its headquarters at 50 Hudson Yards in July 2024, which brought its total footprint at the property to roughly 1.05 million square feet, as Commercial Observer previously reported. Now, following the latest expansion, BlackRock will boast roughly 1.24 million square feet of office space across more than 15 floors at the 77-story tower. The terms of the deal were unclear, but when 50 Hudson Yards opened in 2022, asking rents ranged between $175 and $240 per square foot. During the second quarter of this year, office rents in Hudson Yards averaged $153.52 per square foot, according to a report from Avison Young. JLL‘s Peter Riguardi, Matthew Astrachan, Joseph Messina and Hannah Bernstein brokered the deal. BlackRock declined to comment, while spokespeople for Related and JLL — which has represented BlackRock in past deals — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock signed its original lease at 50 Hudson Yards in 2016 for 20 years, with an initial commitment to occupy 850,000 square feet at the property, as CO previously reported. The asset management company has now far exceeded that commitment, joining the ranks of several high-profile tenants at the 2.9 million-square-foot office building. Those tenants include Meta, which leases space across 19 floors of the tower, and Truist Financial, which signed a deal for 100,000 square feet at the property in September 2022.

Title: Asset Management Interview Questions: How to Win the Generalist Olympics

If you’ve searched online for asset management interview questions, you’ve probably walked away disappointed. Yes, there are bits and pieces of information, but most “lists” are quite generic and gloss over detailed questions. Asset management interviews are like the “Generalist Olympics” because you need to know about a huge range of topics: The standard fit/behavioral questions, the firm’s investment strategies, economics and trade policy, valuation, equities and fixed income, general market knowledge, portfolio management, and more. The good news is that you don’t necessarily need to know a lot about each topic. The bad news is that it’s challenging to prepare because there’s no centralized place to learn about everything, and it’s much harder to “memorize” answers: One quick note before we begin: “Asset management” in this context refers to front-office work at firms such as Fidelity, Wellington, T. Rowe Price, and PIMCO. This means that you’ll analyze companies and entire sectors and construct portfolios for clients. “Asset management” does NOT mean wealth management, hedge funds, asset/liability management, or the commercial real estate kind of asset management (i.e., managing existing properties that your firm has acquired). Your clients could be either institutions or very-high-net-worth (VHNW) / ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals. But they should not be retail investors with small amounts to invest because that’s more like wealth management. Asset management firms want candidates with great academic qualifications (university name, GPA, etc.), solid internship experience in related fields (equity research, hedge funds, etc.), and the ability to work in a team and generate new investment ideas while managing risk. But there are very few entry-level openings each year (perhaps in the low hundreds or less), and the process is unstructured. You’ll go through the usual HireVue and phone/video interviews and then complete in-person final rounds, but there’s less of a strict timeline than in fields like investment banking. This means you need to prepare far in advance, as you won’t know the exact timing of each step in the process. The following topics are most important in AM interviews: Q: Tell me about yourself / walk me through your resume. A: See our guide and examples for the “Walk me through your resume” question and the article on how to walk through your resume in buy-side interviews. To give this more of an AM spin, talk about classes, student clubs, internships that are related to the markets and investing, and how working at this firm will let you focus on a certain strategy, sector, or geography you like. Focusing on team activities also helps. Q: Why asset management? A: You’ve always liked getting a big-picture view of the market and constructing entire portfolios based on individual companies and asset classes. You also like explaining your findings and rationale and understanding clients’ concerns, so AM is perfect since it combines client work and investment analysis. Avoid day trading references; focus on using classes, books, student clubs/activities, and relevant internships to explain your interest. Q: Why our firm/group? A: As always, you need to research the group beforehand, find a few “fact sheets” about their offerings, and link these into your answer (examples for T. Rowe Price): “I’m interested in your Dividend Growth Fund because it’s the perfect mix of ‘value’ and ‘growth’ investing. I focused on value in my previous hedge fund internships, but it doesn’t perform well in all market environments; this strategy is more robust and lets us shift the portfolio in changing markets and apply traditional value screens to high-growth companies.” Q: What are your strengths and weaknesses? A: There’s a full guide to this one. For strengths, you can cite points such as technical/analytical skills, communication ability, teamwork, and the ability to make quick decisions in response to market events. For weaknesses, you can discuss points like hesitating to give harsh feedback to teammates, sometimes not pushing back on inappropriate requests, or presenting too many options to clients. These questions test whether you can do the job: Q: How would you determine the optimal asset allocation for a client? A: You’d start by asking questions about their profile first: What their existing portfolio looks like, how much they have to invest, their liquidity requirements, their risk tolerance, any investment restrictions, and how much they need to live on (individuals) or fund their required obligations (e.g., pensions). Once you have gathered this information, you would start with the key constraints and then construct a portfolio to “bridge the gap” between what they currently have and what they should ideally have. For example, if a pension fund needs to make $50 million per year in employee benefit payments, you’d recommend a mix of bonds and dividend-paying stocks that would yield annual payments comfortably above that amount. After that, you would then assess the fund’s tolerated drawdowns and allocate more to bonds or stocks depending on whether it should accept more or less risk. Alternative assets, such as real estate and private equity/hedge funds, might also be allowed, but it depends on the client type. Q: Suppose that you are building a portfolio with allocations to many different asset classes. How would it be different if you were working at a pension fund vs. a university endowment? A: Both are subject to specific liquidity requirements and may have restrictions on their allowed strategies, securities, etc. The key difference is that endowments often plan longer-term and have a higher risk tolerance because they don’t need to make specific annual payments to retired employees; they simply need to grow their university’s assets over many decades. So, you might lean toward a more traditional stock/bond mix for a pension fund, but would be more likely to consider alternatives (real estate, PE/HF investments, etc.) for an endowment, along with a higher allocation to riskier assets. Q: A client’s portfolio just fell by 20% in the most recent quarter, and he is very upset with your firm. What would you do to calm him down? A: First, you’d listen to his concerns and spend time asking follow-up questions about his feelings, what he expected vs. what happened, and how this affects his real life. Then, you’d try to reframe the losses in a way that speaks to their concerns and mindset. This varies by client type and outlook, but a few examples include: Q: What is your investment philosophy, and how does it match ours? A: This one varies by candidate and fund, but here’s an example answer: “I understand that your fund focuses on ‘value with a macro overlay,’ so you invest in ~80% value stocks and then use other securities, such as precious metals ETFs, to hedge macro risk. I focused on value investing in emerging markets in my last role, which is quite similar because macro factors make an outsized impact there. Issues like a country’s borrowings in local currency vs. USD, its current account surplus/deficit, and commodity prices make a huge impact because many EM companies – even ‘value’ ones – are tied to exports and commodity prices. So, with every single investment recommendation I made, I always had to think about how to hedge the macro risk via derivatives and other investments.” Q: How do you manage risk in your portfolios? A: Entire books have been written about this topic, but one simple approach is to outline the key risk categories, such as currencies, interest rates, market, liquidity, and credit, and assign a “rating” for each one to each holding in your portfolio. You could then take a weighted average of these, see what the totals look like in each category, and rebalance accordingly. For example, maybe one client portfolio is overly exposed to interest-rate risk because of its allocation to long-term government bonds, but could afford to take more market risk; you might reallocate from bonds to stocks to get a more appropriate allocation. These questions are closer to the ones in investment banking interviews. But the interviewers will not go into nearly as much depth since accounting and valuation are just two of many possible topics: Q: Explain how the 3 financial statements link together. A: This is a classic question that is answered in the IB interview question article in Category #4. In short, the Net Income at the bottom of the Income Statement acts as the first line of the Cash Flow Statement. Adjust this for non-cash income and expenses, reflect the Change in Working Capital, and then record cash inflows and outflows from investing and financing activities. Cash at the bottom of the CFS equals the Beginning Cash in the period plus all these changes (Cash Flow from Operations, Investing, and Financing), and this becomes the ending Cash number on the Balance Sheet. Link the non-cash adjustments to their corresponding BS line items, make Net Income flow into Equity, and link the CFI and CFF line items to their corresponding Balance Sheet lines. Q: Walk me through how to move from EBITDA to FCF and explain how FCF is used in valuations. A: We have a whole tutorial on EBITDA to FCF, so see that for the details. In short, FCF = EBITDA – Net Interest Expense – Taxes +/- Other Non-Cash Adjustments +/- Change in Working Capital – CapEx. The tricky part is that this specific “type” of FCF is rarely used in valuations because it’s more of a credit or financial statement analysis metric. You tend to use Unlevered Free Cash Flow in a DCF because it ignores capital structure; UFCF excludes the Net Interest Expense and bases the Taxes on EBIT rather than Pre-Tax Income. Q: Explain the relationship between valuation multiples and a DCF model, and when you might rely more on one or the other. A: Unsurprisingly, we have another tutorial on valuation multiples. Essentially, they’re a “condensed” form of the DCF that expresses similar information (cash flow, future growth rates, and risk) but in a single number rather than an entire analysis. Common examples are Enterprise Value / Revenue, Enterprise Value / EBITDA, and P / E or Equity Value / Net Income. Valuation multiples are normally supporting tools in a full company analysis; they are shorter and easier than detailed projections, but also less meaningful. However, if a DCF is not feasible because the company is too speculative, does not yet generate revenue, or has other major issues, you might rely more on multiples. Q: Explain the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and how it affects valuations. A: See our tutorial on the WACC formula. This CAPM model says that a company’s Equity, Debt, and Preferred Stock have “expected” or “required” rates of return, and you can estimate the overall Discount Rate by taking a weighted average of these rates. You then use this Discount Rate in a DCF model to value the company based on its future cash flows. When the required rate of return is higher, the company’s implied value is lower (and vice versa). Q: Why does a DCF for individual companies matter if your job is to construct portfolios of 50 – 100 assets for clients? A: Single-company DCFs matter less in this context, but they can still be helpful for “sanity checking” the valuations in different sectors. For example, if Big Tech is overvalued, DCF models for all companies in the sector will probably point to similar results. So, you can often run quick analyses that give you a rough idea of valuation levels based on representative companies in the sector. And yes, you could use simple EBITDA or P / E multiples as well, but the DCF often gives you a more accurate reading (if executed correctly). In nearly all AM interviews, the interviewer will ask you about metrics such as the S&P 500 closing price and the 10-year government bond yield to assess how closely you follow the markets. However, they will also expect you to have a view on where the markets are headed. To stay up to date, it helps to read the weekly “Market Commentary” updates from various banks and AM firms: BlackRock | T. Rowe Price | Barclays | JPM | Citi Q: What’s the S&P 500 at? What about the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the prices of oil and gold? A: You can view all of these on the homepage of the WSJ each day, even without a subscription. If you’re in Europe or Asia, substitute in the major indices in your market, such as the FTSE 100 or the Nikkei and Shanghai Composite. Q: Where are the equity markets headed? Why? A: There is no “best” or universal answer for this one, and also no way to judge whether your answer is correct. But “better” answers tend to have more data supporting them, while “worse” answers are based on vibes rather than numbers: “I expect the overall U.S. market, represented by the S&P 500, to remain stagnant over the next year (vs. a ~14% YTD increase) because the companies with the largest weightings in it are valued very richly, and once some of the AI hype moderates, their share prices may not perform as well. It’s already at a 24x forward P/E vs. 25- and 10-year averages of 20x. Political instability, such as the government shutdown, and the inability to rein in the deficit will also weigh down stock prices. International markets, which are up roughly ~25% YTD based on VTIAX, should continue to outperform over the next year, perhaps in the 10 – 20% range, due to the falling USD and much lower P/E multiples in the ~15x range. Several non-U.S. developed markets have also hinted at fiscal stimulus, which could boost asset prices as well.” Q: Which sectors will benefit the most and be hurt the most by rising inflation? A: The most vulnerable sectors are ones with low margins that cannot easily pass on price increases to their customers – something like low-cost retailers might count (yes, they can increase prices, but their customers are very price-sensitive). Anything that is more defensive, viewed as a “necessity,” or has prices that are locked to inflation in some way, will tend to do better. Examples might include certain healthcare or utilities companies or consumer staples. In this category, bond questions are much more likely than currency and commodity questions: Q: Explain the yield to maturity (YTM) and duration of a bond and how you use them in portfolio management. A: The Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the annualized return an investor will receive if they buy a bond at its current market price and hold it until maturity, assuming the company makes all the required payments, and the investor reinvests the interest payments at the same rate as the overall return. Duration is the first derivative of the bond’s price with respect to the YTM, so it tells you how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest rates or “prevailing yields on similar bonds.” Portfolio managers use the YTM to measure their potential annualized returns and duration to manage interest-rate risk; they want the weighted-average duration of their entire bond portfolio to be in a certain range so that they’re not caught flat-footed if interest rates suddenly change. Q: Is a U.S. Treasury truly “risk-free?” If not, what are the risks, and how could you hedge against them? A: No. It’s free of default risk, but it still has interest-rate, currency, and inflation risk. For example, if overall interest rates increase, pushing up the yields on similar UST, the market value of any UST you own will decrease, and you will lose money if you sell them before maturity. If you convert from another currency into USD to buy these bonds, the FX rate could change and reduce the amount you earn back upon sale or maturity. And inflation risk means that if inflation runs above the YTM of the bond, you could also lose money in real terms, even if you receive all the interest payments and earn back the nominal amount you invested. Q: Recently, the Fed cut interest rates, but rates on 30-year mortgages increased. How is that possible? Shouldn’t they always follow the benchmark rate? A: The Fed only controls short-term interest rates – but mortgages are typically priced based on longer-term benchmarks, such as 10-year Treasuries. Even if short-term interest rates fall, long-term bond yields could rise if the market prices in higher political, economic, or inflation risk, which is likely what happened here. Also, mortgages have prepayment and credit default risk, so one of these may have increased despite the rate cut. Q: Compare and contrast gold and silver as assets. A: Both gold and silver are precious metals often used in the “defensive” part of portfolios. They both act as inflation hedges and provide downside protection in market crashes, making them particularly useful when interest rates are currently low but inflation expectations are rising. However, silver tends to be more volatile than gold and fluctuates more in different economics cycles, as it also has significant industrial uses, such as in EVs and smartphones. Most investors aim to maintain a specific gold/silver ratio over time. Q: Consider the USD/EUR exchange rate. Suppose that the ECB cuts interest rates at a faster rate than the Fed, the major EU member states report falling trade surpluses with the U.S., and European GDP growth comes in below expectations. Despite all this, the EUR *rises* against the USD. Why? A: Dozens of factors influence FX rates, but a currency tends to strengthen when yields on government bonds priced in that currency increase, when the country runs a trade surplus, and when economic growth exceeds expectations. So, in this scenario, we would expect the EUR to fall against the USD since it’s the opposite in each case. The answer probably lies in other factors not mentioned here: For example, maybe on-again-off-again/confusing tariffs or geopolitical uncertainty has reduced confidence in the USD, and investors have flocked to the EUR as a safe(r) haven. Many of these questions do not have “answers” – they’re designed to spur a discussion between you and the interviewer. You could say almost anything if you back it up with solid reasoning, so the goal is to assess how deep you can go based on your knowledge. Q: How will tariffs impact the global economy? A: We published a whole article about this one back in April, so you can start there. In short, tariffs are an additional corporate tax on foreign-sourced parts, supplies, and raw materials, so they tend to be inflationary if companies pass them on 1:1 to customers (which may or may not happen – it depends on their margins and competition). Theoretically, tariffs are supposed to encourage more domestic production, but the real-life results have been mixed. So, the best answer is that tariffs are “case by case,” and they’ll boost some sectors (e.g., domestic auto companies) while hurting others (luxury retailers, spirits companies, etc.). They turn the economy into more of a “government picks the winners and losers” game. Q: How will AI and automation affect the economy? A: AI and automation tools tend to reduce labor costs, but they increase demand for the required inputs, such as electricity and rare-earth/other metals. So, like tariffs, this one is case-by-case based on the labor costs in each industry, how much AI will shift those costs, and whether the industry is a “supplier” or “consumer.” For example, mining companies could benefit greatly because AI demand could boost prices for metals like aluminum, silicon, and copper (all used in chips), as it takes a long time for production to catch up. Many “white-collar” industries, such as law firms, Big 4 accounting firms, and banks, will likely see falling labor costs as teams can do more with less (so, they may be able to maintain or expand their margins even as they grow). On the other hand, sectors like nursing facilities may not be affected much because nurses are very difficult to “replace” or even “augment” with current AI tools. Q: The demographics in most developed countries are awful, as no one is having kids anymore. How will this affect GDP growth and asset prices? A: Falling populations due to low birth rates negatively impact GDP growth because it’s much harder to grow an economy when the population is falling (of course, improved automation could change this). Also, social welfare systems such as Social Security and Medicare in the U.S. become increasingly difficult to maintain since the burden falls disproportionately on younger workers. Higher taxes to fund these systems, plus benefit cuts to keep them solvent, both translate into reduced consumer spending, which puts more downward pressure on GDP. That said, asset prices will not necessarily fall because they depend on the money supply and fiscal and monetary factors as well. So, if the government runs huge deficits and prints money to fund these social welfare systems and prop up consumer spending, asset prices could keep inflating, even if the overall economy is poor. We’ve covered stock pitches extensively, including some of the differences in long-only roles. The short version is that you should prepare at least one “Long” pitch by following the guide, but it doesn’t have to be for a specific stock. If you’re interviewing for a role that’s more “big picture,” you could also pitch an ETF focused on a specific industry, geography, or company type. Rather than doing exhaustive research and creating a detailed model, focus on quick pitches that you can explain in 30 – 60 seconds. There’s a good “investor presentation” example for Tema Global Royalties ETF here. You could use this to extract and mention these points in your pitch: Finally, case studies outside of stock pitches are not that likely unless you complete a U.K.-style assessment center. If you do, expect some type of group exercise that involves portfolio construction or selecting Fund A vs. Fund B for your portfolio. This article turned out to be far longer than I expected because the breadth of topics in these interviews is so wide. Unfortunately, I don’t think there is a quick/straightforward preparation plan. You must read a lot about the economy, markets, trade, and geopolitics, and there is no real shortcut to understanding everything. If I had to suggest a specific plan, I’d recommend spending one day on each “preparable topic” above (fit/behavioral questions, portfolio/client management, accounting/valuation, equities, FICC, and your stock pitch). You should be able to do a decent job reviewing each one and outlining answers to common questions in this time frame. Don’t spend more than a day coming up with your stock pitch; maybe even limit it to a few hours to prevent an overly complex pitch. With everything in the other categories (“General Market Knowledge” and “Economics, Trade, and Geopolitics”), the only answer is to continuously read sources like the WSJ and FT. It may be boring, but winning the “Generalist Olympics” of asset management interviews is sort of like winning the real Olympics: A ton of repetition over long periods and more than a little luck.

What would you do to calm him down? A true asset management aficionado would say the benchmark went down by 40% and we performed top quartile amongst peers with lower volatility. I thought about adding something like that that, but 40% seemed extreme, even for a pessimist like me. Also, even though it’s true that AM returns are benchmarked against indices, I’m not sure an upset client really wants to hear that (I realize some articles and advice may suggest this).

Posted on 10/01/2025 10:14:25 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) are scrutinizing major corporations for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labor visa petitions after conducting mass layoffs of American employees. “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

H-1B Visa Holders are beneficial because they work for lower wages (bypassing the obnoxious and destructive minimum wage and union junk), thus reducing costs and lower prices, and benefitting the consumer. And when the consumer wins the economy wins and America wins. And the Left does not want America to win. 15 posted on 10/01/2025 10:29:20 AM PDT by Jim W N (MAGA by restoring the Gospel of the Grace of Christ (Jude 3) and our Free Constitutional Republic!)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

At home in time for the holidays. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft: Midnight just received a massive deep dive on its official channels. It's mostly an assemblage of information already out there, such as the new Demon Hunter Spec, the game's new zones, the transmog updates, and the upcoming Prey feature—which as a difficulty sicko with precious few mates that have raid-accessible schedules? I'm very excited about. One of the more interesting tidbits lies in its Campaign. While Midnight's first zone will be the Eversong Woods, Blizzard's shaking things up with the way the rest of the expansion's story will play out. Once you've tied things up near Silvermoon, you'll have your choice of Harandar, Zul'Aman, or—get this—a romp throughout older zones. Arator’s Journey will see you following Arator on his journey (no shockers there), visiting locations like Hope's Chapel, the Scarlet Monastery, and culminating at Blackrock Mountain. When you've completed both zone stories and this questline, you'll be funnelled to the Voidstorm to throw down with Xal'atath's forces directly. The rest of the deep dive's info has mostly been released by Blizzard on official channels before, but there are two notable exceptions. The first of which is the Arcantina, a cross-faction social hub that aims to be a place where players can chill out—and also pick up quests from seasonal NPCs. The second is that Player Housing, the long-awaited feature that Blizzard seems to basically be nailing thus far, will officially be releasing in early access on December 2—though you'll have to pre-purchase Midnight first. We also got to find out a little more about how players will be getting decor. The answer being, "through basically everything". Crafting, achievements, vendors, events, you name it. What's more, anything that's accolade-related—such as beating a raid—will be applied retroactively to your player's account. All in all, Midnight's shaping up to be real compelling. Transmog updates, base UI improvements, opt-in difficult world content where a bad guy can ambush you at any time, and the most important endgame of all: Making a cute little house to put all your trash in. Based on what I've seen of other games, WoW's housing features are going to be a phenomenal boon to the 20-year old MMO's community.

Title: First Brands’ Fall Renews Concerns Over Murky Trade Finance

(Bloomberg) -- When the auto-parts supplier First Brands Group filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, one name popped up in the documents again and again: Raistone. The little-known firm helps businesses secure short-term financing as they wait for customer payments to come through or seek to delay paying suppliers. On Tuesday, the New York-based company let go dozens of its workers as the deals it worked on for First Brands came under scrutiny. The collapse of First Brands is only the most recent instance of a firm like Raistone facilitating apparently low-risk transactions that have led to problems for companies and lenders in what is known as trade finance. Late last year, a Raistone competitor, Stenn Technologies, collapsed in dramatic fashion after promoting mundane corporate lending products that proved to be anything but. The biggest bust in the industry came in 2021, when Greensill Capital filed for insolvency after channeling bank deposits and insurance funds into short-term loans to risky companies, ultimately contributing to the forced sale of Credit Suisse Group AG. Raistone has a working familiarity with these past problems. It offered to take on stranded clients of Stenn, and the founder of Raistone, Dave Skirzenski, was one of the first employees at Greensill. He left that firm years before it collapsed, and there are no allegations of wrongdoing against either Raistone or First Brands. A few of Raistone’s workers previously held positions at Stenn, according to a review of their LinkedIn profiles. The links between these disconnected corporate crashes underscore the questions surrounding the tools and platforms that offer companies easy access to short-term corporate financing, often tied to some promised future revenue. While intermediaries like Raistone and Greensill aim to make these markets more efficient and available to a wider array of businesses, they can end up obscuring some of the risks for borrowers, lenders and even the platforms themselves. The innovation in trade finance is “supposed to be good, but oftentimes, those financial innovations are being taken advantage of and companies kind of hide information, take on more risk,” said Ben Lourie, a professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine’s business school. “Sometimes that risk explodes,” he added. Raistone and First Brands both declined to comment. Warning Signals Regulators and accounting experts have sounded alarms for years about the growth of off-balance sheet financing techniques that companies use to manage their short-term cash flow. Transactions between investment-grade companies and lenders carry low risk, but cracks can emerge for businesses on shakier financial footing. The funding for these deals has largely come from asset managers and insurance companies, rather than the banks that used to provide it, creating additional visibility problems for investors and regulators. In 2022, after the collapse of Greensill, US accounting rulemakers required companies to disclose the size and key terms of one kind of financing offered by Greensill called supply chain financing, which generally involves taking out short-term loans to pay suppliers. Even with the new rules, though, many of First Brands’ creditors felt they were left in the dark leading up to the bankruptcy. The court filings this week are providing many lenders with the first real glimpse at what went wrong with First Brands, which saw the value of its loans drop by more than half in a matter of weeks after concerns began to circulate about its off-balance sheet financing. The Michigan-based company, which owns car parts brands such as Carter fuel pumps and Trico wiper blades, was thought to have about $6 billion in debt. But when it filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night, there were over $10 billion in outstanding liabilities, and just $1 billion to $10 billion of assets. The company is owned by a businessman who kept a low profile, Patrick James, and it channeled much of its financing through a network of intermediaries owned by James. Short-Term Cash While there’s no indication of wrongdoing, a newly appointed board committee is now investigating the company’s use of roughly $2.3 billion of off-balance sheet financing, Chief Restructuring Officer Charles Moore said in a court filing. Some of the inventory backing these facilities “may have been commingled” with collateral securing a separate asset-backed loan facility. The declaration filed on Tuesday morning showed that $2.3 billion of First Brands’ liabilities were tied to a practice known as factoring that can turn expected future income, like outstanding receipts, into immediate cash — a sort of corporate payday loan. An industry group, the Secured Finance Network, reported this week that the total funds in use in factoring rose 13% between the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025. First Brands also owed another $800 million to creditors that offered supply-chain finance, the borrowing tool companies use to pay suppliers. Many of these arrangements ran through Raistone, which is listed as the point of contact for several of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, including the three largest, with combined claims of over half a billion dollars. While Raistone’s precise relationship to these creditors is not detailed in the documents, its website describes it as an administrator originating and placing such debt with its client investors. Unsecured Creditors Raistone was founded in 2017 by Skirzenski, who, in a 2020 interview, said that he imagined it as “the Amazon Web Services of trade finance,” standing in between the various players in the market. It advertises its services to companies that want to “get paid quickly without taking on debt,” and to investors looking to offer funding with a “short tenor,” “low default rates” and “no mark-to-market risk.” The company says it has offered nearly $15 billion in financing to date. While Raistone is typically only the intermediary in these transactions, it is also separately listed as one of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, for an “undetermined amount” tied to both factoring and supply-chain finance. Skirzenski would have been familiar with this mix of businesses at Greensill Capital, which he joined in 2013, according to his personal LinkedIn profile. After he left in 2017, Greensill grew into one of the hottest startups in the fintech industry, with a big investment from SoftBank Group Corp., ties to the highest ranks of the British government and a fleet of corporate jets. Greensill’s high profile founder, Lex Greensill, promoted the safe nature of his business lending against future cashflow, which appeared to be secured by the invoices themselves. However, it turned out that much of the money was lent against predicted future income, rather than actual invoices. This became a particular problem because Greensill’s business was largely concentrated on a handful of risky companies. Some of the same issues cropped up at Stenn, another UK trade finance fintech, though it also faced accusations of faked client lists and fraud. When Stenn went under last year, Raistone put up a website for “former Stenn clients left looking for an alternative” and promised interest rates as low as 6%. --With assistance from Lucca de Paoli.

Title: The Future of Financial Settlement Isn't Faster, It's Fundamentally Different

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The financial industry loves to talk about speed. Real-time payments. Instant settlement. Same-day ACH. But making a horse-drawn carriage go faster doesn't turn it into a car. The problem with traditional financial settlement is that it was built for a world that no longer exists. Traditional financial infrastructure is a patchwork of batch processing systems, correspondent banking relationships and siloed databases that were state-of-the-art when telex machines roamed the earth. Even today's "real-time" payment rails are largely smoke and mirrors. They’re just faster messages layered on top of the same 1970’s architecture. They still require reconciliation, suffer from counterparty risk and depend on business hours in specific time zones. This is a design problem. Consider what actually happens when a fintech promises "instant" international transfers. Behind the scenes, they're pre-funding accounts, managing float across multiple jurisdictions and hoping their reconciliation catches any discrepancies before month-end. The customer sees speed, but the company shoulders massive operational complexity and working capital requirements. Settlement friction negatively impacts every business that moves money. An e-commerce platform waiting T+2 for card settlements ties up working capital that could fund inventory. A logistics company managing international suppliers juggles dozens of banking relationships just to pay invoices. Even sophisticated enterprises with treasury management systems spend millions annually on the plumbing that moves value between entities. This isn't sustainable in a world where digital commerce happens 24/7, supply chains span continents and customers expect Amazon-like efficiency from every interaction. Why do we have same-day delivery on a weekend for packages but not financial transfers? Public blockchain infrastructure offers something that is worlds apart from traditional financial infrastructure: a shared, programmable settlement layer that operates continuously, transparently and without intermediaries. Value can move incredibly fast through a global economy built on blockchain rails. When BlackRock tokenized its BUIDL money market fund, it showed a recognition that 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement and programmable compliance create genuine operational advantages. When companies issue tokenized shares, they create a more efficient, transparent and accessible capital market infrastructure. These new financial primitives create entirely new markets. Let’s be clear that it’s not just financial services that are being revamped through better payment rails. The real unlock provided by smart contracts is that they can automate complex multi-party workflows that today require armies of back-office staff. A manufacturer can pay suppliers automatically when IoT sensors confirm delivery and quality checks. Real estate transactions can settle atomically, with payment, title transfer and regulatory filings happening simultaneously. Insurance claims can trigger instant payouts when parametric conditions are met. The point, again, is that blockchain doesn't just digitize traditional finance or provide increased speed. Different rails mean entirely new business models are possible. Every major bank is already tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Circle moves billions in USDC daily. PayPal's stablecoin runs on public blockchains. Why are any enterprises still debating whether this is "real?" They're missing the plot. While traditional companies optimize their SWIFT messages and patch their core banking systems, an entire parallel financial system has emerged. The gig economy worker in Manila doesn't know or care that her USDC payment bypassed the correspondent banking network; she cares about whether the money arrived instantly, so that she can use it immediately to pay rent, buy groceries or send some home to her family, all without fees eating away at her paycheck. The thing about infrastructure revolutions is that they don't announce themselves. In five years, "we still use ACH" will be the new "we still host our own servers in-house." It’s technically possible, unnecessarily expensive, and a clear signal you've fallen behind. The payment rails upgrade has happened. It just hasn't been evenly distributed yet.

As a reminder, the High Score scoring format is as follows: Points: 1 point Rebounds: 1 point Assists: 2 points Blocks: 3 points Steals: 3 points And here's how the starting lineup breaks down: Guard Guard Frontcourt Frontcourt Frontcourt FLEX/UTIL There are also four bench spots. 101 on the format In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Join a league now With High Score's streamlined and positionless format, there are just two guard spots, three frontcourt spots and a single flex/utility spot. There's no need to worry about filling every position (PG, SG, SF, PF or C) like traditional fantasy basketball formats. This gives you way more freedom to build your lineup your way — whether you want to stack up on guards, bulk up on versatile forwards or mix and match based on your favorite draft strategy. Or, better yet … Drafting players with both guard and frontcourt eligibility is a savvy move in High Score. With only 30 of these versatile options available within the top 150, you get the freedom to easily adjust your lineup when injuries or rest days pop up. Here's the list of players with dual eligibility whom I’d target: Scottie Barnes Jaylen Brown Amen Thompson Desmond Bane Josh Hart Dyson Daniels Paul George Cam Thomas Brandon Ingram Bennedict Mathurin Devin Vassell Shaedon Sharpe Norman Powell Andrew Wiggins Bradley Beal Christian Braun Ayo Dosunmu Nickeil Alexander-Walker Bilal Coulibaly Jaylen Wells Quentin Grimes Kyshawn George Prioritize these players on draft day for an additional edge in High Score. Let's start with one of the biggest changes you need to know: Guards are more valuable than ever. The scoring updates in High Score are a massive boost for playmakers and perimeter defenders. Assists are now worth a full 2 points each, a big jump from the previous 1.5, and turnovers no longer deduct points. This is a game-changer. This scoring tweak turns high-assist guards into prized fantasy assets. Trae Young and Cade Cunningham — two high-assist, high-turnover guards — are even better in High Score. But it doesn't stop there. Steals are worth a hefty 3 points, and guards tend to rack up steals at a higher rate than most frontcourt players. So, a guard who drops between 6-10 assists, plus a steal and no turnovers to worry about, is already giving you a huge point boost before you even count their points and rebounds. This doesn't mean you should ignore big men entirely. In fact, it makes certain types of frontcourt players even more valuable. Guys who are the hub of their offense, like Paolo Banchero, Domantas Sabonis or Alperen Şengün, also get a bump in High Score. Your draft plan should prioritize these assist-heavy players, whether they bring the ball up the court or facilitate from the high post. In other formats, a player who misses a game or two can be a weekly disaster. That fear leads to players with injury risk, like Joel Embiid, sliding down draft boards. In High Score, that risk practically vanishes. Since you only need one great game from a starter each week, "load management" and minor absences become far less concerning. Think about Embiid. He averages over 50 fantasy points per game when he plays, but his availability concerns often push him beyond the fifth round in traditional drafts. In High Score, he’s a first-round talent, no question. All you need is one of his signature dominant performances per week to get elite production from that roster spot. He can play once, drop a 50-burger and you're set for the week. This mindset applies throughout the draft. Look for players who have week-winning potential. Jalen Green is a perfect mid-round example. He's known for being inconsistent, but he’s also capable of erupting for a massive scoring night at any moment. In other formats, his duds would frustrate you. Here, you only care about the peak. One 40-point game is all it takes to make him a valuable asset. Your goal is to build a roster full of players who can go off, not just show up. These are reliable, night-in and night-out contributors who grab rebounds and block a couple of shots. In many fantasy formats, they provide a stable floor. In High Score, the Rudy Gobert types aren't as valuable. The scoring system devalues one of their primary contributions: Rebounds are now worth just 1 point compared to 1.2 previously. While Gobert might have a spike game with 20+ rebounds or four blocks, the overall offensive game for traditional frontcourt players is limited. You generally know what you're getting — a low-end double-double. That predictable production just doesn't move the needle in a format where you're chasing explosive point totals. Focus on bigs who are more involved in the offense or who contribute across multiple categories, not just the traditional big-man stats. Let someone else in your league draft these "safe" centers. High Score features smaller rosters (10 players in total, including four bench spots), which might seem restrictive, but it actually gives you incredible freedom in the later rounds of your draft. You don't need to waste those final picks on safe, low-upside players just to fill out your roster. Instead, it’s time to go big-game hunting. Use your late-round picks to swing for the fences. Target volatile players who have the potential for spike performances. Rookies with a clear path to scoring, like Wizards rookie Tre Johnson, are my ideal targets. He might be inconsistent early on, but his role is expected to grow and he has the talent to deliver a 30-point game out of nowhere. The beauty of this strategy lies in its low-risk nature. If your lottery ticket doesn't pan out, the short bench makes it an easy decision to drop him for a hot player on the waiver wire. You're not tied to your late-round picks. Take a chance on a player who could have a few huge weeks. Those are the swings that can separate you from the rest of the league. While chasing points and assists is crucial, don't forget about the defensive side of the ball. Steals and blocks — affectionately known as "stocks" in fantasy basketball — are both worth 3 points apiece. These stats can be random, but they add up quickly and can be the difference in a close matchup. Prioritizing players who contribute on both ends of the floor is a savvy move. Guards who are elite defenders, like Derrick White, are incredibly valuable. He can fill up the stat sheet with points and assists while also adding a couple of steals and a block, providing a well-rounded and high-scoring fantasy line. In the frontcourt, look for versatile defenders who can do a bit of everything. Players like the Thompson twins (Amen and Ausar) are great examples. They have the athleticism to block shots and the quick hands to rack up steals, giving you multiple avenues to score fantasy points. If you miss out on some of the top-tier offensive stars, pivoting to elite defensive players is a fantastic way to build a competitive and balanced roster, should you miss out on some of the high-volume scorers.

Title: Contrarians Only: A “Flash” Sale On Our Top AI Dividend

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. We contrarians live for the “one-off” shots at extra income (or gains!) our favorite AI dividend plays throw our way. One of these “special situations” just landed in our lap: A shot at buying a megatrend-powered 7.6% dividend that’s rarely cheap. And we’re picking it up for a song. It’s a long-time holding of our Contrarian Income Report advisory, and it’s sitting right in the tracks of the surging AI buildout. In fact, it may be the last “cheap” AI play on the board! This one’s dropped from trading for more than its portfolio is worth to a lot less. As you can see, this fund dropped from trading 6% above its net asset value (NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio) to 7.1% below, as of this writing. It’s a huge drop, and it stands out because, as you can see above, this fund, the 7.6%-yielding Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), is rarely cheap for long. UTF’s latest tour in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio started in November 2020, and this reliable utility fund has been humming away since, handing us a 7.8% yield on our original buy, plus a monthly payout that’s rolled in like clockwork. That’s exactly what we bought it to do. And it’s handed us a 41% total return in that time, too. And now we have a shot at buying it cheaper than we did five years ago! Let me put all of this in dollars and cents for you. In the past year, UTF’s average premium has been 1.8%. If the discount reverts to that level, price upside of around 10% is on the table here. And that’s before we factor in the growth of its portfolio. Let’s talk about that now. We bought UTF in late 2020 because its utility-stock holdings—including big players like NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (CO)—are essentially “bond proxies.” When rates fall, as they did then, utilities rise. Nowadays, we have a similar setup. As we discussed in last week’s article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI’s limitless power demand. Let’s take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That’s just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF’s total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% “discount gap.” This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It’s all about investor sentiment. And we’re happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF’s management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a “transferable rights offering” on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the “record date”—September 22—you get one “right” to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here’s how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock’s average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund’s average price is below 90% of its NAV—again, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio—the price will be set at 90% of NAV. That “floor” helps limit the offer’s downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you’ll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don’t pick up. If you don’t want to get in on the action here, that’s fine—you can sell your rights—hence the “transferable” in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S’s website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let’s look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS’s discount deepened on the offer’s announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF’s AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management’s ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they’ll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar—and ride its closing “discount gap” higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

As we discussed in last week’s article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI’s limitless power demand. Let’s take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That’s just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF’s total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% “discount gap.” This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It’s all about investor sentiment. And we’re happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF’s management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a “transferable rights offering” on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the “record date”—September 22—you get one “right” to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here’s how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock’s average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund’s average price is below 90% of its NAV—again, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio—the price will be set at 90% of NAV. That “floor” helps limit the offer’s downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you’ll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don’t pick up. If you don’t want to get in on the action here, that’s fine—you can sell your rights—hence the “transferable” in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S’s website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let’s look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS’s discount deepened on the offer’s announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF’s AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management’s ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they’ll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar—and ride its closing “discount gap” higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: CoreWeave Stock To $250?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/01/coreweave-stock-to-250/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T13:22:50Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CoreWeave stock (NASDAQ:CRWV) exhibited an impressive performance increase of 12% on September 30, 2025, following the announcement of a groundbreaking $14.2 billion partnership with Meta Platforms, affirming the organization’s position as a leading AI infrastructure provider. The seven-year agreement with Meta, which extends through December 2031 with the potential for expansion into 2032, signifies a strategic diversification success for CoreWeave. Having been reliant on Microsoft for roughly 70% of its revenue, this partnership fundamentally alters CoreWeave’s risk related to client concentration while illustrating the scalability of its specialized GPU infrastructure model. The partnership guarantees Meta access to CoreWeave’s Nvidia GB300 server racks, each outfitted with 72 of Nvidia’s advanced Blackwell AI GPUs, establishing CoreWeave as Meta’s infrastructure partner for forthcoming AI workloads. This agreement comes on the heels of CoreWeave’s recent $6.5 billion expansion with OpenAI, raising the total contracted revenue with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and creating a varied blue-chip client portfolio. We elaborate further on this development and CoreWeave’s valuation in the sections below. That being said, if you’re looking for a less volatile investment than holding a single stock like CRWV, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has realized returns surpassing 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; avoiding a tumultuous experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In addition, refer to – Wait For A Dip To Buy Hims & Hers Health Stock Meta’s dedication grants CoreWeave unparalleled revenue visibility and confirms the company’s specialized “AI Hyperscaler” strategy. As Meta actively enhances its investments in AI infrastructure—with capital expenditures anticipated between $66-72 billion for 2025—CoreWeave becomes an essential infrastructure provider for one of the largest AI spenders in the tech industry. The agreement bolsters CoreWeave’s competitive advantage against hyperscale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud by showcasing that specialized AI infrastructure can command premium pricing and foster client loyalty. CoreWeave’s current market capitalization of approximately $70 billion and its current revenue base of $3.5 billion indicate that the company trades at roughly 19 times trailing revenue—a compelling multiple considering its rapid growth trajectory. For context, CoreWeave's revenue is projected to increase over 3.5 times, nearing approximately $18 billion by 2027. Does this imply the company’s valuation will decrease to under 4 times sales, assuming the stock price stays stable? We do not think so. Even at a more conservative 8 times revenues, the company’s valuation would likely surpass $145 billion, representing more than a doubling from current levels in the next three years. Indeed, this valuation seems conservative when compared to other high-growth technology stocks that trade at considerably higher revenue multiples. For instance, among AI and Data Infrastructure Leaders, Snowflake trades at around 18x revenue despite slower 28% growth rates, while Palantir commands a 124x revenue multiple with a 39% growth rate. In the realm of High-Growth SaaS Companies, Palo Alto Networks trades at a 15x revenue multiple, and HubSpot at a 10x multiple. There are numerous other comparable examples. CoreWeave’s recent achievements authenticate our previous forecasts of substantial upside potential, with the stock rising 47% over the last month and more than tripling since its IPO in March 2025 at $40 per share. The company’s revenue growth of 206% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching $1.213 billion with 62% adjusted EBITDA margins, showcases significant operational leverage at scale. With a contracted backlog of $30.1 billion offering multi-year revenue predictability and nearly 50% anticipated to be realized within 24 months, CoreWeave presents investors with both growth and certainty—an unusual pairing in high-growth technology stocks. The partnership with Meta reinforces CoreWeave’s thesis as the specialized infrastructure layer driving the AI revolution, positioning the company for sustained growth as enterprise AI adoption accelerates across various verticals. Naturally, we could be incorrect in our evaluations, and investors should carefully consider the risks prior to investing in CRWV stock. The primary risks associated with CoreWeave revolve around its financial stability and market standing. Specifically, the company confronts substantial challenges stemming from fierce competition with major cloud providers and the possibility of market cyclicality in AI spending. From an operational perspective, CoreWeave has a -29% net margin and a $15 billion debt burden necessary for significant infrastructure investments, compounded by a critical customer concentration risk with major clients such as OpenAI. It’s important to recognize that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What accounts for this success? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a dynamic means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when the markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Pseudonymous X user Buzzlamic Jihad, who is called Buzz by his friends and family, told Decrypt that he hopes to address Aptos’ image problem and position it as a premium stablecoin network—harking back to the original Libra vision from Facebook in which Aptos was founded. He said that one way he aims to do this is by leveraging his personal connections with the co-founders of the President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, two of whom were mentors to the shitposter. "Buzz is an inventor and true Aptos missionary through and through,” Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at Aptos, told Decrypt. “I'm excited for him to come on board as an advisor to expand everyone's imagination of what is truly possible only on Aptos.” Aptos looking good here https://t.co/eTQrNlu1ga — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) September 14, 2025 Back in February, Buzz was partly responsible for a 17% pump for Aptos' APT token as the crypto community started to notice the memes he had been posting for months. The then-little-known social media user had been spamming “Aptos lookin’ good here,” “sidelined?” and “motion not priced in yet” in unwavering support for the layer-1 blockchain. These phrases have since become canonical crypto memes, with major crypto figures and companies embracing them. The buzz, pardon the pun, was so effective that Pampati told Decrypt in May it helped to revive developer interest in the network, in an unexpected display of the power of memes. Aptos looking good here This is just the last 24h pic.twitter.com/pagwYwZ1nD — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) February 16, 2025 At the time, people wondered how a seemingly random X user could have such a large impact. It turns out Buzz has a history in growth marketing, specializing in Facebook advertising, and claims to have generated millions with this venture. During that period, Buzz told Decrypt, he was mentored by Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, successful Facebook marketers who went on to co-found World Liberty Financial. At one point, Buzz said he lived with the pair in Puerto Rico and was briefly their business partner. Given his history with Facebook, now Meta, Buzz explained that he was immediately attracted to Aptos as it was formed by developers from Libra—a now-defunct stablecoin project led by Facebook. The deeper he dug, the more he liked about Aptos, and he started posting about it under the pseudonym Buzzlamic Jihad. After the February pump, Buzz claims he was offered a role in marketing at Aptos but turned it down. Over the coming months, he continued conversations with the Aptos team and has now signed a deal to become an advisor. In many ways, Buzz joining Aptos as an advisor is comparable to if meme stock influencer Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill joined GameStop—a rumor that once circulated on the internet. As the possibility of joining Aptos emerged, Buzz reached out to Folkman after years of not being in contact and told him, “Let’s run it back.” He helped connect Folkman with Aptos CEO Avery Ching, with the pair meeting at the White House crypto summit in March. Following this interaction, and without further help from Buzz, World Liberty Financial agreed to list its USD1 stablecoin on Aptos—which was announced in October at Token2049 in Singapore. BREAKING: @DonaldJTrumpJr & @ZachWitkoff just announced that @worldlibertyfi's USD1 is coming to @Aptos as the first Move based deployment. Our teams share a united mission of building the best financial infrastructure for 🇺🇸 and the world. Much more to come… 🦅🌐 https://t.co/DjxBvviJts pic.twitter.com/0P3YfSaY63 — avery.apt 🇺🇸 (@AveryChing) October 1, 2025 But this is just the beginning, Buzz told Decrypt. He intends to continue to leverage his relationship with the World Liberty Financial team to attract “net new buyers” to Aptos, fix its image, and position it as a premium stablecoin network. He went on to hint at bigger potential collaborations to come, although nothing is set in stone. “I think it's very relevant right now because you see chains like Plasma, they’re doing very well. Everyone was talking about them. Now you even have Circle, they’re launching the Tempo blockchain,” Buzz said, referencing the Plasma stablecoin network. “They’re basically doing Libra 2.0 … so the idea is validated. Aptos has the technology, it’s just frustrating that they don’t have the right messaging.” Now officially working for Aptos, Buzz hopes to have a direct hand in fixing this messaging. He also told Decrypt that he has some “bigger goals” which, if he achieves, he will be paid more for. That’s not to mention that he’s requested that he be paid entirely in APT tokens, as a sign of his belief in the network. After making his name by asking people if they’re sidelined, Buzz is finally no longer sidelined himself. “I am trying to community takeover,” Buzz told Decrypt. “That started as a meme, but as it progressed, I’m like, ‘Maybe it's actually possible. Could I actually do this?’,” he said, adding, “This isn’t a joke anymore. I’m actually working on it.” “It’s lookin' good here,” he finished.

Title: Let’s talk about ARR

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. It’s likely safe to say—creative accounting’s been around for as long as accounting itself. In 1494, for example, mathematician and ‘father of modern accounting’ Luca Pacioli wrote of Venetian merchants willfully rendering their ledgers illegible. In the Gilded Age, inflating assets and understating liabilities was standard practice across a booming system. And who can forget the “channel stuffing” of the 2000s? And, because some things are eternal, this era naturally has its own creative accounting practices, which I published a feature on this past weekend. Right now, some of the most clear shenanigans are going on around ARR, or “annual recurring revenue.” “The problem is that so much of this is essentially vibe revenue,” one VC told me. “It’s not Google signing a data center contract. That’s real shit. Some startup that’s using your product temporarily? That’s really not revenue.” ARR was a favorite metric of VCs throughout the software-as-a-service (SaaS) era, widely accepted as a trusted proxy for a stable and growing startup. Now, founders are trying to apply ARR to the AI boom—and it doesn’t fit. These days, founders are counting pilots, one-time deals, or unactivated contracts as recurring revenue, six VCs told Fortune. The push comes from somewhere very human, from a desire to keep up with the competition. “There is all this pressure from companies like Decagon, Cursor, and Cognition that are just crushing it,” said another VC. “There’s so much pressure to be the company that went from zero to $100 million in X days.” At the center of all this is an essential truth: That we’re going to need to evolve metrics with AI, and how AI companies actually work. And in the meantime, it’s worth saying: Creative accounting has been around as long as businesses were counting, but that doesn’t mean it’s good practice. That doesn’t mean it’s safe or healthy for the system. And it doesn’t mean there won’t be consequences for some down the line. Read the whole story here.

More Info Global investment firm KKR has acquired a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets LLC, the gas pipeline network of Abu Dhabi’s national oil company, in a move signaling growing investor confidence in infrastructure opportunities in the oil and gas-rich Middle East. The new investment, the value of which was not disclosed, strengthens KKR’s long-term strategic partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and reflects the firm’s confidence in Abu Dhabi’s competitiveness as a premier global investment destination, the private equity giant said on Wednesday. The gas pipeline network connects ADNOC’s upstream assets to local off-takers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pipeline ownership and operational management remain with ADNOC. The deal for a minority stake in ADNOC’s gas pipelines assets follows the first such transaction in the Middle East, when KKR bought in 2019 a minority stake in ADNOC’s oil pipelines business. The 2019 acquisition of 40% in ADNOC Oil Pipelines by KKR and BlackRock was the first-ever investment of foreign asset managers in infrastructure of a state-owned energy firm in the Gulf. Last year, KKR and BlackRock sold the 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines LLC to Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment manager Lunate. Commenting on the deal for ADNOC’s gas pipeline infrastructure, General David Petraeus, chairman of KKR Middle East, said today that “This investment reflects KKR’s commitment to expand partnerships and investment across the Middle East. The region’s strong fundamentals, bold vision, and focused leadership offer increasingly attractive opportunities for global investors.” Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is a key part of Aramco’s plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand.

Title: These are UBS's 10 highest-conviction stock picks in the hottest corner of the market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been another big year for tech in 2025. The broader tech, media, and telecommunications sector is one of the hottest corners of the market, and UBS shared its top picks this week. Within the S&P 500, tech stocks are up 20% year-to-date, while communications services stocks are up 22%. That handily outpaces the broader index, which is up just 13% from levels at the start of the year. In a note to clients, analysts at UBS highlighted 10 buy-rated stocks within the two sectors, which represented the bank's "highest-conviction calls" in that segment of the market. The calls also reflected companies where UBS had a "differentiated view" or proprietary data that supported its bullish call, analysts said. Here are the top stocks on the bank's radar: Ticker: NIQ Year-to-date performance: -16% Predicted upside: +56% Analyst reasoning: "Following its 2021 transformation, including ~$920m in investments ($400m in technology, $520m across deals, and Fetch), NIQ is positioned for ~5% organic CC revenue growth (2024-27E). We model adjusted EBITDA margin improving +550bps to 24.1% by 2027E, driven by cost efficiencies and equity quality enhancements." Ticker: DIS Year-to-date performance: +2% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "We remain bullish on Disney shares and continue to view parks as a value driver (which should improve as new attractions/cruise capacity comes online)," analysts wrote. "This supports our view that Disney can grow EPS at a ~17% CAGR through F27 vs. the Street's ~13%." Ticker: AMT Year-to-date performance: +6% Predicted upside: +35% Analyst reasoning: "AMT is poised to benefit from increased U.S. carrier activity (AT&T amendments post-Echostar spectrum acquisition; VZ/TMUS densification) and accelerated international growth, driving 6-8% annual AFFO/sh growth from '25-'27E, up from ~1% recently." Ticker: AMZN Year-to-date performance: -0.4% Predicted upside: +23% Analyst reasoning: "Amazon appears most poised for growth due to investments in e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and satellites. As revenue scales, upward revisions to operating profit and FCF could outpace peers. We project operating margins of 11.3% in 2025E, 12.9% in 2026E, and 15.7% in 2027E, with potential upside if incremental revenue generation exceeds current forecasts." Ticker: APP Year-to-date performance: +108% Predicted upside: +13% Analyst reasoning: "Over the next 12-months, we expect APP to execute on a combination of demand and supply expansion initiatives that could improve the efficacy of Axon 2.0 and in-turn deliver estimate and multiple upsides." Ticker: MA Year-to-date performance: +8% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "Within the Payments, Processors, & FinTech sector, Mastercard provides diversified exposure across spend categories and benefits from robust growth in value-added services (~40% of business, high-teens growth). Key strengths include strong profitability (~55-70% EBIT margins, high FCF conversion), competitive moats, scalability, EPS resilience, GAAP-like EPS quality, and expansion into new flows (e.g., Mastercard Move)." Ticker: MRVL Year-to-date performance: -26% Predicted upside: +14% Analyst reasoning: "Marvell is well positioned to grow its Amazon custom ASIC revenue in '26, driven by Tranium2+ exceeding 1MM units next year." Ticker: SNOW Year-to-date performance: +42% Predicted upside: 27% Analyst reasoning: "We're Buy-rated on Snowflake shares, supported by tailwinds such as 1) rising customer focus on data migration and modernization driven by GenAI, 2) resilient AI and data spending amid macro uncertainty, and 3) growth from new products alongside stable core consumption, enabling high-20%/30% growth in FY26/CY25E (vs consensus at 27%)." Ticker: VRNS Year-to-date performance: +28% Predicted upside: +22% Analyst reasoning: "We rate Varonis shares as Buy, driven by 1) rising enterprise focus on data security, supported by AI adoption and dedicated budgets, 2) expected growth beyond conversions post-CY25 via expanded platform features and data store coverage (CY26 revs growth modeled at 21% vs Cons. 18%), and 3) increasing AI deployments enhancing demand for M365 Copilot security through its Microsoft partnership and other AI-driven SKUs." Ticker: BRZE Year-to-date performance: -31% Predicted upside: +43% Analyst reasoning: "We believe BRZE's shares are attractive at 4x CY26 revenue, trading at a discount to SMID apps peers at 11x despite superior growth prospects (20%+ vs. peers in high-teens). Sustained 20%+ revenue growth is supported by customer and partner field checks showing teens-plus spend growth." Jump to

Title: A Northwestern grad shares how she landed job interviews at Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and a tech role at Salesforce

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Karishma Mandal wanted to be at the center of the tech world — working in AI at a big-name company in San Francisco. So she moved across the country — and tapped every job search strategy in her toolbox, hoping to land an offer. Mandal's career journey — which would include interviews at Uber, Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce — began when she moved to the US from India in 2021 to pursue a master's in engineering management at Northwestern University. After graduating in January 2023, she began working full-time in March of that year as a product manager at a consulting firm in Chicago — before leaving for a senior product manager role at a healthcare company that November. The position was remote, with team members spread across the country. In her first few months on the job, Mandal said she missed working with people in person — and the time zone differences made it even harder to connect with colleagues. At the same time, she kept hearing about tech meetups and professional events happening regularly in San Francisco — opportunities she said were harder to find in Chicago. There was also the unavoidable buzz around generative AI, the future of which seemed increasingly centered in the Bay Area. San Francisco, she realized, was where she needed to be. So she started planning a move, with the goal of eventually landing an AI-focused role at a large tech company. "I felt like, as a tech person, I had to be in San Francisco," said the 29-year-old. But one big hurdle stood in the way of her plan: the tough tech job market. Mandal is among the many tech professionals who've struggled to find work or to change jobs in recent years. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the start of 2025, global tech companies — including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon — have collectively laid off more than 80,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have coincided with a broader slowdown in white-collar hiring. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are now hiring at nearly the slowest pace since 2014. Still, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Mandal shared how she landed interviews at several tech giants — and ultimately secured a role at Salesforce. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above. You can also find more of our job market coverage below: In May 2024, Mandal moved to San Francisco while continuing to work remotely for the healthcare company. She said she didn't start job hunting right away, in part because the move was overwhelming. There were boxes to unpack, and she didn't have any friends or family in the area. Instead, she focused on settling in and building her social and professional network from scratch. "When I came to San Francisco, I really had no one," she said. When Mandal began her job search in September 2024, she sensed the tech hiring landscape wasn't in her favor. To gain traction, she believed she needed to connect directly with hiring managers and recruiters. Rather than simply applying to job listings, she looked for people who were actively posting about open product manager roles on LinkedIn. One trick she used was searching "product manager + hiring" — a combination that filtered for posts containing both terms. Then she'd apply LinkedIn's "past 24 hours" filter to surface the newest listings. To take things a step further, she'd tweak the URL manually — changing the number of seconds from 86,400 (24 hours) to 3,600 (1 hour) — to see posts from the past hour. Once she found a post of interest, Mandal said she'd message the recruiter or hiring manager — explaining why she was interested in the role and why she thought she'd be a good fit. In addition to filtering LinkedIn posts, Mandal applied the same logic to the platform's job listings tab — using filters to uncover the newest openings. Based on conversations with recruiters and her network, she said she thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role. Many recruiters, she said, are far more likely to closely review the 20th application than the 200th or the 2,000th. Career experts previously told Business Insider that being among the first applicants could give candidates an edge. Mandal was also strategic about how she submitted applications. She said an HR professional at one company told her they prioritized applications submitted directly through their website over those sourced via LinkedIn — even if the candidate was redirected there from a LinkedIn post. Mandal figured following that advice couldn't hurt her chances. To get an extra edge, Mandal said she used the referral platform Refer.me to secure referrals for roles at McKinsey and Best Buy. A free account allows users to send one referral request a week to employees at a wide range of companies. "You have to be early, you have to be through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," Mandal said of her job search strategies. Over time, Mandal's job search strategies began to pay off. She said reaching out to an Amazon recruiter and an Uber hiring manager on LinkedIn — after seeing their posts about open roles — helped her secure interviews at both companies. A separate referral from a Meta employee — sourced outside Refer.me — led to another interview. Business Insider has verified her interview offers by reviewing emails she received from the respective companies. Mandal said her Uber interview included a case study involving AI tools built around user communication data, while Meta's featured questions about measuring the performance of AI features on Instagram. The Amazon interview, she said, focused more on the company's leadership principles. These interviews didn't ultimately lead to offers. But in late 2024, Mandal messaged a Salesforce recruiter on LinkedIn who had posted about an AI-related product manager role — and eventually heard back to schedule an interview. Over the next several weeks, Mandal said she went through a seven-round interview process that included a design exercise where she was asked to create an AI-powered lawn mower; conversations with the engineering, product, and AI teams; and a final interview with a senior leader. "They're not limited to behavioral questions," she said of Salesforce interviews. "Most hiring managers want to see real expertise." Mandal said she received an offer from Salesforce around the end of the year, which included a six-figure salary about 40% higher than what she earned in her previous role. She started full-time in January. While San Francisco's high cost of living has been frustrating at times, she said the career benefits have made relocating from Chicago worthwhile. "If you are trying to make a big career move in tech, I'd recommend living in San Francisco and seeing how you can leverage your network," she said. Jump to

Title: Top 2025 Synthetic Dollar Protocols to Earn High Yield in Crypto (Naina Rajgopalan)

Synthetic dollars have become a practical bridge between “stablecoin-like” price stability and market-rate yields, packaging professional hedging and cash-equivalent income into assets that behave like dollars onchain. This article explains the core concepts and profiles three leading projects: Falcon Finance (USDf), Ethena (USDe), and Elixir (deUSD), with a special focus on how they balance stability, yield, collateral breadth, and operational risk to deliver competitive APY. Before moving to the overview of synthetic dollar projects, it is worth to unpack some concepts, core to understanding how these protocols work. First, what is a synthetic dollar? It is a crypto-native asset engineered to hold a $1 value, typically via overcollateralization and delta-neutral hedging of crypto collateral (or other instruments), and generate yield (the net return paid to all synthetic dollar holders), although yield is not universal or guaranteed. Synthetic dollar protocols are applications that allow to mint, stake and perform other operations with synthetic dollars, usually in an automatic manner. Most 2025 synthetic dollar designs achieve a stable yield stream by adopting certain yield-generation strategies, in particular pairing spot collateral with delta-neutral hedges, e.g., short perpetual futures, so the portfolio’s net exposure to the underlying assets is close to zero. There can be additional strategies, such as staking, cross-exchange arbitrage and DeFi liquidity provisioning. Furthermore, every synthetic dollar protocol employs a certain mechanism of collateralization and acceptance. Some protocols accept a narrow set of blue-chip cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), while others aim to accept many crypto assets and even real-world assets (RWAs). In 2025, synthetic dollar protocols also incorporate RWA rails in different forms, such as tokenized money-market funds or U.S. treasuries (T-bills), e.g., BlackRock BUIDL and Superstate USTB. Tokenized assets are used either as direct backing (treasury-backed stables) or as yield components alongside delta-neutral positions. Synthetic dollars have gained increasing popularity in 2025. According to Coingecko, the sector’s market cap more than doubled throughout the year, growing from about $6 billion to more than $16 billion by early September 2025. In one of the articles, Financial Times noted how yields compressed from the early burst of over 60% annualized to low single digits as competition crowded the basis trades, making synthetic dollar protocols a broad marketplace. At the same time, protocol design diversified: ● Some protocols added treasury-backed lines (e.g., Falcon Finance’s USTB or Ethena’s USDtb) for traditional cash management, while keeping synthetic dollars themselves (USDf, USDe, deUSD) for crypto-native yield. ● Projects like Falcon Finance offered a multi-strategy, collateral-agnostic approach aiming for steadier yields through different market regimes and a pathway to a broader collateral base (including RWAs). ● At the same time, Elixir positioned its deUSD token as “order-book infrastructure” and RWA rails, combining stETH-based hedges with sUSDS-linked treasury yields. Design and goal. The second most capitalized synthetic dollar protocol (per Coingecko), Falcon Finance manages USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic dollar, and sUSDf as the yield-bearing token. While the project offers one of the highest yield rates, its main goal is to become a universal collateralization layer: many crypto assets, along with RWA, qualify today, and more RWAs (stocks, real estate and more) are about to be added in the future. Collateral. Assets accepted by Falcon Finance as collateral for minting USDf range from major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI, USDS) to blue-chips and altcoins (BTC/WBTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, TRX, TON, AVAX, SEI, etc.), plus RWA: Superstate USTB (tokenized short-duration U.S. government securities). Yield-generation engine. Falcon distributes yield from multiple sources rather than relying only on positive funding: ● Positive and negative funding arbitrage (long spot/short perp or the converse). ● Cross-exchange price arbitrage. ● Native staking on supported non-stablecoin assets. ● Select liquidity pool deployments. Rates and traction. Emerging in early 2025, Falcon Finance has quickly risen to the top of the synthetic dollar sector: USDf total supply grew from $100 million in the end of March 2025 to over $1.6 billion in early September 2025. The main reason for popularity is one of the best APY rates, which fluctuate between 8% and 15%, but is usually above 10%. Risk management. Falcon’s risk controls combine a live Transparency page that breaks down reserves across custodians, CEX, and on-chain positions with weekly independent attestations, published for ongoing verification. Its smart contracts have been audited by Zellic and Pashov with no critical or high-severity issues identified. Operational measures include off-exchange settlement: assets are held with MPC custodians (e.g., Fireblocks and Ceffu, and trading is mirrored to top crypto exchanges to reduce counterparty exposure. Additional safeguards include an onchain insurance fund launched in August 2025 with an initial $10 million contribution, and the acceptance of Superstate’s USTB in the collateral set, introducing tokenized T-bill exposure through a regulated RWA wrapper. Design. Ethena structures USDe as a delta-neutral synthetic dollar, created by hedging crypto collateral with short perpetuals and futures to target a $1 value. Its yield-bearing asset, sUSDe, distributes net income from funding/basis spreads and collateral returns. Collateral. Ethena backs USDe with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto assets that it can delta-hedge via perps or futures, alongside allocations to liquid stables such as USDC and USDT to support liquidity and stability. The eligible-asset mix is overseen by the Risk Committee and adjusted over time. Scale and yields. USDe is the leading synthetic dollar with a market cap of almost $13 billion by early September 2025, an important signal of institutional acceptance of the model. Its yield is generated primarily from funding and basis spreads on delta-hedged perp/futures positions and, when used in the backing, liquid-asset rewards. After an early period of elevated funding rates in 2024, Ethena’s yield saw compression toward low single-digit annualized yields as more capital competed in the basis trade. Currently, its APY ranges between 6% and 10%. Treasury-backed line. In parallel to USDe/sUSDe, Ethena supports USDtb, a stablecoin backed primarily by BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund, offering a cash-equivalent risk profile and direct mint/redeem mechanics—useful for treasurers who prefer traditional backing. Risk management. Ethena centers its controls on a public Proof-of-Reserves program that delivers weekly third-party checks of backing, coverage, and dollar-neutrality. Monthly custodian attestations further verify the existence, control, and value of reserves. Operationally, the protocol uses off-exchange settlement, so assets remain in MPC custody while hedges execute across venues. Smart contracts have undergone multiple audits, with published reports noting no critical or high-severity findings in those rounds. Design. Elixir structures deUSD as a fully collateralized, delta-neutral synthetic dollar: staked ETH (stETH/wstETH) backs the asset while an equal-notional short ETH-perpetual hedge targets a ~$1 value. A staked counterpart, sdeUSD, accrues protocol revenue to holders. deUSD’s yield comes from a blend of derivatives funding/basis and USDS/sUSDS treasury income, with the APY computed from a 7-day trailing sum of funding rewards and sUSDS rewards (net of EBF fees). Collateral. The core backing combines stETH (paired with short ETH-perps for delta neutrality) and USDS, Sky Protocol’s stablecoin. The project’s team plans to expand the basket over time. Scale and yields. As of early September 2025, public trackers show about $135 million worth of deUSD in circulation. Returns vary with perp-funding conditions and the Sky Savings Rate embedded via sUSDS. RWA rails and integrations. Elixir positions deUSD as infrastructure for tokenized securities to access DeFi: through a partnership using Securitize sTokens, holders of instruments such as BlackRock’s BUIDL can swap into sBUIDL and mint deUSD, while deUSD is accepted as yield-bearing collateral across Elixir-powered order-book venues. Risk management. Elixir publishes a dedicated Risks section (smart-contract, custody, execution, collateral, and regulatory) and implements off-exchange settlement so funds remain in on-chain MPC custody while hedges are executed across centralized venues. Smart-contract reviews include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Pashov, alongside an Immunefi bug bounty. As synthetic dollars move from niche to routine portfolio tools, the choice of protocol increasingly comes down to what you hold, how you earn, and where you operate. We suggest to choose either one of the three approaches: If you prioritize breadth and steady returns in any market conditions, Falcon Finance (USDf/sUSDf) presents the golden middle. It accepts a wide spectrum of collateral, from major stablecoins and large-cap tokens to tokenized treasuries via USTB, and runs a multi-strategy engine (including funding arbitrage, staking, and liquidity deployments) that seeks competitive APY without relying solely on positive funding. It’s a natural fit for treasuries or funds with varied assets, with the usual caveat to check live yields and over-collateralization before sizing positions. If depth of liquidity and broad composability are central to your financial strategy, Ethena (USDe/sUSDe) offers scale and integrations with a well-documented mechanism. Yields are primarily funding and basis-driven, and a separate USDtb line caters to those that prefer a treasury-backed, cash-management profile, making it straightforward to match risk appetite to mandate. Where alignment with order-book venues and RWA rails matters most, Elixir (deUSD/sdeUSD) brings a funding-plus-sUSDS yield mix and exchange-centric plumbing. Current scale is smaller, so venue coverage and on-chain dashboards should guide position size, but the design suits trading-led workflows and RWA connectivity. Overall, the decision depends on collateral mix and yield preferences: Falcon for high-yield and multi-source income, Ethena for scale and funding-centric returns (with a treasury-backed option), and Elixir for exchange-aligned operations with built-in RWA pathways. Synthetic dollars matured in 2025 into a practical category that pairs dollar tracking with measurable, source-backed yield, but designs differ in collateral breadth, strategy mix, and operating scale. Falcon Finance prioritizes competitive APY, wide collateral support and multi-source returns. Ethena offers the deepest footprint with a funding-centric engine and a separate treasury-backed line. Elixir aligns tightly with exchange venues and RWA rails. Selection should follow portfolio needs: what collateral you hold, how sensitive you are to funding cycles, and where you transact, while continuously monitoring live yields, over-collateralization, and transparency disclosures.

Title: Traders Eye September Jobs Report for Cues on Bitcoin Breakout Above $120K
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/01/traders-eye-september-jobs-report-for-cues-on-bitcoin-breakout-above-usd120k

Full Content:
Crypto markets remained unchanged Monday and Tuesday after last week’s $1.5 billion liquidation flush, but traders remain cautious ahead of a critical run of U.S. economic data that could set the tone for October. Bitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out. Total market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound. The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET). “The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk. “This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said. Jobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing. That usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added. Market structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations. “The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.” Kuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.”“On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted. Ethereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review. News around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months. Regulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves. Elsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

Title: 9 Best Social Media Management Tools for Agencies

Manage all your social accounts in one place Find high-quality content and viral post ideas Design images with stock media editing tools Classify your posts into topic-based buckets Compose, customize and preview your posts Automate your social publishing schedule Evaluate post performance and engagement Create and manage posts on your phone Struggling to figure out which social media management tools for agencies are actually worth it? Most tools look great on the surface — until you try to onboard five clients, publish across 10 platforms, and collaborate with your team… all while staying under budget. That’s when the cracks show. You hit limits on users. Scheduling posts takes forever. You still have to chase down content ideas. And don’t even get us started on clunky approval workflows or missing analytics. What agencies really need is a tool that’s: After testing dozens of social media management tools for agencies, I narrowed it down to these top 9 — each ranked by what they do best. Managing multiple clients or brands? You can’t afford to waste hours every week bouncing between content folders, caption drafts, and platforms. That’s where Post Planner shines. It’s a social media management tool built to help agencies find, create, schedule, and recycle high-performing content across every major social network — without the price tag or complexity of other platforms. You can schedule content across: And the best part? It’s one of the most affordable tools on this list (even when you need more users and social accounts). Here's a demo video that shows just how simple it is to use: Post Planner offers 4 main pricing plans: Visit our pricing page for more details on each plan. Post Planner mainly receives 4-5 stars across online review platforms. Customers love the time they save scheduling their posts with Post Planner's easy-to-navigate UI. More critical reviews mention that they wish more advanced reporting features were available. Here's what Aubrey C. has to say about using Post Planner: “This program is an absolute LIFE SAVER. As a person who runs multiple clients, I needed something that saved me time because I work a full-time day job in addition to my freelance services. I was looking for something affordable, user-friendly, and quick to learn on my own. I got all of those things but learning on my own wasn't necessary. The team is extremely responsive via text chat and they have plenty of training. Aside from that, this program helped me optimize my work and the post batching is potentially my favorite part. I love that there's an app for me to use in addition to my desktop. It makes it very easy for me to use no matter where I'm at. On a personal note, the customer service was better than most places these days. They were responsive, supportive, and encouraging, not to mention extremely helpful and kind. A business like theirs will always get my advocacy and money going forward. Many thanks for everything, Post Planner!” If your agency manages lots of clients or publishes across a high volume of social media profiles, SocialPilot is built for you. It’s a robust, client-ready platform with built-in team collaboration, white-label dashboards, bulk scheduling, and approval workflows. Even better? You get a lot of those premium features for less than you’d pay for other enterprise-level competitors. While it doesn’t include content discovery like Post Planner, it’s a great fit for agencies that already have their content strategy dialed in — and need a clean system to manage the execution. SocialPilot offers 4 main pricing plans: SocialPilot mostly receives 4-5 stars across online reviews. Customers love the value you get for the price, especially if they manage a lot of accounts. Finding many complaints was a struggle, although some mentioned occasional scheduling errors. Here's what Nyika S. has to say about using SocialPilot: “I'm happy with it. The pricing is better than Hootsuite which is what I used before; and it's almost as easy to use. I liked how easy it was to 1. add my team members 2. on-board them (platform is easy to learn) and 3. post and schedule content. I can also easily repost content previously scheduled. Pricing packages are slightly rigid- I am in between packages but I have to go with the more expensive one so I don't miss out on features. There is an inability to add a channel the same way you add a team member. I am optimistic this will be added soon.” Sprout Social is the Swiss Army knife of social media management — especially for agencies that need serious reporting, cross-platform coordination, and team workflows. It’s loaded with features: smart inboxes, sentiment analysis, employee advocacy, influencer tracking, publishing tools, and fully customizable analytics dashboards. But all that power comes at a cost. Sprout Social is one of the most expensive tools on this list — which makes it better suited for larger agencies or high-ticket clients where granular insights and premium reporting are non-negotiable. Sprout Social has 4 main pricing plans: Since Sprout Social was one of the first social media management tools, it has collected thousands of online reviews, mostly between 4-5 stars. Customers love that it's loaded with plenty of advanced features like the Smart Inbox and reports. The high cost is one of the few dislikes some customers mention. Here's what one verified user has to say about using Sprout Social: "As a smaller company with a solo social marketer, Sprout enables us to scale our social presence with purpose and ease. The unified inbox is a game-changer - I'm able to see all mentions, comments, and messages across all of our platforms and it saves hours. Implementation was easy, reporting is professional grade and the interface is intuitive. The biggest drawback of Sprout Social is the price. The base cost is already on the higher end, and then crucial features like social listening are locked behind an even more expensive add-on. This is frustrating, because listening is essential for proactive strategy, but it feels like it’s priced for enterprise budgets only. For a tool that does so much right, it’s disappointing that such a core feature isn’t included or available at a more accessible tier. So we have to maintain a separate, more affordable tool to fill that gap." If your agency juggles multiple clients and approval rounds, Planable was made for you. It turns messy email threads and spreadsheet calendars into one simple, visual platform — where your team and clients can draft, comment, approve, and publish content without the back-and-forth. It’s especially useful for agencies that prioritize client collaboration and fast review cycles. Just note: while Planable excels at internal workflows, it doesn’t offer content discovery or curation tools. So it’s better suited for agencies that already have content ready to go. Planable offers 4 main pricing plans: Paid plans come with unlimited users. Planable mostly receives 4-5 stars across customer reviews online. Users commonly praise its collaboration abilities and its simplicity. Meanwhile, one common thing reviewers criticize is its lack of reporting abilities. Here's what Andrea has to say about using Planable: "Planable has truly changed how we manage our content and social media strategy execution. For me, it’s an all-in-one social media management platform that makes planning and scheduling both visual and intuitive. I can see our content calendar, drag and drop posts, and collaborate in real time. I would say that the value of Planable is its efficiency and ease of use. Everything happens in one place. It helps our small team work like a big one: structured, aligned, and fast. I can’t recommend it enough." Hootsuite has long been a go-to platform for agencies managing complex client needs — especially when it comes to customer interaction, social listening, and paid campaign management. What makes it especially strong for agencies is the ability to engage directly with followers across platforms using a centralized inbox, plus advanced features for ad management, sentiment analysis, and employee advocacy. That said, the price tag is steep — and some users report customer service hiccups. If your agency doesn’t need deep listening or paid social workflows, more affordable tools will give you better ROI. Hootsuite has 3 main pricing plans available: Most Hootsuite customers rate it 4 or 5 stars across review sites. Customers value its social media management and team collaboration features. One of the most common complaints is its higher pricing. Here's what Taylor has to say about using Hootsuite: "I am excited about using Hootsuite because of the social media benchmarking and social listening. One thing that I've noticed since using the product is that customer service doesn't respond to chats, the social media platform analytics are not accurate (I have to go to Meta or Linkedin directly for accurate numbers on impressions and likes), and Hootsuite doesn't seem to see when I check the inbox (I got a message recently saying that if I didn't use the inbox within 5 days, the function would be taken away. I use this function every single work day so this is confusing)." If you’re drowning in DMs, mentions, and client check-ins, Agorapulse might be the sanity-saver your agency needs. Its biggest strength? A unified inbox that lets your team stay on top of comments, messages, reviews, and brand mentions — all from one clean dashboard. Add advanced team roles, saved replies, and reporting that ties posts to ROI, and it’s easy to see why many agencies trust it as their main social media management tool. Just know: it’s not cheap, and you’ll need to move to higher-tier plans to unlock features like bulk scheduling. Agorapulse has 4 main pricing plans and a 30-day free trial: Most customers rate Agorapulse 4-5 stars across online reviews. Customers like being able to manage all of their social media DMs in one place and the ability to track brand mentions across social platforms. One of the most common criticisms is the high price point for smaller businesses. Here's what Bianka B. has to say about using Agorapulse: “Agorapulse is an essential tool for social media management. We use it daily at Effet B and particularly appreciate its intuitive interface, comprehensive features (scheduling, moderation, reporting), and the clarity of the reports. The calendar is very well designed, the unified inbox tool saves us valuable time, and the customer service is always quick and efficient. It is a reliable platform that allows us to better collaborate as a team and optimize our social strategies. I highly recommend Agorapulse to any agency or SME looking to structure and simplify their social media management.” If your agency is focused on Instagram growth — especially for visual brands like ecom, beauty, or lifestyle — Later is one of the most polished tools out there. From grid planning and hashtag suggestions to visual drag-and-drop scheduling and link-in-bio tools, it’s built specifically for teams that live and breathe IG content. And while it supports other platforms too (like TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest), many of its best features are Instagram-only. It’s not the most budget-friendly option, and it lacks advanced reporting and content discovery tools — but for agencies that want to nail the look and flow of their clients’ feeds, it’s hard to beat. Later offers 3 pricing plans: Later mostly receives 4-5 stars across online reviews. Users love saving hours by scheduling posts months in advance. Some users mention the price being higher than they'd like and the UI feeling a bit clunky. Here's what Fiona M. has to say about using Later: “Overall experience is 99/100 for Later. I’ve tried other scheduling programs but this is by far the best. Later is so easy to use and the visual grid is excellent - it’s also super easy to manage multiple profiles and multiple client social accounts. There are so many features from drafts to analytics to the linkin bio It’s missing LinkedIn analytics which would make it perfect and I’d love to be able to auto post stories on Instagram but otherwise all good.” Buffer is a clean, intuitive social media management tool that agencies love for one big reason: it just works. If your team values clarity, ease of use, and strong analytics, Buffer delivers. It’s especially great for agencies focused on consistent publishing and reporting — without the distractions of features you’ll never use. You won’t find content discovery or fancy visual planners here. But if you’re managing clients who value strategy, data, and smooth workflows, Buffer is a dependable, low-friction option. Unlike some of the other schedulers on this list, Buffer charges you per channel that you use. Buffer offers 3 main pricing plans: Most Buffer customers rate the software between 4-5 stars across thousands of online reviews. Most users value its scheduling, social media management, and analytics features. On the other hand, users sometimes comment that the UI is a bit funky and dislike the pricing structure being based on channels. Here's what Void D. has to say about using Buffer: "Overall my experience with buffer was really great. I ended up moving to another post scheduler due to the necessity of multiple post queues, but really miss the overall ease of use with buffer. Buffer has a very easy to use interface, and auto-scheduling and reorganizing scheduled posts is extremely easy. The workflow feels intuitive and I never had to pull out the FAQ to figure out how to do what I wanted. The lack of ability to have multiple post scheduling queues for a single social media account. One queue works fine if you only post a single type of content, but having to manually schedule or re-organize the schedule if you have multiple post types (images, video, text, etc) gets really tedious." Onlypult is one of the most underrated social media tools for agencies — especially if you need broad platform support without a bloated price tag. It’s designed primarily for Facebook and Instagram, but it actually supports over a dozen networks (including Telegram, Tumblr, VK, and even Medium). If your clients use a wide range of channels — or if you're managing international brands — Onlypult can help you cover them all. While it lacks modern content discovery and curation tools, it does offer unique extras like a built-in website builder and brand mention tracking. And with scalable pricing for teams, it’s a decent option for lean agencies. Onlypult offers 4 main pricing plans: Onlypult has the fewest online reviews of any schedulers on this list, but of the reviews it has, it mostly gets 4-5 stars. Customers value Onlypult's Instagam-first approach. However, some critics complain that the platform is not as robust as other platforms. Here's what one verified user has to say about using Onlypult: "Using Onlypult, I have managed Social channels easily. For me, it is key the Ig preview and the AI help for the captions I do not like the fact that the pages/profiles of the same client are not really synchronised, so you have to deal them one by one. Also the calendar view is by social media channel, I would prefer a complete view by date. It is a platform for planning, so you can prepare/plan posts in advance."

Once again, it feels as if we’re tiptoeing toward an official war between the United States and Russia — as opposed to the proxy war that has endured for three and half years between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. Although President Trump has downplayed the “rare and urgent” meeting of top military commanders from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, the event has generated intense speculation. The Pentagon says that secretary of War Hegseth merely wants to deliver a speech on the “warrior ethos” and make sure that military leaders are all walking in the same direction. The president describes the focus of the gathering in general terms: “We’re talking about what we’re doing, what they’re doing, and how we’re doing.” Still, to gather the highest-ranking members of the U.S. military in one location for a chat with the president and secretary of War leaves the impression that something of significant importance will be discussed. On Monday morning, ZeroHedge gathered data from several sites that analyze open-source intelligence to predict military engagements. Those sites were all tracking a large deployment of U.S. aerial refueling tankers crossing the Atlantic on their way to Europe. A social media account that tracks pizzerias near the Pentagon showed a spike in orders late Sunday night. The last time these sources noted a wave of air tankers leaving the United States and increased carryout orders from restaurants near the Pentagon, the U.S. military was preparing to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. When these open-source data points are viewed alongside the unusual meeting of top military commanders in northern Virginia, it is difficult not to conclude that a potentially significant military operation is imminent. Notably, there has been a shift in public messaging from high-ranking government officials. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Sunday that President Trump has authorized NATO to use U.S. missiles in direct strikes against Moscow. In a post on Truth Social one week ago, the president stated, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump’s rhetorical departure from months of effort directed toward peace came right after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City. While answering reporters’ questions at the U.N., Trump said that allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter into the airspace of NATO nations. Marveling at the president, Zelensky called Trump a “game changer.” In a separate interview on Fox News, Vice President Vance said that the administration might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Noting that President Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to equip Ukraine with weapons that can strike Moscow, Vance’s assessment of the situation nonetheless suggested that U.S.-NATO is about to take a more aggressive posture in the region. While signs indicate greater U.S. involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the near future, the Russian foreign ministry has been highlighting uncorroborated online chatter claiming that the Ukrainian military intends to use captured Russian drones in staged “false flag” attacks on logistics hubs in Poland and Romania. There are no hard facts to back this assertion, but numerous media reports coming from Hungarian sources have repeated the claim in recent days. Should Poland or Romania be attacked, President Trump’s recent comments suggest that there would be a swift U.S.-NATO response. As is always the case in war, propaganda and misdirection make it almost impossible to analyze this information. Ukraine has an obvious motive to undertake an operation against its allies in an effort to drag U.S.-led NATO into a larger war. Over the last three years, the Ukrainian military appears to have been involved in several attacks on NATO interests — including the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines supplying Russian energy to Germany and the more recent attack on pipeline networks supplying oil from Russia to Hungary and Slovakia — as part of an overall strategy to separate Russia from European Union economic partners. At the same time, it is entirely logical for Russia to flood the information space with allegations of a looming “false flag” attack while carrying out an actual attack of its own. If something were to occur in Poland, Romania, or Moldova in the next few days, both Russia and NATO will accuse the other of spreading disinformation. These competing “narratives” ensure that confusion will reign — ratcheting up the prospect of retaliatory attacks and perilous escalation. I do not like where this is heading. The issue of U.S.-NATO support for the Kyiv government in its fight against the Russian Federation has divided American conservatives. Some Americans view Russia with such hostility that they almost appear eager for a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation. I believe that such a conflict has the potential to kill millions of people and put us on the path toward long-term global instability. Those who rush to defend Ukraine’s territorial borders routinely ignore that the eastern territories in dispute belong mainly to Russian-speaking peoples who have repeatedly allied with the Russian Federation. When NATO and Kyiv deny people the natural right to determine their own future in the name of Ukraine’s national “self-determination,” I find the argument for war ludicrous. This has always been a civil war involving historically Russian areas, and bloodshed began only after Obama’s State Department and European Union emissaries decided to expand NATO’s territorial grip right up to Russia’s doorstep by sacrificing Ukraine in a proxy war. Of all the reasons that U.S. and European politicians provide for the necessity of defending Ukraine, the idea that Russia’s invasion was entirely “unprovoked” is most laughable. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Ukraine has directly attacked property belonging to NATO nations. Nonetheless, NATO appears ready to protect a country that has attacked its members and to attack a country that has not. This has always felt like another expedient “bankers’ war,” meant to put money into the hands of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions while stealing the lives and tax dollars of Western citizens. Over at The Conservative Treehouse, Sundance framed the issue aptly: The reason why the EU member states of NATO want escalated war with Russia is financial and economic. Through policy and ideology, the EU/NATO members have walked themselves into an economic dead end. They are out of assets to leverage. The only way out for the EU/NATO leadership is to create a war to erase debt, expand assets and reset the economics. While BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other World Economic Forum heavyweights divide up Ukraine’s assets and manage control over the Ukraine Recovery and Reinvestment Bank, international financial interests will turn wartime spending into a money machine. At the same time, all the self-inflicted economic damage caused by “green” energy regulations and central bank money-printing propping up the expansive European welfare state can be blamed on “Russian aggression.” Should the whole financial system near collapse, the perfect rationale will exist to implement central bank digital currencies and mandatory digital identities for Western citizens. Once again, governments will manufacture potentially catastrophic problems in order to justify “solutions” that nobody wanted in the first place. In this case, however, the problem that NATO governments are creating comes with the certain loss of numerous lives and the inherent risk of cataclysm. I don’t like this game, and I wish that wiser heads would succeed in preventing this violent calculus from reaching its ever deadlier conclusion. Right now, however, all signs point to madness. It looks as if a wider war with Russia will coincide with Antifa’s war against Americans at home. Prepare accordingly.

Title: Vercel grabs $300M in late-stage funding to fuel its AI pivot

UPDATED 21:25 EDT / SEPTEMBER 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Vercel Inc., the front-end development specialist that enables companies to build and deploy scalable websites quickly, said today it has raised $300 million in a late-stage round to accelerate its transition to focus on artificial intelligence. The company said its oversubscribed Series F funding round was led by Accel and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, with participation from new investors BlackRock, StepStone and Khosla Ventures, raising its valuation to $9.3 billion. As more enterprises come to rely on AI for critical workflows, demand for developer-friendly platforms like Vercel is increasing rapidly, founder and Chief Executive Guillermo Rauch said in a blog post announcing the investment. Silicon Valley-based Vercel made its name helping developers build websites and applications. It’s the creator of Next.js, a popular open-source framework that’s used to build front ends for websites and applications. The company commercializes Node.js through a cloud service that offloads processing tasks usually done in the user’s browser to website operators’ servers. That allows those tasks to be completed faster, which reduces web page loading times. Having established itself as a developer favorite, Vercel has in the last year shifted its focus towards AI development with the launch of its AI Cloud platform. Its main component is a software development kit known as the AI SDK, which provides streamlined access to more than 60 of the most powerful large language models from companies including OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Meta Platforms Inc., Cohere Inc. and others. The AI SDK has proven to be immensely popular, with more than 3 million downloads per week, making it the company’s fastest-growing open-source project, Rauch said. “Just like React brought accessibility to pages, the AI SDK is bringing accessibility to tokens to multiple sources of intelligence,” he added. The company also offers access to AI infrastructure and an open-source vibe coding platform called v0, which boasts more than 3.5 million users. Earlier this month, it debuted its very first AI agent, called Vercel Agent, in public beta. It’s primary task is to automate code reviews, scanning human- and AI-generated codebases, identifying problems and creating fixes for any problems it finds. Its fixes are validated in sandboxed environments to ensure they don’t cause any further strife. “Our bet on open source has become a powerful flywheel, and we’re excited to continue democratizing agents and making them accessible to everyone,” Rauch said. “We’ve evolved as much in this last year as we did in the first nine. Because there has to be a cloud that’s designed and purpose-built for AI applications. Vercel has built this from the ground up with the AI Cloud.” The AI Cloud has helped to ignite dramatic new growth for Vercel, doubling its user base over the last 12 months and increasing its revenue by 82%, off an undisclosed base. Rauch said its customers include some of the leading players in the AI industry, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as big-name enterprises like PayPal Holdings Inc., Nike Inc. and Walmart Inc. Rauch said Vercel will use the funds from today’s round to expand its AI cloud services and enhance the v0 development agent’s capabilities. It’s also set to launch a mobile version of v0 later this month, which will make it possible for developers to build applications using voice and camera inputs. Separately, Vercel is also planning a $300 million secondary tender offer for current and former employees and early investors, which is expected to close next month.

Title: Will institutions follow Bitcoin onto other chains?

Structural changes, such as the approval of altcoin ETFs, might change how Wall Street sees Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The success of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and major BTC treasury companies marked another step in the institutional adoption of crypto. US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs captured $518 million on Sept. 29 and have accumulated $57.3 billion in net flows since their launch in January 2024, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) crossed $80 billion in assets by July 2025, becoming the fastest ETF to reach that threshold in just 374 trading days. Adding to the stellar performance, names such as Harvard Management Co. and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala disclosed investments in Bitcoin through IBIT. The digital asset treasury movement expanded in tandem with the adoption of ETFs. Strategy increased its Bitcoin holdings to 649,031 BTC worth $72.67 billion as of Sept. 29. Meanwhile, Metaplanet up-sized its share offering to $1.4 billion in September to fund aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027. Institutions now face a choice between cold storage and yield generation. Max Gokhman, deputy CIO at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, noted that yield is a major driver for institutional adoption of crypto. And the SEC is clearing pathways for yield through regulated products. On Aug. 6, a staff statement confirmed that liquid staking tokens do not constitute securities by default, while the Sept. 17 generic listing standards expedited crypto ETF approvals. As more altcoin ETFs are set to launch in the US, potentially offering yields through staking, institutions will gain exposure to the returns that crypto has to offer. This change might impact how Wall Street sees Bitcoin. Bitcoin is scattered across 365,958.79 BTC in synthetic forms totaling $41.8 billion as of Sept. 30, according to Bitcoin Layers. As Bitcoin does not have native smart contract capabilities, the idea of a synthetic token, commonly referred to as a wrapper, is to allow the usage of BTC in DeFi protocols built on other blockchains. Babylon leads native staking with 58,271.77 BTC, generating a 0.29% APR through a self-custodial protocol that secures proof-of-stake chains. Using Babylon’s infrastructure, chains and applications can tap a security layer maintained by BTC staking. Lombard’s LBTC token transforms Bitcoin into a liquid staking asset with 0.82% APY and $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), compatible with Ethereum, Base, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Katana, Sonic, Starknet, and Sui through native Chainlink and canonical bridge integrations. Threshold operates tBTC v2 across Ethereum, Starknet, Sui, and MezoChain with 6,335.31 tBTC bridged and $717.7 million in TVL. Solv Protocol offers its solvBTC across 12 chains, including Arbitrum, Mantle, and the Bitcoin mainnet, with $1.7 billion in total value locked (TVL). Meanwhile, b14g offers an average of 5% APR through dual-staking mechanisms that combine BTC with native protocol tokens, across a $300 million TVL. Zeus Network bridges Bitcoin to Solana via the zBTC wrapper, with $58.7 million in TVL using Multi-Party Computation for trustless cross-chain interoperability. It offers 4.52% APY on staking via Fragmetric. Thorchain facilitates native Bitcoin swaps for assets across different chains with $74 million locked. Bitcoin bridges processed $1.87 million in September 2025. Regarding chains with the largest amounts of wrappers, Ethereum holds 178,458.67 BTC as of Sept. 30, followed by BNB Smart Chain at 24,082.67 BTC and Base at 21,647.85 BTC. Besides the wrapper domination in established blockchains, Lightning Network presents itself as a significant rail for BTC usage. Lightning maintains $438 million in TVL despite a 20% decline in public capacity from 5,400 BTC in late 2023 to 4,200 BTC by August 2025. Coinbase reported that 15% of Bitcoin withdrawals were routed through Lightning by mid-2025, and CoinGate documented that Lightning accounted for 16% of Bitcoin orders in 2024, compared to 6.5% two years prior. Additionally, Tether deployed USDT over Lightning via Taproot Assets in January 2025, enabling dollar-denominated payments without locking BTC in channels. Despite the plurality of networks and wrappers that institutions could use to add composability to Bitcoin if they wish to, the key point of access remains through ETFs. Using BlackRock’s IBIT S-1 filing as an example, the document specifies that Coinbase Custody Trust Company holds Bitcoin in segregated cold storage wallets with multi-signature authentication, separate from all other Coinbase assets. In January 2025, BlackRock filed an amendment to IBIT’s structure to allow in-kind creation and redemption, requiring Coinbase Custody to process withdrawals to public blockchain addresses within 12 hours. Currently, there is limited room to incorporate yield pathways into Bitcoin ETFs, which would involve exploring the DeFi ecosystem using BTC. Additionally, the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule mandates financial institutions and Virtual Asset Service Providers to transmit originator and beneficiary identifying information with virtual currency transactions. This standard requires end-to-end transparency to aid law enforcement and mitigate financial crime risks. ETF issuers must maintain segregated custody with regulated entities that are capable of producing audit trails that satisfy the travel rule requirements. Wrapped Bitcoin protocols introduce trust assumptions that conflict with institutional custody standards. Threshold’s tBTC relies on decentralized node operators to maintain the bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a multi-signature custodial model where no single entity controls funds. Although this is positive from a decentralization perspective, it introduces a security dependency on the integrity of the validator set. Lombard utilizes Babylon’s Bitcoin Staking Protocol, combined with a consortium model for custody, which distributes risk across multiple parties. Again, there is an effort to decentralize single points of failure; however, this adds coordination requirements that complicate audit procedures. A Bitcoin ETF holding LBTC on Base would face scrutiny on Optimism’s fraud-proof system, Base’s sequencer centralization, and the bridge’s oracle dependencies. Each wrapped BTC variant trades off security assumptions. BitGo’s wBTC utilizes centralized custody with legal agreements, whereas Threshold’s tBTC distributes custody across validators, who must maintain uptime and adhere to honest behavior. These layered risks multiply audit surfaces beyond what segregated cold storage presents. Babylon’s 0.29% APR on staked Bitcoin compares unfavourably to Ethereum’s 3.2% staking yield or Solana’s 7.1% APY available through liquid staking derivatives. Lombard’s 0.82% return requires institutions to accept exposure to 13 different blockchain networks, each with distinct security models and potential failure modes. These examples reveal the challenge that a 1% yield advantage on a 5% Bitcoin allocation contributes just five basis points to total portfolio returns. Institutions might find insufficient compensation for introducing bridge risk, oracle dependencies, and cross-chain settlement complexity. Franklin Templeton’s Gokhman observed that institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a cyclical, high-beta risk asset that correlates with traditional financial markets as institutional adoption grows. This framing suggests that portfolio managers prefer to separate their Bitcoin holdings from yield generation, maintaining BTC as a pure exposure play while sourcing returns from assets with more established DeFi infrastructure. An institution could hold Bitcoin through IBIT’s segregated cold storage while deploying capital into Ethereum ETFs that will potentially offer staking yields through proven liquid staking tokens approved by the SEC’s August 2025 guidance. Dividing exposure requires allocating capital across multiple positions but preserves custody clarity and simplifies compliance reporting. The alternative of bridging Bitcoin to access DeFi yields forces institutions to evaluate whether Threshold’s node operators or Lombard’s decentralized consortium provides equivalent security to Coinbase Custody’s federally regulated cold storage. Each bridge introduces a new counterparty, and each destination chain adds another risk surface that chain risk committees must review. The fragmented liquidity across 365,958 BTC, spread across different protocols and chains, compounds this complexity, as no single venue offers the depth that institutions require for entry and exit without market impact. In conclusion, Bitcoin layer-2 and alternative layer protocols offer technical solutions for yield generation. However, it is up to regulators to find a way to accommodate these paths into regulated products, and it is up to institutions to decide whether direct exposure is worth the risk.

Title: Czech Elections Could Shift Country Away From Pro-European Path, Impacting Support For Ukraine
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/10/mil-251001-rferl01.htm

By Rikard Jozwiak October 01, 2025 When Czech voters head to ballot boxes this weekend, many fear the country may turn away from its pro-European path, taking away one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters as its battle to repel invading Russian forces nears the four-year mark. Most polls indicate that billionaire Andrej Babis and his populist ANO party will win the parliamentary elections on October 3-4 with around 30 percent of the vote. That means Babis would have to form a coalition government with fringe parties, which would bring the country closer to Viktor Orban's Hungary and Robert Fico's Slovakia in terms of its outlook on Ukraine, potentially stopping aid for Kyiv and becoming less enthusiastic about Czech membership in Western institutions. While not in total alignment with Moscow's positions, Prague would become more vocal on the need to immediately stop the war and aim for peace -- most likely on the Kremlin's terms. Expect less harsh rhetoric toward China as well. Polling and political analyst Michael Ashcroft said in an analysis that the Czechs may join "what is from Kyiv's point of view a worrying trend in Central and Eastern Europe, with the existing stance of the Hungarian and Slovakian governments and the new Polish president much less inclined to defend Ukrainian sovereignty." "The consequences could include isolating Ukraine from Western European partners, disrupting military supplies and sowing further division in the alliance," he added. Just as it did in Moldova -- where elections last weekend saw a massive Russian disinformation campaign try and swing voters away from pro-Europe parties -- the Kremlin has been looking to take advantage of the waning support for aid to Ukraine that has helped fuel Babis's rise back to prominence. A Czech research group uncovered nearly 300 anonymous TikTok accounts aimed at amplifying pro-Russian narratives and backing radical parties in the final weeks of the election campaign. The Center For Research Into Online Risks said in a statement on September 28 that Czech TikTok accounts with millions of followers "are systematically spreading pro-Russian propaganda and support for anti-system parties through manipulated engagement." The center added that the accounts are not tied to a single political entity, instead "combining support for multiple anti-system parties simultaneously." "The cumulative reach of these accounts is 5 to 9 million views per week, more than the combined official accounts of the leaders of the largest Czech political parties on TikTok," it said. Analysts say the key thing to look out for now is which parties gain enough votes to enter parliament as Babis will likely need a coalition to govern. Spolu (Together), an alliance of center-right parties that includes the incumbent Prime Minister Petr Fiala's Civic Democrats is polling at around 20 percent, whereas the other parties of the current pro-Western coalition government Stan (Mayors and Independents) and the Pirates are predicted to end up with 10-12 percent each. All of these parties have said that they aren't interested in entering a coalition with ANO or even backing it with votes to pass legislation as a single-party minority government. But this is preelection talk and the tune could very well change after the vote, especially amid growing fears that more radical coalition alternatives could derail the Czech Republic's pro-Western course. As junior coalition partners, they could demand key posts in the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. Secondly, there are factions in the current government, notably in the Civic Democrats, that share ANO's political positions -- committed to NATO but weaker on EU membership and opposed to euro adoption and Brussels policies such as mandatory refugee quotas and the green deal. But the Central European country could also change radically if Babis teams up with any of the current opposition parties that are even more radical than the ANO. These include the far-right SPD, polling above 10 percent, as well as a smaller far-right outfit AUTO (Motorists for themselves) and the far-left Stacilo (Enough), both of which are expected to clear the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. Governing with any of them would likely lead to a real rapprochement with Orban and Fico, both of whom have been critical of aid to Ukraine and are also in the vanguard of countries in Europe that continue to purchase Russian oil and natural gas despite Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A key figure in whatever comes after the election is pro-Western President Petr Pavel, who plays a role in government formation as well as foreign policy in general. Pavel, a former senior NATO general, has made it clear that he won't allow a government that strays too far from the Western course. Babis has been a constant fixture of Czech politics for the last 15 years, first serving as finance minister and deputy prime minister before leading the country from 2017 to 2021, as well as attempting to become president only to be trounced by Pavel in the 2023 election. One of the country's richest people, with considerable stakes in agribusiness and media, his time in the public spotlight has been dogged by legal disputes and accusations of conflicts of interest and EU subsidy fraud. Yet, it's also his business interests that many believe could keep him, and by extension the Czech Republic, anchored in the West as good relations between the Czech Republic and France, Germany, and Austria as well as the continued flow of EU agriculture and cohesion funds are more important than anything Beijing and Moscow can offer. Babis has chartered a more populist course in recent years and was one of the creators of the biggest populist forces on the continent, Patriots for Europe, a political family also consisting of Orban's Fidesz, Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, Spain's Vox, and Austria's Freedom party. He has also voiced support for Fico's Smer party even though they are not formally part of the Patriots for Europe alliance. Rallying against all things Brussels, environmentalism, and immigration, they would also find sympathetic ears beyond Central Europe with right-wing populists of various hues on the rise or in power in many other Western capitals as well.

Title: Letters to the Editor, October 1st: On disenfranchised voters, Connolly and Germany and leprechauns

Full Content:
Sir, – The presidential election has highlighted to me a serious, archaic flaw in our electoral system. I’m a resident, registered voter, yet I’m legally prohibited from voting. On election day, I’ll be one of a group of 11 eligible voters touring in a music show across Germany. We join the tens of thousands of resident, registered voters abroad on election day who are disenfranchised. Millions more eligible citizens are disenfranchised because they live abroad. Even returning emigrants who arrive after October 24th have no say on who their next president will be. My touring colleagues and I are representing our nation, showcasing the best of Irish culture to thousands of people across Germany. Yet, in doing so, we are stripped of our right to vote. Germany is among the vast majority of democratic nations who have provisions for overseas voting, I wonder what their citizens would make of our disenfranchisement? This all leads to the question, how democratic are our elections when millions of eligible voters cannot exercise their legal right to vote? – Yours, etc, DAVE FLYNN, Composer and musician, 77 Camden Street Lower, Dublin 2. Connolly and Germany Sir, – We are lucky to have intellectuals with “largesse d’esprit” to correct pre-conceived stereotypes of other nationalities and remind us of important facts. Having lived in Germany for 12 years, I was shocked to hear a potential president of Ireland referring to the increase in military spending in Germany as having 1930s fascist overtones. I also find the insular attitude of some people alluding to “Europe” as something apart from Ireland antediluvian. Thank you, Fintan. – Yours, etc, MUIREANN NÍ CHINNÉIDE, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin. Sir, – I read Fintan O, Toole’s article with interest (“Catherine Connolly should keep her inner Basil Fawlty under wraps”, September 30th). He fails to take into account they are human beings with human foibles. Yes, she did make a gaffe, but was it necessary to write a full article on an obvious error? I look forward to reading his articles on Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin pointing out their shortcomings. – Yours, etc, SIOBHÁN FITZGERALD, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir, – Fintan O’Toole questions the language that Catherine Connolly uses to highlight the large increase in Germany’s defence spending and whether it is appropriate of her to do so given Germany’s support for Ireland during the Brexit crisis and the threat of a hard border. A bigger issue than this and what we really don’t see enough discussion of is the volume of German arms exports, especially to Israel. According to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, Germany has been supplying 30 per cent of all Israeli arms imports, making them the second largest supplier behind the US. Additionally, the BBC has reported that German arms sales to Israel has increased ten-fold since 2022. Despite very recently halting the sales of arms to Israel due to pressure, Germany has not only been enabling Israel to commit genocide in Gaza, but also profiting from it. While Germany is a friend of Ireland within the EU, Catherine Connolly is right to call out Germany’s build up of their arms industry and how they are arming parties involved in conflicts, in particular Israel. – Yours, etc, CIARÁN HARRON, Shankill, Dublin. Presidential debate Sir, – The office of Ireland’s president is intended to be non-political. However, at some campaign events, and at Monday night’s debate, candidates were confronted with political policy questions. A candidate is likely to have a personal opinion about such issues, but if elected president they cannot state such views publicly. As president, the person can only offer such statements that coincide with the positions of the government. Reporters should keep this in mind rather than perhaps seeking to catch out a candidate in an awkward position. –Yours, etc. DAN DONOVAN, Dungarvan, Co Waterford. Sir, – Having watched most of last night’s presidency debate on Virgin One a number of thoughts came to mind. Regular political journalists seem to treat it as just another general election and the questions do not seem to relate very much to the office they are seeking. Somebody who understands the role might make a better chair, maybe an historian like Diarmaid Ferriter. A summary of what President Michael D Higgins did over the last 14 years could also help voters understand the role and the candidates could then outline their approach and vision. Discussing how a county council hasn’t built a council house in decades is important, but is for a different forum, I think. I am hoping to enjoy the rest of the debates but would love to be a bit more engaged by the chairs and the candidates. – Yours, etc, PARAIC CORBETT, Shankill, Dublin 18. A Ryder Cup suggestion Sir, – The behaviour of a significant and vocal minority of spectators at the Ryder Cup in Bethpage was very disappointing and unbecoming of a professional golf event. While some have drawn comparisons to scenes at football matches, I believe this analogy is misplaced. In a soccer match, it’s highly likely such disruptive individuals would have been removed from the stadium and banned from future matches. With the 2027 Ryder Cup in Adare Manor already well into its planning stages, now is the time for organisers to implement a formal code of conduct, making adherence to these guidelines a condition of ticket purchase. To start, those responsible for the worst behaviour at Bethpage Golf Club should be advised not to attend. Further measures should include limiting alcohol sales, ensuring that only sober attendees are admitted, and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy towards substance abuse. A dress code should be enforced, with a focus on traditional golf attire and a strict prohibition on any form of nationalist clothing. Additionally, introducing family friendly and alcohol-free areas could provide a welcome refuge for spectators who prefer a quieter, more respectful viewing experience. These areas could offer preferential viewing spots for those with moderate habits, creating a more balanced atmosphere and encouraging positive behaviour. The Ryder Cup has a great history, and it is imperative that contemporary spectators uphold the dignity and integrity of the event. – Yours, etc, DAVID CASSIDY, Dublin 9. Sir, – Surely the US players should have been more proactive in trying to stop the more outrageous behaviour of US “fans?” Sportsmanship? – Yours, etc, TONY WALL, Raheny, Dublin. Neutrality and aggression Sir, – The excellent letters by Brian Girvin and Donal McGrath (Lettters, September 29th) clearly set out Ireland’s vulnerability to any aggressive nation. As in the second World War, countries discovered neutrality was absolutely no defence against an aggressor. At present, various European countries are experiencing “unexplained” incursions by drones and fighter jets. Against this background it is vital that Ireland commits more funds to defending our territorial air space and seas. This does not mean more tanks and guns, but it does mean more high technology tracking and weapon systems and fully trained operators. Sufficient funds must also be committed to ensure all our naval vessels have trained crews and the best equipment. I appreciate housing and health are at the top of the Government’s budget, but the time has come to stop hiding behind neutrality and to take responsibility for our national security. – Yours, etc, MIKE CORMACK, Blackrock, Co Dublin. Penalising poor customer service Sir, – Yet again Pricewatch is on the trail of poor customer service provided by big telecom and airline companies. They always give so-called apologies in the so-called rare events of not meeting their usual so-called standard of care. Perhaps for a start we should be provided with a mandatory phone number for contacting these companies, with the apology made all the more real by having a premium of a euro for each minute over their target time of five minutes payable to their “valued” customers who are kept hanging on for ages waiting for a reply. After all our time is valuable also. – Yours, etc JOHN ROGERS, Rathowen, Co Westmeath. Car-free days Sir, – Your correspondent John Bergin (Letters, September 29th) makes a good point about car-free days and those of us who do not live in Dublin city centre. I have a routine commitment that requires me to be in Ballsbridge every Sunday at 10am. I can just about get there by public transport if I leave my house no later than 7.45am. The first train of the day will get me from Kildare to Dublin Heuston, after which I need to change twice – first to the Luas, then to the Dart – with a combined wait time of almost 40 minutes and a fare of ¤7.50. Alternatively, I can have an extra 90 minutes in bed, leaving my house at 9.15am in the car – for about half the cost. –Yours, etc, RICHARD BANNISTER, Kildare. Bus timetable changes Sir, – I agree completely with Robbie Wells (Letters, September 29th) on bus routes and numbers being changed without adequate notification. It was by chance I stumbled on this online. There was no notice to commuters, no regard for senior or neurodivergent travellers . No one in this community (Firhouse) was aware of it, when I pointed it out . Schoolchildren will be affected, second and third level. Senior citizens too. It seems high-handed , and disrespectful in the extreme. – Yours, etc, MARY McDAID, Dublin. Thinking outside Dublin Sir, – Eugene O’Malley’s proposal for alleviating the housing crisis by building a new town/city 30 miles west of Dublin (Letters, September 29th) is an excellent one. Beginning as a dormitory town for Dublin with a good rail service, this would develop independently with its own infrastructure. Apart from the many practical and political advantages O’Malley mentions, I would add that such a town, from the start, could take account of Ireland’s desperate need of biodiversity. Ebenezer Howard set out the principles for designing Garden Cities in 1898 in which gardens, allotments and surrounding fields would offer not only healthy, biodiverse green spaces, but the ability to grow much of the city’s own food. Many garden cities and suburbs have since been completed since. Such a town, west of Dublin as suggested, should be properly planned and financed and begun as soon as possible. – Yours, etc, TRICIA CUSACK, Co Wicklow. Sir, – Eugene O’Malley proposes a new dormitory town 30 miles from Dublin to relieve housing pressure there (Letters, September 30th). This to me seems but a continuation of the skewed development policy in Ireland towards the east coast. A more balanced plan would see the west being developed, more particularly the Limerick-Galway corridor which already has rail lines and other infrastructure and above all would hopefully dispense with the need for the ruinous Shannon to Dublin pipeline. This year again we have had algal blooms on Lough Derg which according to studies is a result of warmer weather and lower water levels. Do we really need to lower them further? – Yours, etc, ENDA SCANLON, Ennis, Co Clare. Don’t look up Sir, –Environmental headlines almost seem engineered not to pique the average reader’s interest. Last Friday (September 26th), I noticed two articles squashed into the right hand column, one by Caroline O’Doherty highlighting a mass fish kill on the river Blackwater, another by Kevin O’Sullivan titled “Algal Bloom on Lough Derg prompts call for investigation,” both concluding that we aren’t quite sure what happened, but investigations are under way. Human actions are what happened and we don’t need to read about the minutia of inconclusive forensic investigations to understand. What we do need is an active media that actually reports on the climate crisis and stimulates national concern. The following three or four pages detailed sporting achievements – hardly a more pressing subject matter. I urge editors to dedicate more resources and space to the real issues facing humanity. I am reminded too often when reading the newspaper of the 2021 Adam McKay film Don’t Look Up which accurately depicted humanities hypothetical apathy toward an apocalyptic comet heading for earth. – Yours, etc, THEO DILLON, Co Cork. Cross words Sir, – Morning completion of the Boston Globe mini-crossword has become the new normal in my household. You can imagine the consternation that ensued from this particular clue yesterday: “like leprechauns” with the solution being “Irish”. Thankfully, breakfast had been consumed as otherwise I would probably have choked on my muesli with no added sugar. Your Simplex at lunchtime continues apace with no such bombshells. – Yours, etc, FRANK J BYRNE, Dublin 9. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi

After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi

After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information.

Title: Wall Street shrugs off shutdown threat as S&P 500 heads for fifth straight winning month

U.S. stocks coasted to the finish of their latest winning month. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% Tuesday to close out its fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. The quiet trading came as a potential shutdown of the U.S. government loomed. Past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Treasury yields wavered but ultimately held relatively steady following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. U.S. stocks are coasting toward the finish of Wall Street’s latest winning month on Tuesday, as financial markets give a collective yawn for the potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government that’s looming. The S&P 500 edged up by 0.1% and is on track for a fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18 points, or less than 0.1%, with an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was virtually unchanged. The quiet trading came as a midnight deadline approached, when the U.S. government looks likely to shut down because of Washington’s latest political impasse. That’s because history has shown that past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 4.4% during past shutdowns and is positive over the last five, according to Monica Guerra, head of U.S. policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump’s tariffs won’t derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Treasury yields wavered in the bond market but ultimately held relatively steady following a couple mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One said consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents in the Conference Board’s survey pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its “low-hire, low-fire” state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that’s neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more through the end of next year to give the job market a boost. Too-strong data on jobs could make the Fed less willing to cut rates, which would back up criticism that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive after prices ran so high. Too-weak numbers, meanwhile, could signal a coming recession, which would also hurt stock prices. When Wall Street will get upcoming data reports on the job market and inflation is uncertain, though. A shutdown of the federal government would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday’s on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. That could make Wall Street more twitchy when investors are already nervous about the state of the economy and what that means for the potential for cuts to rates. The Department of Labor has already said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there’s a lapse. On Wall Street, Spotify Technology sank 5.4% after the Stockholm-based streaming giant said its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO to become the executive chairman. Two of his lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs: Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström. Oil-related companies weighed on the market after the price of crude fell again as traders see too much oil washing around the world. Schlumberger fell 2.7%, and Halliburton dropped 2%. On the winning side of Wall Street was CoreWeave, which jumped 11.8%. It said Meta Platforms will pay up to $14.2 billion for a new order for cloud computing power made under its existing service agreement, with the potential for more. Lamb Weston climbed 4% after the supplier of frozen French fries and other potato products reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. In stock markets abroad, indexes ticked higher in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.15%, where it was late Monday. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: IBIT flips to in-kind creations: what it means for spreads, taxes and flows

Tighter spreads, tax advantages, and smoother arbitrage: that’s the payoff as IBIT adopts in-kind creations and redemptions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The largest Bitcoin ETF in the world has just revamped its process for moving coins in and out of the fund. BlackRock’s IBIT, which has accrued more than $20 billion since launch, can now process creations and redemptions “in kind.” The SEC’s approval order quietly flipped the switch: IBIT’s authorized participants can now swap Bitcoin directly against shares instead of only taking or delivering cash. While it might sound like a small operating change, the effects could be anything but minor. When spot ETFs went live in January 2024, the SEC required them to be created in cash. If you wanted to buy IBIT, an authorized participant (AP) like Citadel or UBS would sell you ETF shares and wire cash to Coinbase to source the actual Bitcoin. Redemptions worked the same way in reverse: sell ETF shares, get dollars back, and Coinbase liquidated coins to cover the difference. However, this model created a drag. Every creation and redemption process runs through a fiat leg, accumulating transaction costs, custody fees, and, most importantly, tax frictions. APs couldn’t simply shift Bitcoin in inventory: they had to finalize cash sales. That widened bid-ask spreads for large players and opened the door to tracking errors between IBIT’s share price and Bitcoin. In-kind solves this. Now, if an AP needs to deliver 1,000 BTC worth of IBIT shares, it can simply transfer 1,000 BTC from its own balance. Redeeming works the same way: return IBIT shares, receive coins directly, and no forced liquidation. Not everyone can do this. The SEC’s approval order and updated IBIT prospectus name four firms with the privilege: Jane Street, Virtu Americas, JP Morgan Securities, and Marex. These are the desks that already dominate ETF market-making. They now get to skip a step, moving Bitcoin in and out of IBIT’s custodian wallet without having to go through dollars first. That means tighter inventory management, faster arbitrage, and less basis risk. This also means that the spreads on IBIT should compress further. ETFs already trade at pennies around NAV, but with direct coin settlement, the incentive to quote even tighter grows. Then there’s the tax angle. Cash redemptions can trigger taxable events when APs dump Bitcoin to fund withdrawals. In-kind transfers are generally tax-neutral. For institutions managing balance sheets, that’s a meaningful edge. Some ETF lawyers argue it could also sidestep wash-sale complications, since redemptions now involve moving the asset itself rather than cycling cash. The SEC’s order doesn’t settle every nuance, but it makes IBIT look more like a gold ETF: shares backed by a stash of the commodity, with the ability to pull metal (or in this case, coins) on demand. IBIT already dominates the field, regularly pulling in more net flows than all rivals combined. CryptoSlate’s coverage of Farside data shows that IBIT consistently banks hundreds of millions, if not billions, in net inflows, even when its competitors experience losses. By lowering friction for APs, BlackRock may have just sharpened that lead. Cheaper creations mean market makers can quote tighter spreads, attracting more secondary-market volume. Cleaner redemptions mean lower exit costs, which matters to institutions worried about getting stuck in size. Both point toward IBIT becoming the default liquidity pool, with rivals forced to follow if and when they get in-kind approval. Despite the magnitude of the change, everything will likely remain the same to retail investors. IBIT trades the same, with the same ticker and fees. However, under the hood, the switch matters. Tighter spreads should shave basis points off every trade. Better tax treatment reduces hidden costs for large players, and if APs move inventory more quickly, IBIT’s tracking error to Bitcoin could shrink further, improving its pitch as a one-for-one proxy. The broader market effect? Expect more flows into IBIT relative to competitors, at least until they win the same privilege. And regarding Bitcoin’s liquidity, moving coins in and out of the custodian without fiat detours could boost turnover at scale, with knock-on effects for derivatives markets that hedge against ETF inventory. One way or another, BlackRock got the ETF it wanted from day one: a true in-kind Bitcoin fund.

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has good news and bad news for the more than two million global workers employed by his company. The bad news is that AI is rapidly going to transform all of those employees' roles, and soon. The good news is that, in his view, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be out of a job. Also: Nearly everything you've heard about AI and job cuts is wrong - here's why Speaking at a conference in Bentonville, Arkansas, home of Walmart's headquarters, last week, McMillon told the audience that it's by now "very clear that AI is going to change literally every job," according to a Friday report from The Wall Street Journal. Walmart is the largest employer in the world, so when McMillon unequivocally declares his conviction that AI is going to reshape his company from the ground up, that's a vision for the future with ramifications that will be felt by millions of workers globally, at every rung of the socioeconomic ladder. Thus far, many predictions about the potential for AI to transform the job market have focused on white-collar jobs, especially software engineering. Also: Will AI replace software engineers? It depends on who you ask It's true that the growing availability and sophistication of AI coding tools does seem to be one of the factors that's been making it more difficult for young computer science grads to find work in the tech industry. At the same time, however, the race among tech companies to build ever-more powerful AI models has also sparked a talent war that has hugely inflated the salaries of some of the industry's more established engineers. Some new AI tools, especially those that are designed to generate video, could also replace many creative roles in industries like filmmaking and advertising. Also: OpenAI tested GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini on real-world tasks - the results were surprising McMillon's prediction, however, paints a much more unilateral and democratic picture of the future of AI-powered automation: it isn't just salaried office workers who will feel the effects of AI, but also warehouse workers, checkout cashiers, and millions of others, many of whom are already working paycheck-to-paycheck. That said, his vision for the future is more about transformation than replacement. In his view, as business leaders rush to onboard new AI tools, they also have a responsibility to provide the requisite upskilling to workers. "We've got to create the opportunity for everybody to make it to the other side," he said at the Bentonville conference. Also: Got AI skills? You can earn 43% more in your next job - and not just for tech work This language portrays AI not as a giant ax that will cleave many workers from their livelihoods, but as a moment of societal change -- a chasm which executives should help their employees cross safely. In the absence of robust federal oversight of AI, the onus of responsibility for managing the technology's impacts upon the labor market will likely fall disproportionately on employers' shoulders. The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, a set of policies released earlier this summer, emphasized AI upskilling without outlining any protections for workers displaced by the technology. McMillon's stance is supported by recent data from Indeed, which indicates that AI is transforming specific job requirements more than it's replacing jobs themselves. Similarly, a recent report shared exclusively with ZDNET found that only 11% of executives surveyed believe that AI will significantly reduce their workforce, while 84% said they expect the technology to alter the nature of existing roles within their companies. Elsewhere, recent research from OpenAI found several frontier models performed competitively with human experts on economically viable work tasks that contribute to US GDP. Also: The best free AI courses and certificates in 2025 - and I've tried many In that same vein, Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon (the second-biggest employer in the world) recently told CNBC that AI will lead to "fewer people doing some of the jobs," while also creating new ones.

Bitcoin and Ethereum fuel broader market rebound as sentiment gradually shifts. Bitcoin and Ethereum pumped by more than 2% on the day following massive institutional and whale purchases. The broader crypto market reflected the bounce, rising by a percent. Its sustainability depends on continued capital inflow into the digital assets. The last 24 hours have seen the whole of the crypto market bounce by 1%, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] leading. The pair surged by over 2%, regaining previously lost key price levels. With only a day left until the last quarter of the year begins, sentiment is starting to shift. Whales and institutions have set the tone after almost two weeks of market correction across most of the coins. The shift in sentiment in the last 24 hours has resulted from several factors. SEC chair, Paul Atkins, affirmed his stance on making crypto his number one priority to fuel innovation in the United States. This induced confidence among crypto enthusiasts at a time the market was struggling. Institutions and whales were also loading up more BTC and ETH. Bitcoin Spot ETFs saw $518M in inflows, which is 4.6K BTC. ETH broke its 5-day ETF outflow streak as it received $546M in capital injection. Fidelity bought $299 million worth of BTC and $202 million worth of ETH, as per Whale Insider. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) added over $20M BTC, taking the firm’s holdings to slightly more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Source: Arkham/ BlackRock (IBIT) also purchased $154M in BTC. On top of that, IBIT dethroned Deribit as the largest BTC options venue, with its Open Interest (OI) at $38 billion against $32 billion. For Ethereum, whales were closing short positions as they reverted to accumulation. The market rebounded, resulting in over $1.58M in losses for one whale, as per Lookonchain data. On buying, a new wallet by BitMine added $107M ETH. A whale also added $21M in ETH from the OKX exchange. On the charts, Bitcoin rose above $110,000, with the price reaching $114,000 at the time of writing. However, the BTC was seeing some rejection, with Crypto Tony predicting a pullback to $113,000. Looking ahead, price needed to break above $115K for a continued surge. If prices fail to stay above $110K, they could retest lower levels. Source: CryptoTony/X Ethereum also reclaimed the key support level at $4,000 that had been lost. Price briefly dipped below this mark and was now targeting the resistance at $4,250, which would allow for further upside. If the altcoin failed to stay above $4,250, the drop could be repeated.

Title: The 10 Strongest-Performing Mega-Cap Stocks Of 2025

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions. On top of that, tight expense control and smarter use of capital drove higher returns and profitability. Its growing consumer and private-wealth businesses added another layer of stability, helping smooth out earnings in what’s often a cyclical industry. 10. Philip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris International, best known for its iconic cigarette brands, has been reshaping itself into a broader smoke-free and nicotine-focused company. That transition gained real traction in 2025. The company’s heated tobacco and vaping products continued to win over consumers, driving growth even as traditional cigarette volumes declined. Strong demand for its IQOS platform and other reduced-risk products helped boost both revenue and margins. At the same time, Philip Morris managed costs tightly and generated solid cash flow, which supported dividends and buybacks—key priorities for investors. The result was a more balanced, forward-looking business model that’s less dependent on traditional tobacco sales. Key themes tying these names together Risks and watch points ConclusionThese are the 10 strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. For the most part, these companies are able to grow their earnings, revenue, and have predictable cash flow. While each stock carries company-specific risks, the ten strongest stocks in 2025 reflect the strongest mega cap stocks in 2025. Barring some unforeseen sell off, these stocks can continue to lead as we head into Q4 and beyond. Disclaimer: These are not buy ideas & no investment advice is being given.

Title: A quarter of bosses admit their return-to-office mandates were meant to make staff quit

Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs. Bosses have spent the better part of two years summoning their employees back to the office, making remote-loving workers “quiet quit” in protest, while others have threatened to quit for real. But that’s secretly what a significant chunk of CEOs were hoping for. According to research from BambooHR, a survey of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found a quarter of C-suite executives hoped for some voluntary turnover among workers after implementing a return-to-office (RTO) policy. Meanwhile, one in five HR professionals admitted their in-office policy was meant to make staff quit. It’s why the report concludes what many workers have long suspected: that “RTO mandates are layoffs in disguise.” It’s no secret that rigid in-office policies haven’t landed well with workers. Amazon is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get. Around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand. When the tech giant eventually demanded workers show face in the office five days a week, numerous staffers told Fortune they were immediately updating their LinkedIn profiles and “rage applying” for new jobs. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” one person said. Research has shown 99% of companies with RTO mandates have seen a drop in engagement. Meanwhile, separate data shows that nearly half of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated, and 29% of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment. BambooHR’s research has further highlighted that nearly a third of workers would consider leaving their positions if forced to return to their company’s towers. But in reality, many workers aren’t following through with such threats—and fewer are quitting than bosses had hoped. Nearly 40% of all managers in the survey said they believe their organization did layoffs because not enough workers quit in response to their company’s RTO mandate.

Payments giant Stripe and corporate spend management player Brex have unveiled products that bring stablecoins closer to the mainstream. 2 Likes 2 30 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Stripe has unveiled Open Issuance, a platform that lets businesses launch and manage their own stablecoins with just a few lines of code. The company notes that businesses are adopting stablecoins quickly, with total supply growing 57% in the last 12 months. But by building on coins issued by external providers, they’re unable to reap all the potential benefits. For example, a neobank that sits on large stablecoin dollar deposits doesn’t retain the yield itself. When its customers want to redeem their stablecoins for cash, they’re subject to burn fees. Open Issuance - powered by Bridge, the stablecoin platform Stripe recently acquired - is designed to make it easy for firms to mint and burn coins freely, and customize their reserves to manage the ratio between cash and treasuries and choose their preferred partners. Treasuries are managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Superstate. Cash is held by Lead Bank to provide liquidity as necessary. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don't build on top of someone else's coin,” says Zach Abrams, CEO, Bridge. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Separately, Brex will soon let customers with a business account accept stablecoins with automatic conversion into USD in their accounts and send stablecoins directly from their USD balances. In addition, customers will be able to pay their card balances with stablecoins. “Stablecoins make it possible to move millions of dollars across borders in seconds, but using them typically requires fragmented workflows and managing multiple platforms,” says Pedro Franceschi, CEO, Brex. “With today’s launch, forward-looking companies across industries, from AI to crypto, will manage their largest payments and mission-critical expenses on Brex, in a single, secure platform.”

Title: Dynamic Discounting: How to Do Dynamic Pricing Right

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Dynamic pricing doesn’t have to turn off customers. Wharton’s John Zhang says companies can correct perceptions of unfairness by clearly communicating the value. Z. John Zhang Z. John Zhang The following article was written by Wharton marketing professor Z. John Zhang. Dynamic pricing isn’t new. Airlines, hotels, and ride-hailing companies have long relied on it to balance demand and supply, maximize profitability, and serve different types of customers. But in 2025, dynamic pricing is spreading rapidly across industries — from grocery retail to fast food to fashion e-commerce to tickets for the upcoming FIFA World Cup — powered by artificial intelligence, digital price tags, and real-time demand data. The current tariff uncertainties and inflation concerns are further impetus for firms to flirt with, and even embrace, dynamic pricing. Done right, dynamic pricing can benefit both firms and consumers. Done poorly, it can trigger backlash and erode trust. The economic logic is straightforward: Customer willingness to pay varies. It varies across customers, and for the same customer, across occasions and over time. A family booking a vacation months in advance has a very different willingness to pay than an executive booking a same-day flight, and almost everyone is willing to pay more for roses on Valentine’s Day than on any other day. Dynamic pricing helps companies capitalize on this variation, charging a high-willingness-to-pay customer a high price and a low-willingness-to-pay customer a low price at the right time. In the airline industry, leisure travelers secure affordable tickets by booking early, while business travelers can still find seats at the last minute, albeit at a higher price. Uber’s surge pricing — which is a specific type of dynamic pricing — not only helps match riders to drivers but also attracts more drivers into busy zones, increasing supply when it’s most needed. The principle holds across industries. When prices reflect demand and capacity in real time, resources are allocated more efficiently, and customers often have more choice. Firms, of course, stand to reap more short-term profits by charging more to those who are willing to pay more, while accommodating those who can afford to pay only a low price, thus getting both high margins and high volumes for their products or services. Although consumers often conflate them, dynamic pricing and surge pricing are not the same. Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the price of a good or service up or down over time, with some business objectives in mind. Surge pricing is a specific type of dynamic pricing in which a company raises the price of a product or service, unexpectedly for consumers, when demand exceeds supply. It is not surprising to see that several industries are experimenting with new forms of dynamic pricing: History offers cautionary tales. Coca-Cola’s 1999 experiment with vending machines that raised prices in hot weather drew swift backlash, with critics calling it exploitative. The company shelved the idea in the U.S. Wendy’s recent surge pricing announcement triggered a similar outcry and provided a good lesson on what can go wrong with introducing dynamic pricing. Even FIFA’s announcement about future dynamic pricing did not go unnoticed, drawing a New Yok Post headline, “World Cup’s dynamic-priced tickets will cost an arm and a leg — and ruin the global game.” Wendy’s case is worthy of some special attention. In early 2024, Wendy’s CEO Kirk Tanner announced the company’s intention to invest $20 million on high-tech menu boards that can change prices in real time. This means that a Dave’s burger can cost more during busy times like lunch and dinner. The intention here is not a bad one. By charging higher prices at busy times, Wendy’s can shift some of the demand to less busy times, reducing the peak-load staffing as well as some stress for its workers. In addition, with a smaller lunch or dinner crowd, customers would spend less time waiting for their orders at peak times. However, the prospect of dynamic pricing was immediately interpreted by the media and the public as an Uber type of surge pricing for burgers, and it was taken as another example of a greedy corporation trying to exploit customers. Critics noted that unlike Uber, higher prices don’t magically create more burgers at lunchtime and hungry customers get the short end of the stick. Not surprisingly, significant negative public reaction ensued, with “#BoycottWendys” trending on social media. The lesson: Consumers instinctively do not like dynamic pricing or understand it. They resist when it feels like opportunism and when it is not clear what is in it for them. Even in the airline industry, where customers are long used to price variations, dynamic pricing has fueled perceptions of unfairness, making airlines a perennial symbol of consumer frustration. The fact of the matter is that customers have nothing to fear about dynamic pricing. Basic economics dictates that when all following three conditions are present, it is a non-brainer for a firm in any industry to embrace dynamic pricing. First, customer willingness to pay for your firm’s product or services varies over time. Second, your firm has the capability to identify when a customer is willing to pay a high or low price. Third, your firm finds a good way to communicate and implement dynamic pricing without alienating customers. Your firm can avoid alienating customers if dynamic pricing improves access, availability, or fairness for them. The first condition is generally satisfied when: The second condition is always achievable if a firm is willing to make sufficient investments in information gathering, processing, and displaying technologies. Big data and AI capabilities have certainly motivated many firms to look in the direction of dynamic pricing today. But capability alone isn’t enough. Firms must anticipate customer reaction, communicate transparently, and frame price changes around value creation rather than profit extraction. For this reason, the third condition is critical to the success or failure in implementing dynamic pricing. Coming back to Wendy’s PR disaster, the company clarified later that they had “no plans” to raise prices when demand is high. It wants to use its digital menu boards to offer discounts and other value offers during slower periods, not to charge more during peak times. In other words, Wendy’s never wanted to embrace surge pricing, and it intended to offer what I called “dynamic discounting.” Unfortunately, that intention was lost in communication, partially due to the fact that Wendy’s was not clear about it. With dynamic discounting, a firm starts with a fixed regular price and offers variable discounts. Such a mechanism can generate any price point that dynamic pricing can. For instance, Wendy’s can charge its price for Dave’s burgers dynamically, $6 at 11 a.m. to noon, $8 at noon to 1 p.m., and $7 at 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. However, when framed as dynamic discounting, the regular price for the burger becomes $8, and Wendy’s can offer $2 off at 11 a.m. to noon, and $1 off from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Dynamic discounting is then much more palatable to customers because nearly everyone gets a trophy. “Everyone gets a trophy” may not be the smartest idea in competitive sports, but it can help to endear customers to dynamic pricing. Similarly, with dynamic discounting, Coca-Cola could have easily set its regular prices based on hot weather and offered colder weather discounts to avoid consumer backlash. FIFA can use it to shift media and customer focus away from speculating on outlandish prices “for a top-tier seat for the July 19 final at East Rutherford, New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium.” Dynamic pricing is becoming a competitive necessity. The fact of the matter is that customers have nothing to fear about dynamic pricing. If anything, dynamic pricing shifts power to savvy consumers. Those who monitor fluctuations, book at the right time, or shop across platforms can consistently secure lower prices. In a dynamic pricing world, knowledge is power. Stock prices are dynamic. Because of it, savvy investors can buy low and sell high. For goods and services without such cycles, consumers still benefit from dynamic pricing in many ways. For instance, Amtrak tickets between Philadelphia and New York can vary from $10 to $200, and informed buyers can exploit the swings by being vigilant and diligent. Without dynamic pricing, Amtrak would have to charge a much higher everyday price to everyone, its train service would become much less accessible, and trains would run with many more empty seats. Yes, under dynamic pricing, some consumers will inevitably pay higher prices. However, when done right, the consumers who face higher prices will also be the ones who could afford to pay more and get more in return. For instance, business travelers can pay more and will pay more under dynamic pricing. In return for the higher prices, they can get a last-minute ticket or a ticket on a convenient schedule any time business calls for a trip. If you are still not convinced that you will benefit from dynamic pricing as a consumer, you may feel much better hearing that the cumulative profits for the airlines industry since the deregulation in 1978 are zero or slightly negative. This is the industry that pioneered dynamic pricing in modern times and that always stays on the cutting edge of the craft. With all the pricing sophistication the industry can muster, it fails to reap more profits because dynamic pricing has fundamentally changed the game for the industry to the benefits of all consumers. The best analogy I can use to explain the situation is American boxing. The basic rules for American boxing are that you can use only two fists and punch opponents only above the waist. However, in Thai boxing, you are allowed to use your two fists as well as two feet and punch and kick the opponent anywhere. It’s definitely a more competitive and bloodier game, as the opponents have more flexibility and more weapons to hurt each other. Ironically, while dynamic pricing gives an adopting airline the advantage of using more price points (equivalently both fists and two feet) to compete against the opponent staying with conventional pricing (two fists), the advantage disappears when the opponent also adopts dynamic pricing. When all airlines use dynamic pricing, they are playing Thai boxing instead of American boxing — each opponent has more pricing points and flexibility to steal rivals’ customers. Not surprisingly, more sophisticated dynamic pricing may offer an adopting firm some fleeting unilateral advantages, but its collective use will benefit consumers and society at large. Dynamic pricing is becoming a competitive necessity. But the winners won’t just be those with the most sophisticated algorithms. The true winners will be the companies that deploy it responsibly: balancing profitability with fairness with customers in mind, designing transparent systems, and ensuring customers feel served rather than squeezed. Customers will accept volatility if dynamic pricing is rooted in supply-and-demand logic, not in opportunism, and if customers feel they also get more from it. Customers will feel they’re getting more if you frame dynamic pricing as dynamic discounting. Sign up to stay informed about our latest article releases.

The layoffs will span multiple functions and countries, including customer service and sales. Europe’s largest food delivery company said it is increasingly using automation and AI, shifting many manual service tasks to automated systems. Plans to cut around 250 jobs, approximately 30% of its workforce, as part of a push to become a leaner, faster, and AI-focused company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Tel Aviv-headquartered freelance services marketplace said the restructuring will reduce management layers and position it to pursue growth with an AI-native approach. Is closing its Tel Aviv development center, cutting about 80 jobs. Led by Yosi Taguri, the office specialized in software, data, and AI research, including algorithm development. The California-based recruitment firm, founded in 2010, is trimming costs amid a challenging labor market. Has laid off at least 100 employees, including junior developers, just months after cutting nearly 200 jobs. The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, raised $60 million in equity and debt in July. Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs, according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing.

Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. Is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings. Is laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system. Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200. The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in. Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people. Is cutting 100 jobs, and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing. Amazon is reorganizing its audio operations, moving Wondery’s audio-only podcasts under Audible and placing video-focused shows into a new Creator Services division. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. Has cut 150 roles in customer service and support, following enhancements to its platform and tools that have significantly reduced support needs. The decision came via a prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar urged Australia to embrace an “AI revolution” and move beyond “jobs of the past” in an Australian Press Club address. The Australian software firm was founded 2002. Is cutting about 7% of its workforce, or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports. The decision follows the recent acquisition of a startup with around 30 staff, who will stay on with the company. Despite the cuts, the blockchain software company that operates the popular digital wallet MetaMask says it will continue hiring for select roles. Is shutting down operations, per a report by Business Insider. The social collaging platform aimed at creators was founded in 2019 and raised $9 million in funding. Its closure highlights the persistent challenges social media startups face in building user bases and achieving long-term growth. Is laying off around 200 employees — roughly 14% of its workforce — and severing ties with 500 global contractors. The cuts come just weeks after Meta brought in the data-labeling startup’s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal. Plans to cut more than 100 U.S. full-time jobs, about 3% of its workforce, including positions at its Morrisville, North Carolina, campus. As of February 2024, the PC maker employed around 5,100 workers in the U.S. Is reportedly planning to lay off nearly 2,400 workers in Oregon, which is almost five times more than what was announced earlier this week. Last week, Intel announced that it will lay off more than 500 employees in Oregon, which is about 20% of its workforce, per Bloomberg. Plan to eliminate approximately 1,300 jobs combined as part of a larger restructuring effort to combine their operations and focus on AI. The layoff will mostly affect employees in the U.S., particularly in the R&D, HR, and sustainability teams, according to an internal memo by Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba, the CEO of Recruit Holdings, which is the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor. Has laid off 29 employees as part of its reorganization, per a report by Blockworks. The Seattle-based research and engineering startup recently launched EigenCloud, a platform that provides blockchain-level trust guarantees for any Web 2.0 or web3 application. The reduction will affect 25% of the company’s workforce. Eigen Labs said it had raised $70 million in tokens from a16z Crypto in June. Will cut 9,000 employees, which is less than 4% of its global workforce across teams, role types, and geographies. The reduction follows a series of layoffs earlier this year: It cut less than 1% of the headcount in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. Is laying off 65 employees in Bellevue, Washington, according to media reports. The parent company of TikTok arrived in Seattle in 2021 and has been expanding its presence there by growing its TikTok Shop online shopping division. Announced on June 30 that the company is cutting 300 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, as part of organizational restructuring within its sales and support divisions amid the AI shift. The startup is an Amsterdam-based location tech startup that provides navigation and mapping products. Has reduced its headcount by approximately 140 employees, accounting for roughly 1% of its total workforce. The recent layoffs mostly affected Rivian’s manufacturing team. Announced in an SEC filing that it will cut approximately 240 jobs, or 30% of its workforce, to enhance operational efficiency and allocate the resulting savings to the development of new products and technologies, according to a CNBC report. The layoff will help the online dating app save $40 million annually, per the report. Has reportedly laid off 85 employees, which accounts for approximately 40% of its workforce. The Vancouver-based startup sells software products that use artificial intelligence for business intelligence. It helps sales professionals at tech companies gather information on competitors to improve their sales. Has downsized its smart TV division by 25% of its 300-member team to adjust its strategy, per reports. Funding for the smart TV division, including Google TV and Android TV, has been cut by 10%, but investment in AI projects has been raised. Says that it plans to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry division starting in July. Intel Foundry designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients. Intel’s total workforce was 108,900 people as of December 2024, according to the company’s annual regulatory filing. It also confirmed to TechCrunch that it plans to wind down its auto business. Announced that it is letting go of around 90 employees, with 40 in Israel and 50 in Poland. The most recent round of job cuts comes after the Israel-based gaming company laid off 50 employees a few weeks ago. Has let go of around 25 employees from the 58-person team, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Evernote’s founder Phil Libin launched the video startup in 2020, offering Airtime Creator and Airtime Camera. Is laying off more employees, just a few weeks after announcing a job cut of over 6,500 in May, which was around 3% of its global workforce. The most recent layoffs affected software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels. Plans to downsize its workforce by letting go of 68 employees, approximately 4% of its total staff, per Reuters. The San Francisco telehealth platform said that its layoffs were unrelated to a U.S. ban on producing large quantities of the weight-loss drug Wegovy. The startup said it intends to keep on recruiting employees who fit in with its long-term expansion plans. Is reportedly laying off around 100 employees from its devices and services division, which encompasses various businesses like the Alexa voice assistant, Echo smart speakers, Ring video doorbells, and Zoox robotaxis. The company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 since the start of 2022 to cut costs. Will cut over 6,500 jobs, affecting 3% of its worldwide workforce. As of June, the Seattle-headquartered company had a total of 228,000 employees globally. It would be one of the company’s biggest layoffs since it cut 10,000 employees in 2023. Reportedly plans to let go of 248 employees, or about 22% of its workforce, to reduce expenses and improve efficiency, it said. The San Francisco-based edtech startup, which offers textbook rentals and tutoring services, has seen a drop in web traffic for months as students opt for AI tools instead of traditional edtech platforms. Is reducing its workforce by 13% as part of a reorganization that aims to reduce costs, shore up margins, and streamline its organizational structure. Is laying off 5% of its global workforce, or around 500 people. The company said the layoffs were part of “a strategic plan (the ‘Plan’) to evolve its operations to yield greater efficiencies as the Company continues to scale its business with focus and discipline to meet its goal of $10 billion in ending [Annual Recurring Revenue]” in its 8-K filing.

Title: 11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025)

Josh Pack, the co-chief executive and managing partner of Fortress Investment Group, died unexpectedly at 51. Forbes examined Vanguard’s recent push into actively-managed bond funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 30, 2025 Fortress co-chief executive dies, aged 51 “The company, which is majority-owned by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala investment arm and counts high-profile European chains such as Curzon Cinemas and Majestic Wine among its portfolio, announced his death in a statement on Monday night. No cause of death was given.” (Financial Times) Why Index Fund Giant Vanguard Is Pushing Actively Managed Bond Funds “And while Vanguard may not be thought of as a hub for Wall Street bond whizzes like Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Capital or PIMCO, its performance has been hard to match. According to Vanguard, 44 of its 48 active bond funds with a 10-year history outperformed their peer group averages.”(Forbes) SEC Directs ETF Share Class Applicants to Follow Dimensional’s Lead “In a Monday afternoon call with more than 100 representatives from asset managers representing most of the other applicants, SEC staff said firms will be expected to update their filings to look ‘substantially the same as’ Dimensional’s updated version, submitted last Friday, according to Kevin Gustafson, partner at K&L Gates, who was privy to the call. That directive affects the nearly 80 fund firms that have filed requests to use the multi-class structure since Vanguard’s patent expired in 2023.” (ETF.com) 4 Ways Your Clients’ Biases Are Costing Them Money “The technical side of tax-efficient investing is a known quantity, but the human side is far more complex. The most successful advisors understand that their biggest job is not to be a financial whiz, but to be a behavioral coach.” (Morningstar) Prosecutors Urge Court to Reject Ken Leech Calls for Cherry Picking Examples “Prosecutors this week hit back against demands for specific examples in its fraud case against Western Asset Management's former co-chief investment officer, arguing that the defense's objections misrepresent the government's strategy.” (FundFire) Public/Private Fund Liquidity: What You Need to Know “When new money stops coming in, managers may restrict or suspend withdrawals to avoid selling assets at inopportune times. This move, though, often erodes investor trust and signals serious trouble for the fund.” (Morningstar) Why “Downside Protection” ETFs Don’t Protect Portfolios As Well As A Stock-Bond Mix (In The Long Term) “Ultimately, downside protection ETFs can serve a niche purpose, such as holding short-term funds earmarked for near-term goals where principal protection is critical and the investor is comfortable sacrificing upside. But they are not a true substitute for equity exposure, and their complexity can mask the relatively modest benefits they offer compared to more traditional fixed income strategies.” (Kitces.com) The ETF Boom: Quality over Quantity “Should the market be concerned about this rapid pace of issuance or the sheer number of ETFs? Looking beneath the surface, the number of ETFs doesn’t tell the whole story. Most new ETFs have AUM: for those launched since 2024, the average AUM is about $230 million, but the median is only $25 million. In fact, roughly 875 have less than $50 million in AUM, underscoring that many launches fail to attract significant assets.” (JP Morgan Asset Management) BlackRock PE co-head: Semi-liquids could facilitate model portfolio adoption “Semi-liquid fund structures allow private market exposures to link into model portfolios more easily, according to Jonathan Seeg, global co-head of BlackRock Private Equity Partners.” (Private Equity International) Nuveen Aims To Raise $3B For Private Farmland REIT “The firm said that new farming technology, the expected growth in global demand for food and scarcity of undeveloped farmland will boost land values, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.” (Bisnow) CAIS adds 17 private markets firms to its advisor menu “The CAIS Marketplace menu expansion includes strategies from Ares Management, AQR, BlackRock, Blue Owl, Coller, Eldridge, Fortress Investment Group, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Golub Capital, Kayne Anderson, Kennedy Lewis, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Eaton Vance, Nuveen, Veritas, Vista Equity Partners and others, officials announced this week. In total, roughly 70 firms are now participating on the CAIS platform that offers over 150 funds.” (Alternatives Watch) Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: Trump Is Filling the Fed with Loyalists

Federal Reserve Jared Dillian | 9.30.2025 12:15 PM Council of Economics Chair Stephen Miran was confirmed as a Federal Reserve governor just before September's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The impact was immediate—and troubling. Miran dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, and he put a dot on the dot plot—the Fed's survey of members' interest rate expectations—that was 150 basis points lower by the end of the year. Miran wants to lower the federal funds interest rates by 200 basis points immediately, which is well outside the consensus at the Fed. Miran wants huge interest rate cuts at a time when the stock market, cryptocurrency, and gold are at all-time highs, credit spreads are at all-time lows, the unemployment rate is only 4.3 percent, and gross domestic product just came in at 3.8 percent. His logic is that the labor market is weakening—it is, slightly—and he wants to cut interest rates to forestall a recession. But with financial conditions so easy, and inflation hovering around three percent—above the Fed's two percent target—an interest rate cut at this juncture makes no economic sense and risks stoking significant inflation. Miran has made statements in favor of Fed independence in the past, yet his actions now undercut that principle. President Donald Trump has explicitly called for interest rates to be lowered to 0.5 percent, he has installed his man at the Fed, and his man is doing his bidding. This is highly unusual. In the past, it has been political conservatives who have been hard money advocates, consistently pushing for higher interest rates and for fighting inflation. Now the liberals are the inflation fighters and the conservatives believe that a politically active Federal Reserve has been blocking the White House's agenda. One possible reason for Trump and Miran's intransigence on lower rates could be that they are trying to lower the cost of funding the U.S. government. T-bill issuance has been at an all-time high, first under former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and then under Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. By lowering short-term interest rates, the Fed would effectively be lowering the amount of interest that the government would pay on its debt. But this is not the purpose of the Federal Reserve. The Fed is supposed to set interest rates and the money supply to equilibrate inflation and unemployment—its two mandates. Lowering the cost of funding the government is not part of the Fed's mandate. Bessent, for his part, is waiting for long-term interest rates to drop to term out the debt and lock in lower interest rates at longer maturities. This is a dangerous game, as the Fed's actions could actually cause long-term interest rates to rise. Trump now has one loyalist on the Board of Governors, and he will soon have more. It seems likely that Lisa Cook will be replaced, and Jerome Powell will depart as chairman in 2026 (although Powell will have the option to stay on the board). It's not hard to envision a group of Trump's Fed officials acting as a voting bloc, lowering interest rates to near zero and keeping them there even as inflationary pressures build. This is the monetary policy of Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan. It has not worked out well in Turkey, where inflation has skyrocketed and the value of its currency has plummeted. This is the reason that central banks are supposed to be remote from political pressures. Politicians always prefer that the economy run hot to keep people employed. But a "fast" economy is not necessarily a "good" economy. During Alan Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, the Fed prioritized vigilance on inflation. By contrast, the 2010s Fed focused on countering post-crisis deflation, showing far less concern about rising prices. The Powell Fed had to fight inflation in 2021–2022, and it did so incompetently. Absent Trump, the Fed would not have cut interest rates two weeks ago, and it would not be considering future interest rate cuts. Inflation is still high, and the economy can tolerate higher interest rates just fine—there is no compelling reason to lower them. Meanwhile, the search continues for a new Fed chair, and other candidates are being considered, including former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, who probably understands the bond market better than anyone but is clearly politicking for the job by advocating a 50 basis point cut at the last meeting. Low interest rates may be good for borrowers, but they are terrible for savers. There are trillions in money market mutual funds earning about four percent. If those yields disappear, people will be pushed into buying things like high-yield bonds or stocks, perhaps at the worst possible time. This would be an unprecedented experiment: slashing rates while the economy is already running hot. Start your day with Reason.

Title: Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs

The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

Title: Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs

The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

Title: SEC To Allow TradFi Stocks to Trade Onchain

Time Published: 2025-09-30T16:04:42Z

Written byLandon Manning Edited byMohammad Shahid The SEC reportedly plans to allow TradFi stocks to trade onchain by means of RWA tokenization. This would enable retail investors to bypass several key restrictions and use a Web3-native stock trading experience. Although it’s unclear when the rollout will happen or how ambitious it will be, the Commission is reportedly making this a priority. We could see a permanent transformation to TradFi markets in the next few days. The SEC has had a lot on its plate since beginning its newest pro-crypto initiatives, working on new ETF listing standards and regulatory innovation exemptions, among many other concerns. However, a new report details a particularly ambitious goal, as the Commission plans to allow TradFi stocks to trade onchain: BREAKING: The SEC is reportedly moving to allow stocks to trade like crypto, where stocks would trade on-chain.Under the plan, investors could buy tokens on crypto exchanges that represent shares of companies like Tesla or Nvidia. This news comes via a recent report, and it could have bombshell implications. The SEC’s proposed mechanism for bringing stocks onchain is fairly simple: it would offer tokenized RWAs. This would allow retail traders to purchase tokens whose value is directly linked to TradFi stocks like Tesla, Nvidia, or any of the other “Magnificent 7” tech firms. In other words, crypto investors would gain several distinct advantages. They could move their assets around 24/7/365, independently of TradFi’s market hours. This would also allow users to bypass regular brokerage institutions on the stock market, conducting business solely on Web3-native exchanges. BlackRock has been exploring RWA tokenization to bring TradFi stocks onchain, but its experiments were localized to ETFs. The SEC, by contrast, would open these services to a much wider range of products. It’s currently unclear if the Commission plans to launch a pilot program with a few stocks, or a laissez-fair approach where exchanges could list whatever assets they please. In any event, it plans to effectuate a concrete rollout “quickly.” The SEC is under political pressure to adopt a lot of different pro-crypto measures, but this onchain stock program seems like a particular priority. After all, the Trump administration is interested in TradFi/Web3 integration, putting economic data on the blockchain last month. Hopefully, the SEC will release an official announcement with more in-depth explanations soon. Putting Magnificent 7 stocks onchain would already be a huge market opportunity, but a total free-for-all could transform TradFi markets forever.

Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's USDH and MetaMask's mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. "If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don't build on top of someone else's coin," Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. "With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them." Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. "With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy," Will Gaybrick, Stripe's president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on "pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream."

Title: Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says electricians and plumbers will be needed by the hundreds of thousands in the new working world

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Gen Z keeps being told their chances of landing a job are slim as AI threatens entry-level jobs. But in reality, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says, there are thousands of jobs for young people, thanks to an accelerating boom in data centers. They just have to be willing to go to trade school. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’ve going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” And Huang is not just talking about the need—he’s backing it up with cash. The chipmaker announced last week that it was investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund the development of data centers based on Nvidia’s AI processors. Industrywide, global capital spending on data centers is projected to hit $7 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey. A single 250,000-square-foot data center can employ up to 1,500 construction workers during its build-out—many earning more than $100,000, plus overtime—all without requiring a college degree. Once complete, about 50 full-time workers maintain the facility. But each of those jobs spurs another 3.5 in the surrounding economy. Huang’s call for more electricians and plumbers aligns with his broader view that the next wave of opportunity lies in the physical side of technology rather than the software. When asked earlier this year what he would study if he were 20 again, Huang admitted he’d lean toward disciplines rooted in the physical sciences. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen, that’s graduated now, he probably would have chosen…more of the physical sciences than the software sciences,” he said. Fortune reached out to Huang for further comment. Huang isn’t the only CEO sounding the alarm about a looming shortage of skilled trades. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he raised concerns with the White House—arguing that deportations of immigrant labor, combined with a lack of interest among young Americans, are creating a perfect storm for data center construction. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said at an energy conference in March. “We just don’t have enough.” Just this week, Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed those concerns, pointing to the gap between Washington’s reshoring ambitions and the workforce to make it a reality. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?” The U.S. is already short 600,000 factory workers and 500,000 construction workers, according to a June LinkedIn post from Farley. And while the U.S. Department of Education has made the expansion of skilled trades programs a priority, some Gen Zers are already catching on. Take Jacob Palmer, a 23-year-old from North Carolina. After graduating from high school, he decided college was not the right fit. Instead, he joined an apprenticeship program at a contracting firm and trained as an electrician. By 21, he launched his own business—and last year grossed nearly $90,000. This year alone, he’s already hit six figures. Unlike many of his peers facing student debt and uncertain job prospects, he said simply: “I don’t owe anybody anything.” Have you made a successful career out of skilled trades?

Title: Solstice Finance Launches USX, Solana-Native Stablecoin With $160M TVL

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Solstice Finance, an on-chain asset management protocol backed by $1 billion investment firm Deus X Capital, has officially launched USX, its Solana-native stablecoin, alongside the YieldVault Program. The launch marks a significant step for the Solana ecosystem, bringing a purpose-built stablecoin designed for native yields, transparency, and seamless composability. At launch, over $160 million in total value locked (TVL) has been deposited into the protocol. The initiative has secured backing from leading institutions, including Galaxy Digital, MEV Capital, Bitcoin Suisse, Auros, and Deus X Capital. Stablecoins have become a cornerstone of DeFi; however, most of the dominant assets in the sector were not initially designed for the Solana ecosystem. According to Solstice Finance CEO and Co-Founder Ben Nadareski, this has resulted in liquidity flowing out of Solana to other ecosystems in search of stronger yields. Commenting on the development, Ben Nadareski, CEO and Co-Founder of Solstice, stated: “Legacy stablecoins maintain majority market share, yet not a single leading stablecoin was born natively on Solana, and no dominant yield-native stablecoins currently exist in the ecosystem. We see stables often being bridged to other chains for best-in-class yield – that’s stable TVL leaving our ecosystem to try and earn elsewhere. We built USX, addressing this market gap on day one, a stablecoin that maintains all of the frictionless transaction benefits while giving access to institutional-grade yields that are native to the protocol.” Lily Liu, the President of the Solana Foundation, noted that the launch of Solstice opens new doors for developers, investors, and everyday users within the ecosystem. She emphasized that by bringing sustainable, real yield on-chain, Solstice is helping to reinforce Solana’s standing as a premier destination for defi. Several key components anchor Solstice Finance’s ecosystem. At its core is USX, a synthetic stablecoin that is fully backed with a 1:1 collateral ratio and secured through real-time Proof of Reserves provided by Chainlink. Complementing this is the YieldVault, the protocol’s flagship yield engine, which leverages delta-neutral trading strategies to deliver steady returns. In 2024, the vault achieved an annual performance of 21.5% and has maintained a flawless track record with no monthly losses since its inception. Looking ahead, Solstice plans to introduce SLX, its native utility token, designed under a community-first model that deliberately avoids venture capital allocations to prioritize long-term alignment with its users. Behind these innovations stands an expert team of more than 30 contributors with backgrounds from leading organizations, including Solana Labs, Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, BlackRock, Deloitte, and UBS, bringing deep experience from both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. Holders of USX can deposit into YieldVault and receive eUSX, representing their share of the protocol’s net asset value. This setup enables both retail and institutional participants, from $5 wallets to $50 million funds, to access transparent, delta-neutral yield strategies in a permissionless environment. Currently, Solstice is collaborating with over 30 ecosystem partners to drive integrations that further expand Solana’s DeFi opportunities. Solstice Finance is a decentralized finance protocol developed by Solstice Labs AG, a Deus X Enterprise company, in partnership with the Solstice Foundation. The protocol combines licensed fund management with innovative DeFi tools, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Its core offerings include USX, the Solana-native stablecoin, and YieldVault, a yield-bearing protocol designed for institutional-grade returns. Beyond DeFi, Solstice Staking AG, an affiliated infrastructure provider, secures over $1 billion in assets across more than 9,000 validator nodes, making it one of the most trusted operators in the staking industry.

Title: The Future of Labor in Retail | Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino

Time Published: 2025-09-30T14:00:32Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Professors Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino look at how labor affects the grocery industry. Marshall Fisher Santiago Gallino Dan Loney Listen to the podcast. Grocery is one of the toughest segments of retail to turn a profit. Wharton’s Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino talk about the headwinds faced by both small and large grocers. This episode is part of the “Future of Retail” series. Dan Loney: We are at an interesting time in the labor markets. The economy is pretty strong, but technology is playing a larger role in the day-to-day operations. How to manage a staff plays a big part in the success of the firm. A recent report by two Wharton professors looks at the state of retail labor using the grocery industry as the main example. Pleasure to be joined by Marshall Fisher, who’s a professor of operations, information and decisions here at the Wharton School, and also Santiago Gallino, who’s an associate professor of operations, information and decisions as well as an associate professor of marketing here. Gentlemen, why the focus in terms of understanding more about the labor market with the grocery area specifically? Santiago Gallino: I think the interest came because labor — in retail in general, and grocery is no exception — is one of the main expenses that retailers have, together with inventory. I think that over the years, there has been a lot of effort in optimizing inventory and thinking about that. But relative to inventory effort, staffing has been understudied. And that’s where we thought it was an opportunity to help retailers. Marshall Fisher: The other interesting thing that was happening is growth in dot-com. Grocery had been sort of a laggard. Right? Grocery was a bit slow, until along came this thing called COVID in 2020. Nobody wanted to go into a store anymore, so online surged. Grocery had to get better at that. We wanted to look at how well they were doing. What grade would you give them, Santiago? About a D? They had this wonderful, innovative model, where you place your order online and at no charge to the customer someone goes into the store and picks it for you, which roughly doubled the labor cost and and eliminated all profit they were earning. Loney: It is interesting when you think about grocery and how technology has changed a lot of the dynamics not only in the checkout area, but also in placing the order. Is the expectation that technology will continue to evolve retail labor in grocery as we move forward, just like we’re expecting more and more technology to come into our lives? Gallino: Yes, I agree with that. I think what we are going to see as we move forward is many of the technologies that are already available will become good investments. I think that is a driver of what retailers are incorporating over time. Many of the things that are new today here in the U.S. have been in place in Europe, in certain countries, for many years. This is mainly because the ROI of those technology investments have been justified several years ago in countries like Norway or Sweden and now, because of the pressure, are reasonable investments here in the U.S. I think that that has been a driver of incorporating technology on the operational side. Many of the technology we see is new, but others have been around for a while. It’s just waiting to be a good investment to be acquired by the retailers. Loney: Marshall, if the numbers and the information you’re seeing in the grocery segment with how they’re handling their labor — should we expect it to be the same across all kinds of retail businesses? Fisher: Yeah, absolutely. As I mentioned before, some segments of retail are ahead in moving to e-commerce. Apparel would be somewhere in the middle. Obviously, books, video, and consumer electronics are ahead of the game in terms of moving online. Grocery’s the laggard. So I think grocery’s learning from other segments, rather than the other way around. Santiago mentioned technology. It’s worth a minute or two to talk about, what’s the technology? The part that’s easy is having the customer place an order online. What’s hard then, is fulfilling that order. As we mentioned, the thing that was easy for grocery retailers to ramp up when COVID hit was just pick from the store. There’s been an emergence of automating the picking process. Walmart has done a pretty good job. What they put in place are mega warehouses. Sometimes it’s an enlarged back room of the store, so they can have the same inventory for filling an online order as servicing the store. They’ve automated the picking from the warehouse of a subset of the items, and then whatever doesn’t lend itself to automation, like fresh product, they’ll pick from the store, put that together and ship it out to the customer. That’s sort of the frontier of online grocery, is getting better and better at the picking and fulfillment process. Loney: Is the expectation that the online part of the grocery will continue to grow? I say that because grocery is one of those unique things for some of us— and I am like this— I still like to go into the grocery store and see my products and pick them myself. There are those people, though, that are already at the point where they feel comfortable just ordering online. Fisher: And they’re called young people. Loney: Yes, that’s right. Fisher: Will it grow? Sure, as a greater and greater percentage of the population grew up with the internet, they feel comfortable doing that. Gallino: Another challenge it is that when there is a stock out in the order, in other categories, this is less critical than in grocery. Because if you are trying to fill up your basket and milk is missing, you will need to go to the store anyways. If you are buying apparel or some thing, you can wait. That’s not a big deal. You can still do 100% of the transaction online. And I think that that puts, I will argue, an extra pressure for grocery retailers to fully convert customers to the online experience. Loney: Is e-commerce delivering the ROI that the owners of these grocery chains expect, Santiago? Gallino: I don’t think so. That is a great question. And every time I try to get an answer from grocery retailers, the answer is very elusive in bringing the idea of long-term profitability, long-term strategic approach. It’s telling me that in the short run, this is a painful process. Some of them are not losing money anymore with the online grocery channel. But it’s clearly, in my opinion, the less attractive channel for them to fulfill an order. I will say that if a grocery retailer can choose, they would much rather like you to go to the store, because that’s a more profitable transaction for them. Loney: Marshall, with the addition of all of these components of technology, how does that change how the grocery, as a company, thinks about their employees? Fisher: I’ll answer your question with a comparison of two retailers and two executives at those retailers that have a connection to Wharton. So Costco, Richard Galanti, who retired this year, was CFO. Wharton undergrad. Spent 30 or 40 years in that job of CFO. Described his job as doing whatever the CEO didn’t want to do, including the earnings calls. Marc Lore was in the MBA program. Did the first year, and then somehow found starting companies was where his heart was, and created Jet. Left, sold that to Walmart, headed to Walmart.com. Two different approaches. Walmart, under Marc — and this gets to your profitability question. When he took over, they were losing about a $1 billion a year in dot-com. One of the things he was most proud of is that loss steadily declined until now they break even or maybe earn a small profit on dot-com. But he was once interviewed with the head of Walmart stores. And they asked him, “How do you two guys relate and get along?” And Marc said, “Oh, it’s very simple. He makes the money and I spend it.” But he is proud, through innovations he put in place, that that loss has come down to break even or small profit. And Walmart’s stock price earnings ratio tripled as they moved to dot-com. Dot-com retailers trade at higher multiple, right? And was it profitable for them? Yeah. You’d have to say so. Now, Costco trades at 55 times earnings, and they’re the opposite model. Their dot.com penetration rate is minuscule, about 5%. And you think about, why is that? They have not run out of room for growth with the traditional store model. They realized that they have to improve their dot-com game because people want to buy online. And they’re doing that. But up till now, they’ve said, “Thanks very much. We don’t need dot-com.” Loney: Santiago, what do you expect these changes are going to do to grocery as we move forward? Gallino: I think that we are going to see a revival of the physical store in grocery. I think that some of the players, as Marshall was explaining, are able to leverage the scale and play a game that incorporates not just the fulfillment of the order but some kind of advertisement revenue that comes from their online efforts. But others, the smaller players, will lean on the physical store and experience. I will argue that old customers and young customers always appreciate a good in store experience. And I think that there are good examples in grocery where the number of stores is growing. Aldi, with a completely new format in the U.S., is growing very, very rapidly. You can call it traditional, boring stores. But when they’re not boring to customers that are willing to make the trip and go to the physical store. So, I will anticipate in the coming years a revival of the physical store. Fisher: And Trader Joe’s might be an example. They don’t dot-com. If you want to buy from Trader Joe’s, you go to the store. And they seem to work pretty hard at not making it boring. Loney: Santiago, you mentioned a little bit ago about the difference between stores here in the U.S. and other countries. Part of this research was looking at what grocery is like in other countries. Tell us about that side of the story. Gallino: Yes, I think it’s interesting to compare that and look outside. The main driver of the experience in different countries, I will argue, is the hourly rate that employees get in the stores. If you go to places like Latin America, the employees in the store are very abundant. Why? Well, because labor is relatively cheap. Customers like to see employees, and the retailer can afford that. So, there is a lot of that kind of first-hand experience interaction with employees in the store. Europe, on the other end of the spectrum, like I was mentioning before, has incorporated a lot of technology and has pushed the efficiency of the store in terms of labor to an extreme. That drives the experience of the customer, too, in this format. Size, the frequency of the visit. In Europe, most customers will walk to the store to buy. They buy small baskets, and that drives the format of the store. I think that sometimes we need to remember that the driver of the format is a combination of the customer expectation and the labor market conditions. Fisher: I just want to mention one thing and follow up to what Santiago was talking about. Costco, in some ways, in their labor practice, looks more like a European retailer. They pay their people well. Really well. You go into a Costco store and you’ll see someone who’s been there for 20 years. I think their turnover is like 6% a year. Other grocery formats in the U.S., the turnover is about 60% a year. So we’re talking about store labor. The Costco model is really impressive in all kinds of ways.

Title: These Small, Unloved Companies Are The Next Big Dividend Plays
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/09/30/these-small-unloved-companies-are-the-next-big-dividend-plays/

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Small caps are (finally!) back, but most people are in the dark about how to tap them for serious dividends. But there is a proven way to do that—one that puts a rich 7.1% payout squarely on the table for us. Everyone has missed this one. We’re going to dive into it today. The main reason I hate to see people ignore small caps—especially now—is that, well, their time has come. As you can see, It’s been a solid decade of small-caps delivering, well, small profits to investors. But it’s time for the script to flip. In fact, it’s already happening: After years of being dusted by big caps, small caps are matching them point for point this year—even pulling ahead, going by the performance of the benchmark iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) in orange above, over the last three months. I see that continuing. For one, small firms tend to have close, personal relationships with clients, keeping their loyalty—and small firms’ sales along with it—strong. Moreover, they tend to be domestic, so they directly profit from the US economy’s strength (which we discussed in last Thursday’s article) and get a hedge from global headaches (including on trade), too. Of course, there are drawbacks to buying these “small fry”: For one, unless the company is near where you live, say, or factors into your work life, you probably don’t know much about it. That’s unlike, say, big caps like Microsoft (MSFT), which get loads of analyst and media coverage. Another, of course, is the dividends. Many small caps are earlier in their growth process—and if they’re lucky, on their way to becoming tomorrow’s large caps. Unfortunately, this means many can’t afford to both fund that growth and pay dividends. This is why, for the most part at my CEF Insider service, we’ve focused on closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold large caps and high-yield bonds. Not only have they delivered bigger gains than small caps, but they’ve been handing us high, steady dividends, too. You get a sense of that when you compare the average CEF yield—8.3%—with the payout on the small-cap benchmark iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM): a mere 1%. Still, every rule has its exception. When it comes to small caps, that exception is a CEF called the Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). This fund (in orange below) has closely tracked small caps, but with a twist: It “translates” small cap gains into dividends—7.1% payouts, to be exact. The power of a fund like RVT is in its structure: the managers at Royce Investment Partners invest in many different small caps—488, to be exact. Its three top holdings are IES Holdings (IESC), Assured Guaranty (AGO) and SEI Investments (SEIC). Note this chart: IESC (in blue above) installs electrical and technology systems for businesses and had $2.9 billion of sales in its latest fiscal year. Revenue soared 16% in the latest quarter on strong data-center growth (no surprise there). Meantime over at financial firm SEIC (in orange), EPS jumped 70% and revenue jumped 8% in the latest quarter, driven in part by higher interest in alternative investments. As for financial-insurer AGO (in purple), the firm saw net income rise 32% in the last quarter as municipalities continued rolling out bonds at a record pace. All of these stocks’ gains are pushing up RVT’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), putting a lift under its share price. Royce’s job is to take profits on its winners and use its gains to buy up-and-comers and maintain its 7.1% dividend. Now, to be sure, RVT’s dividend does float a little. That’s because it has a mandate to pay dividends at a yearly rate of 7% of the average of the last four quarters of NAV (calculated at quarter-end). So if NAV rises, payouts do, too. I like this payout strategy because it means the fund is not bound to a fixed payout and has flexibility to reinvest gains in other opportunities where it sees them. And even with that flexibility, RVT’s dividend has been remarkably consistent (and even up modestly) over the last five years: Moreover, RVT is still available at a 9.2% discount to NAV. That markdown has momentum, too, up from double digits in late August. Given that RVT’s discount shrunk below 6% in January, before tariff fears sent it plunging in the spring, we still have potential for upside on a closing discount here. The bottom line is that RVT has been doing a good job of “translating” small cap gains into 7% dividends for a long time. That’s why, as small cap momentum ramps up, we see the fund as a good one in which to slowly build a position. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Wall Street coasts toward the end of another winning month

Time Published: 2025-09-30T13:57:20Z

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks coasted to the finish of their latest winning month on Tuesday, as Wall Street yawned at the potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government that’s looming. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close out its fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 81 points, or 0.2%, to set its own all-time high, and the Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher. The quiet trading came as a midnight deadline approached, when the U.S. government could shut down because of Washington’s latest political impasse. That’s because history has shown that past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 4.4% during past shutdowns and is positive over the last five, according to Monica Guerra, head of U.S. policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. What could make this shutdown different, though, is that the White House may push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump’s tariffs won’t derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Treasury yields wavered in the bond market but ultimately held relatively steady following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One said consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents in the Conference Board’s survey pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its “low-hire, low-fire” state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that’s neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. But too-strong data on jobs could make the Fed less willing to cut rates, which would strengthen criticism that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive after prices ran so high. Too-weak numbers, meanwhile, could signal a coming recession, which would also hurt stock prices. When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, though. A shutdown of the federal government would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday’s on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. That could make Wall Street more twitchy when investors are already nervous about the state of the economy and what that means for the potential for cuts to rates. The Department of Labor has already said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there’s a lapse. On Wall Street, CoreWeave jumped 11.7% after saying Meta Platforms will pay up to $14.2 billion for a new order for cloud computing power made under its existing service agreement, with the potential for more. Lamb Weston climbed 4.3% after the supplier of frozen French fries and other potato products reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. On the losing end of Wall Street was Spotify Technology, which sank 4.2%. The Stockholm-based streaming giant said its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO to become the executive chairman. Two of his lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs: Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström. Oil-related companies weighed on the market as the price of crude fell again as traders see too much oil washing around the world. Baker Hughes sank 3.6%, and Schlumberger fell 2.1%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 27.25 points to 6,688.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 81.82 to 46,397.89, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 68.86 to 22,660.01. In stock markets abroad, indexes ticked higher in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.15%, where it was late Monday.

Title: BlackRock’s Canada Bitcoin ETF opens securities lending: More yield, new risks?

iShares Bitcoin ETF’s new lending initiative seeks to balance risk and reward through stringent safeguards and collateral requirements. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has confirmed that its Canadian arm has granted securities lending for the iShares Bitcoin ETF from Aug. 25 after providing investors with the required 60-day notice. The move follows disclosure in the June 26 prospectus, which outlined how the fund may engage in lending transactions in accordance with Canadian securities laws. The decision aligns it with other iShares ETFs in Canada, many of which already rely on securities lending to generate incremental income. Securities lending allows a fund to loan its holdings, such as shares or other securities, to borrowers, typically financial institutions, in exchange for collateral and a lending fee. Borrowers often use these securities to cover settlement gaps, meet collateral requirements, or support short-selling strategies. By opening IBIT to securities lending, BlackRock is effectively broadening the ETF’s revenue sources while emphasizing that protections will be in place to mitigate risk. BlackRock launched its Bitcoin product in the Canadian market in January. The fund allows investors to hold exposure to the flagship digital asset in Canadian and US dollars. It manages around CAD $358.9 million (equivalent to US$257 million) in assets. According to the prospectus, BlackRock Canada has appointed two affiliates as lending agents for the fund, including BlackRock Institutional Trust Company (BTC), based in San Francisco, and BlackRock Advisors (UK) Limited (BAL), headquartered in London. Under the structure, borrowers must post collateral worth at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities. That collateral may take the form of cash or other securities, which are marked to market daily. BlackRock also provides a borrower default indemnity, committing to replace any securities not returned in the event of borrower failure. To limit exposure, no more than 50% of a fund’s net asset value may be on loan at any time. Cash collateral, when received, can only be invested in highly liquid securities with maturities of 90 days or less. The program will be supported by BlackRock’s internal risk management team, which uses proprietary technology and quantitative models to monitor exposures. The firm emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate sensitivity when investing cash collateral, reflecting an approach designed to safeguard against market disruptions. Despite the safeguards, securities lending introduces risks that could impact holders. Some of these include borrowers’ delays or failures to return securities, potentially preventing the ETF from participating in corporate actions such as mergers or dividends. Market conditions could also lead lending agents to scale back activity, reducing potential revenue. Furthermore, shifts in tax or regulatory rules may alter the treatment of loaned securities, delaying or reducing payments owed to the fund. Still, BlackRock stresses that collateralization above 100% and its indemnity arrangement reduce the chance of investor loss. The policy ensures that, even if a borrower defaults, BlackRock should be able to restore its portfolio without a material impact. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: End Of Quarter Review & What’s Next For Stocks?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/30/end-of-quarter-review--whats-next-for-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-09-30T12:54:45Z

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. At the end of every month, quarter, and year I like to step back and review what actually happened in the market. That helps me remain objective, review my work, look for areas where I can improve, remove my cognitive (a.k.a. emotional) biases, and helps me set the stage for what may happen next. That said, here are a few points that jumped out at me as we wrap up Q3 2025. Bulls Are In Control The big headline for me is that the bulls are in control. The stock market is trading at/near record highs and has overcome literally ever negative headline that came out this year. Big picture, that tells me the bulls are in control and, barring some unforeseen event, we are likely headed much higher. 2025 Year In Review2025 began with President Donald Trump returning to the White House for his second term. In January, few could have predicted the dramatic economic journey that would unfold over the next few months. The early days of 2025 were characterized by a palpable sense of anticipation, excitement, and a little confusion about how tariffs would impact both Main Street and Wall Street. Trump’s inaugural address signaled a return to economic nationalism, promising to redefine America’s global economic position. Investors and economists watched closely as the administration began implementing a series of bold economic policies that would send ripples through global markets. Stocks fell hard in February and March as confusion reigned supreme. President Trump unveiled the most comprehensive tariff package in modern American history. The sweeping economic measures targeted multiple global economic powers, with actions against many of our major trading partners. The tariffs were unprecedented in their scope and intensity, covering everything from technology and manufacturing to agricultural products. Stocks Fell In Q1 The immediate market reaction in February and March was pretty severe. The S&P 500 fell 20% within a few weeks, with global markets experiencing similar dramatic declines. Economists warned of a potential recession, and investors braced themselves for what seemed like an impending economic warfare. The financial world held its collective breath, wondering if this would be the moment that would unravel the global economic order. Stocks Rallied In Q2 & Q3 But the market had other plans. In a remarkable display of resilience, the stock market bottomed in April 2025 after Trump lowered and extended global tariffs. The administration dubbed it "Liberation Day." Remember, the market is a forward looking mechanism and knew that the economy was strong and we would recover. Many areas of the market and leading stocks soared over the next few months. The S&P 500 vaulted 38% from April’s low to September’s record high. Tech and AI stocks led the charge higher with investors pumping trillions of dollars into the market. Tech stocks became a primary driver of economic innovation. Breakthrough developments in AI, quantum computing, and renewable energy technologies created new economic opportunities. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing saw massive investments, signaling a strategic shift towards technological self-sufficiency which is important for President Trump. It was also very impressive to see the market race higher even after many of Trump’s tariffs went into effect in the summer. That illustrates how strong the market is right now. Fed Cuts Rates In other, but also important news, The Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in years, even as the stock market hit fresh record highs. Inflation came down a bit and the jobs report got weaker in Q3. The fact that the Fed is cutting rates is bullish for both Main Street and Wall Street. Looking forward, the Fed said it will cut rates a few more times and, as always, it remains data dependent. Geopolitical Tensions Geopolitical tensions continued to play a significant role throughout the year. Ongoing negotiations with China, challenges in European markets, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East didn’t stop the bulls from buying stocks. Once again, the American market demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and innovate in the face of these challenges. IPO Environment Is Improving A few years ago, the IPO market contracted and dried up. That changed in 2025, so far the IPO and startup landscape has improved and looks promising. Despite initial market turbulence, venture capital continued to flow, and more stocks IPO’d this year. Small & Mid Cap Stocks Woke Up It was also encouraging to see the rally broaden out as small and mid cap stocks began to rally in Q3, after being dormant for most of 2025. While large-cap technology stocks dominated the headlines, the small and mid-cap stocks began to wake up in Q3. They were dormant for Q1 and Q2 but they came to life in Q3 after the Fed opened the door to cut rates. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was negative and unchanged for most of the year on a year-to-date percent change basis, but it is now up 9% in 2025. Most of those gains came in Q3. The same is true for mid cap stocks. They were negative to flat for most of the year and then they came to life and rallied in Q3 2025. Looking Ahead The stock market is trading near record highs as we wrap up Q3. That is very encouraging and tells me we can easily continue to race higher. Of course, anything is possible and we can always pullback. Looking forward, we will likely have another correction at some point but as long as we remain above the 50 day moving average, the bulls remain in clear control. We are in a bull market and in bull markets surprises usually happen to the upside, not the downside.

Title: US senators target H-1B, L-1 visa loopholes in new bipartisan reform bill

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/30/2025 5:13:28 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Two of the US Senate’s most senior lawmakers are once again teaming up to overhaul America’s high-skilled H-1B and L-1 visa systems, saying companies have turned what was meant to be a tool for innovation into a loophole for outsourcing. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dick Durbin reintroduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. This latest push comes just weeks after US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping presidential proclamation on H-1B visa applications.

Earlier, the senators sent letters to 10 major employers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, questioning why they were filing thousands of visa petitions even as they laid off American employees. "Congress created the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes as limited pathways for businesses to acquire top talent when it can’t be found at home," Grassley said in a statement.

Volatility may rise if official data gets delayed or news from Washington keeps traders on edge.

Title: EA’s $55 Billion Buyout Sets New ‘Going Private’ High Score

The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic, but its rapid growth didn’t continue once consumers could go outside and touch grass. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Video game-maker Electronic Arts has agreed to go private for $55 billion in the biggest-ever buyout of a public company. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, along with private equity firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, will pay $210 per share to EA’s investors. That’s nearly 25% more than what the stock was worth before The Wall Street Journal reported details of the deal on Friday. EA has been making popular titles like “The Sims” and “Madden NFL” for decades. But recent years have left the company floundering like a Sim in a pool with no ladder. The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic, but its rapid growth didn’t continue once consumers could go outside and touch grass, en masse, again. EA contracted with the broader industry, reducing its workforce through several rounds of layoffs, shutting down development studios and canceling games. The company’s stock experienced its biggest single-day slide in 17 years in January after executives slashed annual bookings guidance. The problem: Free-to-play games like “Fortnite” dominate the gaming industry, not $80 console titles. Plus, games like EA’s upcoming “Battlefield 6” are under immense pressure to succeed since they cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. So EA’s switching its focus: Pressing Buttons: The massive buyout of EA could spark investor interest in gaming companies: Shares of EA and other gaming companies, including Take-Two and Roblox, rose yesterday. But the deal has a vital level to complete first: regulatory approval. Regulators may question whether the Saudi fund’s involvement raises national security concerns. EA’s games have a trove of data on American gamers that goes beyond their “Battlefield” kill/death ratios. The Saudi fund has been expanding its gaming interests with sizable stakes in EA and rival gaming company Take-Two Interactive, as well as acquiring the gaming division of Pokémon Go-maker Niantic. Saudi Arabia also hosted the Esports World Cup last year. Lame duck Disney CEO Bob Iger will likely have his hands full with pressure from regulators and investors in his remaining days on the job. Tying its various advertising tech services together has allowed Google to snare roughly 20% of each dollar that moves through its platforms. Lachlan Murdoch’s moves so far are clearly those of someone who came of age during an era of rapidly advancing digitization. Whether it pursues the box office or not, Netflix is clearly interested in catering to the extroverts among us. ESPN’s standalone streaming service is finally here, but it’s core audience may have already found a preferred way to watch sports. Advertising companies are scrambling to make changes as their businesses get hammered by advances in artificial intelligence. Vegas has been dealing with the economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration’s trade, tariff and immigration policies. Revenue from theme parks in the US rose 10% to $6.4 billion, with passenger cruises and resort stays registering higher turnout. Warner Bros. Discovery entered the year stuck in media conglomerate mud, with its eponymous film studio in especially bad shape. The new guardrails may help the platform stay one step ahead of a growing crop of age verification laws cropping up across the country. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Meta CMO says there are 3 things that will determine whether AI causes companies to grow or shrink head count

Every time Henry publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Artificial intelligence will likely destroy some jobs — and create some new ones. Whether that nets out to a head count reduction or an increase at any given company ultimately boils down to a few factors, Meta's CMO says. Alex Schultz has worked at Meta for almost two decades, starting at Facebook as an analyst and working his way up to chief marketing officer. The company has undergone significant changes over the years, from a pandemic-era hiring boom to layoffs during Mark Zuckerberg's "year of efficiency" and, most recently, a costly AI poaching spree. On "The A16z Podcast," Schultz said that there were three factors determining whether AI would cause companies to grow or shrink their workforce. First, Schultz said that AI would enable workers to perform existing tasks more efficiently — something that could lead to a company's headcount shrinking. "Existing stuff is going to be done more efficiently with AI as it exists today," Schultz said. "A lot of stuff can be automated, a lot of stuff can be done more efficiently. So that work, there will be less of it." There are already signs of that playing out at some major tech giants. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that he expected AI efficiency gains to reduce the company's corporate workforce. These AI efficiency cuts are leading to what some refer to as the "Great Shrinking." On the other side of the equation are work-creating possibilities from AI advancements. Schultz's second factor is the creation of work that was previously unimaginable. "Things that literally weren't possible before will become possible," he said. "That can open up a lot more jobs." Schultz used the example of "semantic understanding of content," which bettered content ranking and could not exist without AI. A handful of previously unheard-of job titles have emerged from the AI boom. AI trainers are earning lucrative contracts, while prompt engineers are discerning the best ways to interact with AI. Some companies are hiring guidance positions to vet AI vendors and explain tools to the workforce. Schultz's third factor surrounds cost-prohibitive work. AI may open up the possibility for these new projects. "Things that were possible, but just were really effing expensive, suddenly become over the threshold of reasonable to do," he said. Schultz uses the example of support chatbots. Before, you could have built a customer support bot, Schultz said, but it was "prohibitively expensive." Now, AI can do it — and people can build the system, creating new work. How it ultimately shakes out at a company comes down to the result of that equation. Will the head count shrinkage from efficiency gains outweigh the growth from new (or newly affordable) work growth? Answering that will determine the labor outcomes, Schultz said. That is, if artificial general intelligence (AGI) doesn't come first, which Schultz said would disrupt the full equation. "It depends how weird you think it's going to get," he said. Jump to

Companies are saying that the economy and AI are causing the large amount of tech layoffs, but Vanessa Wingårdh looked at the H-1B visa data and noticed that the companies are lying. She argues that the American employees are being replaced by cheaper H-1B visa workers. WSJ also reported on this due to some senators speaking up. As proof she uses the H-1B data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. When filtering by fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, the number of Beneficiaries Approved for some of the big corporations as of 30 June 2025 are shown in the second column below. I also searched a bit for news articles about layoffs and put those numbers in the third column. A commenter on Hacker News writes: "You can go on Blind, Fishbowl, any work related subreddit, etc. and hear the same story over and over and over - 'My company replaced half my department with H1Bs or simply moved it to an offshore center in India, and then on the next earnings call announced that they had replaced all those jobs with AI'." I searched a bit to verify these claims and it seems plausible since I could without much effort find a report from Boeing in the 2000s, and that indeed the replacing of US workers by H-1Bs seems commonly agreed upon here, here, and here. Another commenter pointed out that Accenture proposed hiring 12,000 employees in a new campus in India.

Title: The Benefit Of Walmart CEO Doug McMillon’s AI Warning In The Workplace
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2025/09/29/the-benefit-of-walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillons-ai-warning-in-the-workplace/
Time Published: 2025-09-29T23:30:54Z
Full Content:
ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. When Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told conference attendees that “artificial intelligence is going to change literally every job,” remarks later reported by The Wall Street Journal, it was easy to interpret his words as a dire warning. And it is, but hidden in that warning is a benefit CEOs can’t afford to ignore. AI isn’t just another tech wave, as it’s a force already reshaping skills, workflows, cultures, and career paths across industries. The question isn’t whether disruption will hit your company; it’s whether your organization can adapt fast enough to stay relevant and competitive. Much like in health, where stress can either accelerate decline or build strength depending on the quality of preparation, AI presents leaders with the same choice. Viewed reactively, it erodes, but viewed proactively, it strengthens. In an interview with The Associated Press, McMillon stressed that many roles aren’t disappearing. Instead, they’re being “plussed up.” Rather than imagining a hollowed-out workforce, leaders can see AI as an amplifier that reshapes jobs rather than eliminates them. This reframing is significant as it shifts the narrative from one of scarcity to one of abundance. If jobs evolve instead of disappear, organizations gain the opportunity to redesign how work is done, how employees develop, and how performance is evaluated. It mirrors what happens in health and performance: stressors are neutral. A workout can build strength or cause injury, depending on proper preparation and a solid initial foundation. Likewise, AI can either expand opportunities or create obsolescence, depending on whether leaders build organizations resilient enough to adapt. McMillon’s warning is ultimately a reminder that organizational relevance in the AI era depends on three traits: skill diversification, adaptability, and continuous learning. They are the workplace equivalents of oxygen, metabolism, and muscle growth. And together, they protect an organization’s most valuable currency: its people. A diverse nutritional palate strengthens your body, and diverse skills strengthen your workplace. Walmart has leaned into skills-based training, even offering truck drivers advanced technical courses to ensure roles evolve rather than disappear. The same pattern is happening everywhere. According to LinkedIn’s 2025 Guide to Future-Proofing Your Career, 85% of U.S. professionals could see at least a quarter of their skills reshaped by AI. Organizations that cling to static job descriptions, credential-based hiring, and outdated cultural norms risk fragility. Those who build broad skill ecosystems create antifragility and ultimately stand out in the market. In biology, metabolism determines whether stress fuels growth or decline. In organizations, adaptability plays the same role. McMillon’s framing of jobs as “plussed up” depicts how disruption can be reframed as evolution. Instead of defaulting to mass layoffs, an adaptable organization can redesign workflows that complement human judgment, creativity, empathy, and other unique human traits with AI’s speed and scale. These companies can thus further improve their performance while also attracting top talent. Humans extend their healthspan and lifespan through lifelong learning, which involves exercising their muscles, training their brains, and refining habits over the course of decades. Organizations extend their relevance in the same way. LinkedIn data reveals AI literacy has grown 100% year-over-year, with certifications and retraining surging among other developments. Continuous learning is no longer optional; it’s an essential compounding mechanism for corporate survival. Companies that fail to embed it into their organizational DNA risk stagnant performance and losing top talent to competitors who prioritize growth. McMillon isn’t alone. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have echoed similar views: AI will stress every workplace system. But stress itself is neutral, as the outcome depends on whether CEOs have built the infrastructure to turn it into growth. Just as individuals extend their healthspan by investing in habits that pay dividends over time, leaders must extend their organization’s relevance by treating skills, adaptability, and learning as core assets. Doug McMillon’s warning is worth heeding not because it signals an end, but because it offers a blueprint for the evolution required in the next era of business.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. In May, DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model on the developer platform Hugging Face. DeepSeek unveiled a new experimental model called V3.2-exp in September, designed to have dramatically lower inference costs when used in long-context operations. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

Following the first launch agreement announced in June 2024, this second multi-launch contract within 18 months further solidifies Electron’s international expansion and leadership of the small lift launch market globally. This latest contract secures the launch of 21 StriX SAR satellites across multiple missions through to the end of the decade. Rocket Lab has been Synspective’s sole launch provider to-date, successfully deploying six StriX satellites across six dedicated launches from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The next 21 Synspective launches will take place from the same launch site, with Rocket Lab’s schedule flexibility, tailored launch service, and streamlined operations central to Synspective’s decision to extend its previous multi-launch contract. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Regular and reliable launch on a flexible schedule is essential to the build out of Synspective’s constellation, and Electron has been integral to this from the start as the sole launcher of all StriX satellites in space today. It’s an honor to add another 10 StriX satellites to Electron’s launch manifest and continue our long-standing partnership with Synspective.” Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, said: “Rocket Lab’s precision and track record have consistently enabled us to stay on schedule and achieve our mission objectives. As we move forward with 21 launches, our continued collaboration is crucial to accelerating the deployment of our SAR satellites and the growth of our data platform.” Electron’s reliability, proficiency at executing against rapid timelines, and satellite deployment accuracy to within meters of its target, has made it the commercial launch vehicle of choice for satellite operators wanting to build out their constellations with precision. The majority of Electron launches this year have either been the continuation of multi-launch contracts with commercial constellation customers, or have completed the entire deployment of a constellation in less than a year.

On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Time Published: 2025-09-29T19:18:31Z
Full Content:
Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. Just as Open AI CEO Sam Altman and Meta leader Mark Zuckerberg begin acknowledging that there may be truth to the warnings of an AI bubble, Jensen Huang is doubling down on his bullishness. In a recent podcast appearance with Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner, the Nvidia CEO brushed aside the growing caution and instead zeroed in on the company he sees as the next dominant force: OpenAI. “OpenAI is very likely going to be the world’s next multitrillion-dollar hyperscale company,” Huang said. That bold prediction comes at a moment when even AI’s loudest evangelists are warning of overvaluation and overbuilding. Altman himself has cautioned that too much money is flooding into unproven AI ventures, while Zuckerberg has compared today’s infrastructure frenzy to past bubbles. Yet Huang insists the skeptics are missing the deeper forces reshaping the economy. In his telling, the story comes down to basic physics, not hype.“General-purpose computing is over,” Huang said, describing what he sees as a generational shift in how all industries will run. “The future is accelerated computing and AI.” He outlined what he calls the “three scaling laws” of AI—pretraining, post-training, and inference—each of which exponentially increases demand for compute. While training workloads have already been well-documented, Huang stressed that inference—the real-time reasoning that underpins everything from chatbots to recommendation algorithms—is only just beginning. “The longer you think, the better the answer you get—and thinking requires more compute,” he explained. That framing matters because inference is where AI collides with day-to-day usage. Training runs happen in bursts, but inference happens constantly: Every chatbot prompt, every AI video render, every background algorithmic tweak consumes processing power. If Huang is right, that relentless demand means AI won’t follow the boom-and-bust cycles of earlier technologies but will instead drive a compounding need, one that will also boost Nvidia. Huang’s comments came just days after Nvidia announced its most audacious deal yet: a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help fund the company’s massive data center build-out. It’s the largest example of what analysts call Nvidia’s “circular financing” strategy, in which it invests in, or lends to, customers who in turn spend billions on Nvidia’s GPUs. To Huang, it’s a smart way to align incentives with a once-in-a-generation partner scaling faster than any company in history. “If that’s the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there is one of the smartest investments we can imagine,” he said. But to markets, the sheer size of the commitment was jarring. Deutsche Bank had previously warned that 2025 could be remembered as “the summer AI turned ugly,” pointing to the risk that circular revenue-recognition games could inflate demand. Deutsche Bank analysts said Nvidia’s way of helping fund its own customers reminds them of past bubbles, when companies juiced sales by essentially paying buyers to buy their products.They warned that even if these deals are only a small slice of revenue right now, Nvidia is so big that any slipup could shake the whole stock market. As they put it, the stock is “priced for perfection,” which means there’s not much room for mistakes if AI growth cools off. That tension helps explain why Altman, despite running Nvidia’s most important customer, has been publicly warning of “a frenzy of cash chasing anything labeled AI.” And Zuckerberg, while still pouring billions into Meta’s own AI ambitions, has likewise admitted the infrastructure build-out carries “bubble-like” characteristics reminiscent of railroads and the dotcom era. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has taken note, pointing to the “unusually large amounts of economic activity” flowing into AI, a rare signal that the froth is on the Fed’s radar. Huang remains unmoved. To him, these warnings miss the forest for the trees. He insists that Nvidia and OpenAI’s growth is propelled by scaling laws and performance per watt—fundamentals that make his company the only rational choice for hyperscalers. “This is the industrial revolution,” he told Gurley and Gerstner, a common refrain from Huang on the subject of AI. Huang also seemed to flip his stance on President Donald Trump’s recent $100,000 H-1B visa fee. He called the policy “a great start” for cracking down on visa abuse and illegal immigration, but cautioned that the steep price tag “probably sets the bar a little too high.” For Huang, himself an immigrant, Trump’s fee may be a useful first step, but only if it’s paired with broader reforms that keep America attractive to top talent. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Economic uncertainty lingers at the edge of markets, but it hasn't done much to dent the wild enthusiasm for AI in 2025. The frenzy is still mainly seen in the market's biggest stocks. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 40% in six months, compared to a gain of 20% for the S&P 500 in that time. However, the rally is broadening, and other winners are emerging as the AI buildout accelerates. Analysts at Futurum Group, a market research and intelligence firm, flagged a list of stocks they see as most likely to outperform the most popular names in the next chapter of the AI boom. Here are five tech stocks it sees as the big winners as the rally extends beyond the Magnificent Seven. Ticker: AVGO Year-to-date gain: 43% Analyst's view: Futurum analysts describe Broadcom as the "Uncle Sam of AI," due to its ability to tax many aspects of AI inference, earning it the No. 1 spot on its ranking. "In a world where every AI token costs someone money, Broadcom isn't just supplying parts, but they are becoming the toll collector across silicon, networking, and software, taking a cut from every layer of the stack." Ticker: PLTR Year-to-date gain: 137% Analyst's view: While Palantir stock has stumbled in recent weeks, leading to a spike in bearish sentiment, Futurum's analysts aren't worried. "Palantir has emerged as the execution layer of AI, not selling models or dashboards but decision engines that fuse data, policy, and action across government, defense, and enterprise." Ticker: ORCL Year-to-date gain: 70% Analyst's view: One of the season's breakout tech stocks, Oracle has been in focus since a bullish revenue forecast sent shares surging. Futurum sees it as the core player in the industry, praising its strength as a fundamental enterprise AI provider. "Where others rent compute, Oracle ties it to data by being that structural edge as AI moves from prototype to production," the report said. "That edge is now scaled by numbers that rival hyperscalers." Ticker: NBIS Year-to-date gain: 295% Analyst's view: An unknown AI utility company until recently, Nebius stock surged on September 9 on news that it had inked a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, and Futurum sees the Netherlands-based company playing a pivotal role in the AI economy. "Nebius isn't competing with hyperscalers on breadth. It's competing on the physical and economic constraints that define AI compute: power, cooling, and integration." Ticker: MBD Year-to-date gain: 31% Analyst's view: Over the past two quarters, MongoDB stock has surged as Atlas, its enterprise platform, has helped drive significant revenue growth. Futurum highlighted the platform's ability to help large-scale companies simplify AI applications. "That evolution is why Mongo is winning critical workloads and why it's becoming the memory layer of AI, the bridge between messy enterprise data and agentic systems that require structured retrieval."

Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal, Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our new Coffee Break/Sunday Movie features The western powers seem to be making competing desperate bids to maintain narrative control, and it is very hard to parse the difference between deliberate deception, delusion, and what is just plain dipshittery. I’ll talk about Europe and the Trump’s administration’s efforts in future posts, but this post will look at Israel’s efforts on what Alistair Crooke calls their “8th front:” their battle to control the narrative in the United States. Crooke also insists they are losing in that battle. The Times of Israel agrees. Also a note re the sourcing and quotes in this post. The narrative is being contested online. It’s been my practice to use X.com (formerly Twitter) and YouTube to monitor other social media such as Instagram, TikTok, Telegram, Twitch, etc. Much of this story is being contested on Twitter so this post features a higher than usual % of Twitter embeds, apologies if that’s inconvenient for you. If you’d like me to quote from the tweets separately please let me know in the comments. I’m also embedding tweets from a variety of sources, embeds are not endorsements. Some of these accounts are anonymous and none of them (or any source) should ever be trusted implicitly, nor are they necessarily “allies” of this community (if there is such a thing). I’ve tried to select relevant sources and well-documented posts that advance the story I’m trying to tell. Israel’s desperate push to maintain narrative control in the U.S. Many are, including the President of Iran, anticipating a renewed Israeli attack on Iran and support for Israel plummeting in the U.S., especially among Democrats and young people, including young Republicans. Understandably, these two factors have Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu ramping up his efforts to control the narrative in America. Tucker Carlson went on Glenn Greenwald’s Rumble channel and claimed that Netanyahu is “going around the Middle East” and bragging that he controls the U.S. and Donald Trump. This is not the behavior of a secure player, confident in his powers. This is the voice of dangerous desperation, delusion and maybe some dipshittery too. JUST IN: Tucker Carlson says he knows for 100% FACT that Netanyahu is telling people in the Middle East: “I CONTROL the United States, and I CONTROL Donald Trump” pic.twitter.com/VIBhir6XTE — Sulaiman Ahmed (@ShaykhSulaiman_) September 25, 2025 Bibi’s has also been meeting with influencers and bragging openly about Israel’s control of TikTok (via the Oracle acquisition) and X.com. I’ll quote the Aaron Mate tweet that he used to introduce the below: “Liberals and many progressives spent years fixated on mythical Russian oligarchs controlling US democracy and equally mythical “Russian interference” flooding our information system. “All along, the actual foreign interference was right in front of their dupe faces:” Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu briefed American influencers on TikTok, calling it the “most important” weapon in securing support for Israel on the right-wing. He went on to say, “Weapons change over time… the most important ones are the social media,” and, “the most important… pic.twitter.com/0gfX9Hikzj — AF Post (@AFpost) September 27, 2025 Influencer Dipshittery While not as important as the TikTok deal, Netanyahu has also embarked on an “influencer-heavy” approach to influencing young American public opinion. Not only do social media influences reach a multiple of Americans under 35 than that reached by the MSM, influencers are also often ignorant of politics and sometimes utterly amoral and therefore happy to sign up to support genocide. Bibi recently hosted a number of American influencers. The Prime Minister of Israel official X account tweeted Bibi’s trophy shots from the meeting: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met, after his UN General Assembly speech, with pro-Israel influencers and spoke with them about the challenges in the new era, and the public diplomacy efforts and the influence of the social networks on the discourse for and against Israel. pic.twitter.com/SX397fx7hn — Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) September 28, 2025 Naturally online critics of Israel were quick to document which influencers Bibi got to, here’s one effort by a right-wing X user (the thread on X includes later additions): REVEALED: Netanyahu's Private Meeting of Influencers at the israeli Embassy to help "take over Tiktok and Twitter" ▪️Yair Netanyahu▪️Emily Austin ▪️Debra Lea Schwartzben ▪️judeanceo: Shay Szabo▪️Lizzy Savetsky▪️ThatZionistGirl: _thatopinionatedgirl_ (name unknown)… pic.twitter.com/pWOznACDpn — Sam Parker 🇺🇸🧯 (@BasedSamParker) September 27, 2025 Some of these people are real gems: Emily Wilson aka Emily Saves America attended the secret Hamptons influencer summit with Bill Ackman, and was then flown off to Israel for a propaganda tour Before Israel recruited her, she declared support for Alabama re-instituting chattel slavery pic.twitter.com/Q5fGA5UBiR — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 Different Emily but this one got right to work cranking out real cringe on behalf of Bibi, she’s also hooked up with Hollywood agents: Emily Austin is represented by Casey Wasserman, a top pro-Israel fundraiser for the Democratic Party https://t.co/BxSd6L4GhW — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 We’ll have more from Max on Israel’s Hollywood moves further down in the post.

Let’s not forget that Netanyahu was one of the first to post about the death of Kirk, with a very polished tweet, written on a day when Israel was engaged in military attacks on seven neighbors. Charlie Kirk was murdered for speaking truth and defending freedom. A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization. I spoke to him only two weeks ago and invited him to Israel. Sadly, that visit will not take place.We lost an… — Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) September 10, 2025 He’s since gone on to deny that Israel had any role in Kirk’s death: Charlie Kirk was a great man. He deserves honor – not lies. pic.twitter.com/NwEN4B2q7w — Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) September 18, 2025 The massively popular libertarian comic Tim Dillon discussed Bibi’s denials with Max Blumenthal: Tim Dillon: "Can you remember any time in the history of a political assassination the leader of a foreign government has come out to deny that they were behind it?" Max Blumenthal: "No. And I've never seen anything like what Netanyahu was doing after a tragedy…since 9/11." pic.twitter.com/fgdKyyldIt — James Li (@5149jamesli) September 14, 2025 Ben Shapiro is running the show at TPUSA. He was quick to announce it, in terms of “picking up the blood-stained mic”, posting on September 11, the day after Kirk’s death. A post shared by Ben Shapiro (@officialbenshapiro) He’s been accused of buying that controlling role at the organization, a move that was sewed up by September 15. Ben Shapiro’s donation of $1M is why they kiIIed Charlie. Now TPUSA remains Zionist. Charlie was AGAINST war with Iran. Ben supports it. You can bet TPUSA will now push for a war with Iran. Ben is a Mossad parasite. This is a hostile takeover. pic.twitter.com/Dm2HntzGtZ — ADAM (@AdameMedia) September 17, 2025 Given that Shapiro’s Daily Wire has allegedly been declining in viewership (Google trends) since he lost Candace Owens over her opposition to Gaza, but he needs a fresh gentile face to be a credible frontman for the young MAGA crowd: It is abundantly clear that the RNC is enforcing a controlled Charlie Kirk on Turning Point USA.

Republicans proudly stand with Israel and condem this hateful rhetoric. pic.twitter.com/DUxBtk2yj1 — Brilyn Hollyhand (@BrilynHollyhand) April 30, 2024 At the University of Texas we’d describe someone like Hollyhand as “putting off strong Kappa Alpha, Birmingham chapter, vibes.” UPDATE: Hollyhand might be overstating his relationship with TPSUA. Hollywood Hasbara And it’s not just influencers, there is plenty of work to be done on the MSM side and Israel has been busy there, too. Max Blumenthal tweeted a list of “Hollywood hasbara”: The Hollywood hasbara is coming hard and fast as Israel loses control of the narrative A Paramount propaganda series on October 7 A (postponed) AppleTV show glorifying the ADL The new season of AppleTV’s news-focused Morning Show demonizes Iran while ignoring Gaza pic.twitter.com/FYYddwEOGR — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 Paramount is all in, there’s this documentary: pic.twitter.com/o1omvQKu8j — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) September 29, 2025 And a new mini-series on October 7, per The Hollywood Reporter: Paramount+ has released the harrowing first trailer for an upcoming four-part limited series depicting the Oct. 7, 2023 tragedy in Israel. The project is titled Red Alert and it portrays the largest and deadliest massacre in Israel’s history, when more than 1,200 concert-goers, families and individuals near the Gaza border were murdered and 250 were kidnapped by Hamas. The show’s production credits include Pulp Fiction producer Lawrence Bender and Homeland producer Keshet Media Group. Red Alert is “draws from the true experiences of those who survived and weaves their courageous personal stories into a cinematic narrative of the devastating terrorist attack that turned southern Israel into a war zone, testing humanity and forging heroism through chaos.” Kirk’s death has slowed at least one Hollywood hasbara effort, per the New York Times: Apple TV+ has postponed the release of its show “The Savant,” starring Jessica Chastain as an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to stop mass shootings. The show was set to begin streaming its first two episodes on Friday. Apple did not give a reason for its postponement, which it announced on Tuesday, saying in a brief statement only that the decision was made after “careful consideration.” It did not announce a new release date. Two people with knowledge of the discussions said that the company was reluctant to release the show in the current political climate, after the assassination of Charlie Kirk this month. The most important of all: Oracle, Paramount, and TikTok I’ll close with what I opened with, the importance to Netanyahu and Israel of the new TikTok ownership. Israel is currently being blamed for the wave of anti-Chinese propaganda that provided the ostensible reason for last year’s U.S. Congressional vote to ban TikTok unless it changed owners: Did You Know Zionists Were Behind the TikTok CCP Narrative 1) Oct-Dec 2023, TikTok was top app for Israel truth 2) Dec 2023, Zionist tech investor Anthony Goldbloom commissioned NCRI (Israeli funded/managed NGO) to produce a report claiming China’s CCP controls TikTok. After… https://t.co/adlraAQOTA pic.twitter.com/nm41Xm8Wjg — GenXGirl (@GenXGirl1994) September 28, 2025 We also must discuss the role of Larry Ellison, David Ellison and the new Oracle nepo-ownership of Paramount in pulling that off. Wired is quoting “a Trump advisor” who calls Larry Ellison, a “Shadow president”: In an age where human attention is perhaps the world’s most valuable commodity, the Ellisons could be in charge of almost everything a modern-day pseudo robber barron could want by the end of this year or soon after. I spoke with sources who have dealt with Ellison—as well as others who know his son, David—to get a sense of how he operates. And he operates a lot lately… There’s his pending dominance over vertical video with a key role in the proposed new ownership consortium for the US version of TikTok, for which Oracle’s servers already provide hosting. There’s airwave domination, with a news and entertainment behemoth under his son’s control following the merger of David’s Skydance and Paramount—which might possibly include the keys to not only CBS, but also CNN, if Skydance actually puts in a bid and succeeds in a potential acquisition of Warner Brothers-Discovery. The empire spans from the sweaty floor of the octagon after acquiring US broadcast rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (also under Paramount) all the way to the clay soil of Abilene, Texas, home of OpenAI’s Stargate data center project led by Oracle and Softbank. Oracle is also linked to a $100 billion deal with Nvidia and OpenAI announced Monday. The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil. I’ve posted previously about Ellison, Oracle, Paramount, Israel, and the Trump administration. I’ve also previously posted about the role of the Trump administration in pressuring Paramount’s previous owner Shari Redstone to sell to the Ellisons. I’ve also cited the work of The MMA Draw which explained the role of Ellison ally Ari Emanuel in getting Trump to support that move. Emanuel is a top Trump insider, a combat sports multi-monopolist (mixed martial arts, pro wrestling, and moving to take over boxing), Hollywood power broker, and brother of Democratic presidential aspirant Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel is also at the center of a web of financiers that is deeply involved in the new Paramount, per Zach Arnold at The MMA Draw: Ari Emanuel is focused entirely on controlling the politics and the plumbing of media pipes. He has deep ties to ESPN & Netflix. There are still ties with NBCUniversal. And now Paramount is on the table. Since the take-private of Endeavor, Gerry Cardinale of Redbird Capital has emerged as Ari Emanuel’s key financial muscle. Redbird Capital is a principle investor in Skydance, the Larry & David Ellison shop that is taking over Paramount from Shari Redstone. Guess who is now going to be running management in Paramount? Guess who’s going to be on Paramount’s Board of Directors? Andy Gordon, former heavyweight from Goldman Sachs, is now COO and Chief Strategist (Redbird) at Paramount. Justin Hamill, Chief Legal Officer of Silver Lake, is going to be on Paramount’s BOD. Silver Lake and Mubadala are the main financiers behind Endeavor. Heads, Ari wins; tails, you lose. That’s how this works. Mubadala is the UAE’s financial vehicle and Silver Lake (which owns most of WME Group, the parent company of Emanuel’s fight empire TKO) is reportedly to be Oracle’s new partner in the TikTok acquisition: A group of three investors, including Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake, will take a roughly 50% stake in TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the deal said on Thursday. A group of existing shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, will hold a roughly 30% stake, the source said. Among ByteDance’s current investors are Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR. … CNBC reported earlier that Abu Dhabi-based MGX, Oracle and Silver Lake are poised to be the main investors in TikTok U.S. with a combined 45% ownership, citing sources. MGX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the CNBC report. MGX is an artificial intelligence investment firm and a partner of Silver Lake, and falls under the purview of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser and brother of the President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The AI and surveillance delusions of Larry Ellison It’s fairly well established that Israeli PM Netanyahu is delusional on many topics whether it’s Israel’s status as a world power, Israel’s ability to cut off trade with Egypt, or his vision of Israel as a autarkic “Super-Sparta.” I do want to highlight the fundamental desperation that is driving Netanyahu, as Imran Khalid ably described in May: By now, it should surprise no one that Benjamin Netanyahu prefers the echo chamber of his own making to the international chorus demanding accountability. The Israeli prime minister, clinging to office as tenaciously as he clings to delusion, has managed to place himself among the most cynically manipulative leaders of our time, a man who governs not by vision, but by vindictiveness. Once vaunted as a statesman in the mold of Churchill, Netanyahu now more closely resembles a bunker-dwelling autocrat, lashing out at allies and adversaries alike as his credibility collapses under the weight of his own contradictions. … Netanyahu thrives in crisis, not to resolve it but to prolong it, using chaos as a shield against the ever-looming specter of his own political demise. With corruption charges still dogging him and public opinion slipping, he has fashioned Gaza into both a battlefield and a diversion. … He is a leader in free fall, dragging his country with him, increasingly abandoned by allies, and yet still believing himself the indispensable man. The tragedy is not only his. It belongs to Israel—and to all those, Palestinian and Israeli alike, who must live with the consequences of his delusions. But I’d rather focus on some of the delusions and desperation that may be driving Larry Ellison. First, he’s becoming quite well known as one of the leading spokesmen (alongside Palantir’s Alex Karp and Peter Thiel) for a vision of security through surveillance: The man behind the digital ID push is Larry Ellison, owner of Oracle, CBS, CNN, and, soon, TikTok. He wants data centralization and total surveillance. "Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly watching & recording everything that's going on." Terrifying. https://t.co/mb05XvnOAx pic.twitter.com/cUx45ORy2F — Michael Shellenberger (@shellenberger) September 27, 2025 The above may be deception rather than delusion, but if so, Ellison is revealing a great deal about himself to the public and its being widely used against him and his allies (I’ll discuss the backlash to Oracle’s role in the UK’s just announced Digital ID plan in my next post tomorrow morning). As for the desperation, well Oracle is taking out billions of dollars in debt to pay for their AI aspirations, per Yahoo Finance on Sept. 24: Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion US investment-grade bonds on Wednesday, the market’s second-largest deal this year, as the software maker ramps up its spending to meet the needs of the artificial intelligence boom. Demand peaked at nearly $88 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The technology giant — which has nearly doubled in value this year — is issuing debt in six parts, including a rare 40-year bond, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private details. That note will yield 1.37 percentage points above similarly dated Treasuries, compared with initial price talk of about 1.65 percentage points. A floating-rate tranche was dropped during syndication. The debt raise comes as Oracle begins to fulfill massive cloud infrastructure deals with customers like OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc., which are boosting the company’s expenses. Over the next several years, it is projected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rent and power data centers. It is also the cloud provider to TikTok in the US, and under a new framework outlined by the White House earlier this week, it would help oversee the development of a new US-only version of the social media giant’s algorithm. The software company spent years trailing the top three vendors — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — in the competitive cloud infrastructure market. Now that it has struck serious cloud deals, it’s on the hook for upfront costs. Oracle’s cash flow flipped negative this year for the first time since 1992. Analysts anticipate the metric will be in free fall over the coming years before returning to positive in 2029. Oracle and OpenAI announced a $300 billion cloud deal on September 10 (that was truly a historic day) that initially goosed Oracle’s stock price significantly. The Wall Street Journal had the scoop: OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years, people familiar with the matter said, a massive commitment that far outstrips the startup’s current revenue. The deal is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, reflecting how spending on AI data centers is hitting new highs despite mounting concerns over a potential bubble. The Oracle contract will require 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, roughly comparable to the electricity produced by more than two Hoover Dams or the amount consumed by about four million homes. Oracle shares surged by as much as 43% on Wednesday after the cloud company revealed it added $317 billion in future contract revenue during its latest quarter that ended in Aug. 31. Chief Executive Safra Catz told analysts that it had signed contracts with three different customers during the quarter. The share price surge increased Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison’s wealth by more than $100 billion, pushing him into the range of Elon Musk as the world’s richest person, with a net worth of almost $400 billion. The OpenAI and Oracle contract, which starts in 2027, is a risky gamble for both companies. OpenAI is a money-losing startup that disclosed in June it was generating roughly $10 billion in annual revenue—less than one-fifth of the $60 billion it will have to pay on average every year. Oracle is concentrating a large chunk of its future revenue on one customer—and will likely have to take on debt to buy the AI chips needed to power the data centers. Ed Zitron ripped the deal, calling it “full of crap”: Analysts fawned over Oracle — again, as it missed estimates — with TD Cowen’s Derrick Wood saying it was a “momentous quarter” (again, it missed) and that these numbers were “really amazing to see,” and Guggenheim Securities’ John DiFucci said he was “blown away.” Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick added that “[analysts] were all kind of in shock, in a very good way.” RPOs, while standard (and required) accounting practice and based on actual signed contracts, are being used by Oracle as a form of marketing. Plans change, contracts can be canceled (usually with a kill fee, but nevertheless), and, especially in this case, clients can either not have the money to pay or die for the very same reason they can’t pay. In Oracle’s case, it isn’t simply promising ridiculous growth, it is effectively saying it’ll become the dominant player in all cloud compute. Oracle claims that it will make $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in FY2026, $32 billion in FY2027, $73 billion in FY2028, $114 billion in FY2029, and $144 billion in FY2030. While all of this isn’t necessarily OpenAI (as it adds up to $381 billion), it’s fair to assume that the majority of it is. This means — as the $300 billion of the $317 billion of new contracts added by Oracle, and assuming OpenAI makes up 78% of its cloud infrastructure revenue ($300 billion out of $381 billion) — that OpenAI intends to spend over $88 billion fucking dollars in compute by FY2029, and $110 billion dollars in compute, AKA nearly as much as Amazon Web Services makes in a year, in FY2030. Now that stock price froth is beginning to fade with a 16% drop in Oracle’s share price last week, per Technobezz: Sometimes the market’s most beloved darlings get hit the hardest when reality comes knocking. Oracle just learned this lesson the hard way, watching its stock price plummet 16% from recent highs as analysts started asking uncomfortable questions about those sky-high AI promises. The damage started this week when Rothschild & Redburn analyst Alex Haissl dropped a bombshell coverage initiation, slapping Oracle with a rare “Sell” rating and a $175 price target. That’s not just pessimistic – it’s predicting roughly 40% downside from current levels. According to The Motley Fool, shares that were trading above $308 just days ago have already tumbled to around $291, and according to multiple analyst reports, this might just be the beginning. Here’s what’s got Wall Street spooked: Oracle has floated aggressive targets for cloud growth, with executives outlining a path for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to reach about $18 billion this fiscal year and scale toward $144 billion by fiscal 2030. That’s ambitious against the company’s most recent quarter showing total revenue of $15.9 billion and cloud services and license support of $11.7 billion. The numbers tell a more nuanced story than Oracle’s executives might prefer. While the company did post respectable 11% revenue growth in Q4, with cloud services jumping 14% to $11.7 billion, the valuation has gotten completely divorced from fundamentals. According to Seeking Alpha analysts, Oracle now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 41-46 – compare that to the industry median of 29, or even Nvidia’s 50 (despite Nvidia’s 50%+ revenue growth rate). That disconnect becomes even more stark when you consider the broader context. A recent MIT study found that 95% of companies investing in generative AI have yet to see any financial returns. Yet Oracle’s stock had been riding high on promises of triple-digit growth in its multicloud revenue, with CEO Larry Ellison boasting about building 47 new data centers in the next 12 months. The confluence of the AI bubble, the rot economy, what I’ve called “The Interregnum of Unreality” with Israel’s desperate, deceptive, delusional attempts to control the American political system shows how the polycrisis impacts everyone. I’d like to justify my focus on Larry Ellison’s role in this process by referencing an insight from a DropSite News writer Waqas on X who was discussing the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Israel, but I think it’s apropos for Ellison as well: Epstein himself was a supranational entity floating above it all with access to networks and finance that is impossible to put together by a single individual. If you consider Israel a proper country and a nation, you would fall into the trap of thinking that Epstein worked for Mossad, working for the interests of Israel. But consider this for a second and redo your calculations just to see if it makes sense: Israel is not a regular country, it is an entity that exists to provide sovereign cover to a network of billionaires and allows them a financial and regulatory home base that can circumvent international laws and local laws in other countries. Even ordinary Israeli citizens are victims of and are being used by this entity. In this system, Epstein is a part of a network that all these people named in the emails are also a part of. They make international deals on behalf of each other and share resources. Israel is a sub structure that allows all this. Mossad then is just an intelligence arm of this loose confederation of billionaires. I’ll continue this mini-series tomorrow morning with a look at the delusion, deception and dipshittery involved with the information war being fought by the EU, the UK, and Ukraine to control the European population and keep the US deeply involved on their increasingly irrelevant subcontinent. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Anecdata to your last point, Nat: a good decade ago my silly sister invested in a scam spun out of illegal sports betting websites on Cyprus that evolved into stock price-calling on a daily-weekly-whatever basis, where you guess if a price would go up or down, period, called binary options trading. This industry became somewhat regulated on Cyprus, so it moved to Israel, where its practices were spread around the world by immigrants who spoke no Hebrew, but knew how to sell bubbles and BS back home. Tel Aviv was the capital of this industry, and its only regulation was that it was illegal for salesmen to sell to Israelis. That’s it. As long as the calls were international, no regs. It’s a cute, minor example of the service system DropSite describes. I guess it’s true, it sure worked on my sister (who’d dragged me in too because I wanted to show my love . . .) Yes, we lost everything, then our salesman ‘died.’ I’d like to think that judging by their crappy accounting software, Oracle won’t be a dominant player in anything. But that software enjoys a 5-10% market share in its industry and I know of at least one company that gladly overpaid millions of dollars to install it. Are Tiktok watchers savvier than CEOs and will they know crap when they see it, and tune out? A guy can dream. On a somewhat positive note, now that Ellison has swallowed up CNN, it might be a little easier to convince a few holdouts I know that CNN is in fact a propaganda network, and not a middle of the road independent news source. Obviously not shown in any of these (esp not propaganda flicks/stuff coming out of Hollywood thst is): IDF gunships massacring more Jews than ever around 10/7 since SS was still active… I’m not trying to be negative, but does this seem like a very weird and out-of-character piece for NC? Maybe it’s just me. Sorry you feel that way. It was an attempt to build on my piece on the online aftermath of the Charlie Kirk killing: Doomscrolling the Influencer Apocalypse which was quite well received by the commenters and my colleagues here. How many are noticing and decrying the whole narrative thing? Wasn’t bad enough with US media cheerleading lying BS nonsense? Now international clapp-trap apps by more wannabe self-promoting Platonic Manipulation Class best and brightest to tell us paroles, plebes and unwashed what to think. Any wonder about disillusionment, and desire for change? Eff’em all, and the narratives they rode in on. Say, Waaaa? A worthy addition to NC Keep up the fine work, Nat: this long-time NC-er appreciates it muchly. Reporting of this quality, with background and deeper context for news worthy events of the day, served with links to evidence of skulduggery in plain sight and further links to other useful reporting…. Although does Ben Shapiro have a millions bucks of his own money with no string attached? It should be presumed Ben would be acting as a bagman for various billionaires This is a “yellow waders” (nee Lambert) style write up … and I love it. Perhaps the only difference is the emphasis of content from X, which Nat did call out. People who’ve been paying attention should understand that what’s playing out online is a major reason for concern among the consent manufacturers. Wake up. Less and less people are glued to boob tube … Exhibit A: MSNBC, CNN & Fox News Ratings: Dramatic Drops & Most-Watched Shows (via TVInsider) Excerpts (key 25 – 54 demographic #’s): • Fox News was down 30% in total viewers and 48% in the key demo • MSNBC down 26% and in the [key] demo, down 37% • CNN down 29% and in the key [demo] down 44% Online is where the (increasingly anti-war, pro-Palestine) discourse is getting amplified. This is why TikTok was made to surrender to American (and by extension Ni0n1sT) control. This is probably why EA just went private. Young people are abandoning support for Israel and this is a threat to the horrid, inhumane, warmongering status quo. Yes, it feels like a clear spiritual successor to those for me: here is a thing that I don’t understand/isn’t receiving sufficient coverage/is at odds with what’s being reported in the media/etc., here’s my attempt to dig into it and figure it out, commenter input/participation welcome. In this case it’s the rabbit hole of social media influencers and how they shape narratives around current events, which I freely admit is something I understand not at all, so I welcome the attempt. There’s definitely something pathological out there, probably multiple somethings, and I think some diagnostic efforts are warranted. (I guess the Chris faction is in support based on a sample of 2) Thank you dear Chris Of The Pacific … Now we wait for the other five or six Chris’s to complete the sample size … 😂 I think this piece is great, and fits totally with NC. It covers geopolitics, economics and the attention economy/firehose of social media. It also goes it together in a very important way – the Ellisons, the Hobbit-botherers, real misinformation, and the surveillance state. This is a hugely important and new confluence of power and I for one think it’s something we should be focusing on. As Chris says above, Yellow Waders stuff :) I am reminded of what the great western sheriff and journalist Bat Masterson said, ” Everybody gets plenty of ice. The difference is that the Rich get it in the summertime, and the Poor get it in the winter.” This was, among other things, a description post on a part of the influencer world. Go back and do a scroll watching all those selfies, most of them trying to look happy and sure, and a few serious and sure. Truth in a selfie is what the influencers sell. It is precisely each of those selfies, secure, happy, full-screen faces the main and only source for trust in each influencer and whatever they say. IMO, this show is, by itself, interesting. Then go and check cui bono in the same post. I really have no idea on how influencing are these influencers but this is a relatively new and weird way to push and invest on whatever campaign. For me, this is the very first example of a “geostrategic influencer campaign”. The dots are getting closer, not much skill needed to connect them anymore. Ellison and the rest of the Zio-garchy fidn to be trillionaires soon, as all the wealth and resources are asset-stripped and sucked up by the Giant Vampire Squid. (to bring back the metaphor). As the electromagnetic spectrum is increasingly monopolized, the more they can completely dictate most public discourse. And the cycle continues…. but on the bright side, it seems like more and more are starting to question, as the lies get more and more irrational and transparent. (I’m trying to be optimistic for a change) Thanks to places like NC, we can read and discuss matters that are outside of the Unified Hegemonic Narrative, which is becoming more and more difficult. George Galloway was detained and harassed by armed police at Gatwick Airport recently. His personal electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for hours. And dude was an MP for decades, and is now a media personality as well. BTW, Alastair Crooke is spelled with an “e” at the end. Long LIve Naked Capitalism! Thanks very much, and I fixed the spelling of Crooke, d’oh! Silver Lake + the Saudis + Jared Kushner announced today that they are buying Electronic Arts, the world’s largest (not connected to a platform) video game publisher. Ah I was tempted to fit that in. That’s a deal that really makes explicit the alliance between the Zionist money and the Gulf State Arabs. Abraham Accords may be dead but long live the Abraham Accords, amirite? W.T.A.F. There’s been a recent groundswell about banning Israel from international sports … I am wondering how this plays into it. They are determined to have some method of tapping into youth to keep spreading #N1Oni5T propaganda and lies … Ugh I do fear that this will culminate in a real wide spread antisemitism as I think theres plenty to show that there for many, there is little distinction between a Zionist and a Jew (buffered by how Israel wraps itself in the Jewish idenity) What’s worse, these psychos are more than happy with it because it then supports their position that the only safe place for Jewish people is Israel. This is becoming far more grim than I could have ever imagined. Last time you posted “Doomscrolling … “, I promised to return to comment in depth, but never did … #Boo But today … I avenge my master! LOL (via screenrant.com) #NarrativeControl I always fondly recall how MSM heads exploded after Bernie won Nevada in 2020 Dem Primary. That was a good example of what happens when establishment consent manufacturing doesn’t work. The stakes are much higher here, however, hence the incredibly desperate moves. But you can tell it’s a bunch old old heads (Boooooooomeeeeerrrs) running the show. What makes them think that the kids making tik-toks about #th3G4z@g3N0c1d3 won’t move elsewhere to some other platform if there is some kind of clamp down? Remember all the Americans who rushed to RedNote earlier this year (via Reuters)? What would the US do to stop that? The only forcing function for obedience is the fact that a lot of creators make good $ on TikTok. Not sure how many of those posting radical dissent need to stay on that gravy train. … which is a perfect segue to Influencer Dipshittery. #InfluencerDipshittery > … influencers are also often ignorant of politics and sometimes utterly amoral and therefore happy to sign up to support genocide Pretty much. Thanks for the tweets. They often serve as portals, not ends in and of themselves. One need only follow them via the comments and replies to realize again that this is not a one way street. Those hoping to keep g3n0C16e alive are seriously underestimating the severity of the schisms on both sides of the political divide, and the degree of clapback incoming. I was curious to follow up on one Destiny Albritton – it’s always somewhat bizarre to see African American or other people in the African diaspora caping for Ni0n15ts. What on earth are they thinking? Her last repost is of another African American influencer, Xaviaer DuRousseau, posting a seven-point-litany of excuses talking points regarding the now confirmed and infamous Hamptons influencer gathering hosted by Bill Ackman. One can almost feel the beads of perspiration on this brother’s forehead … LOL • He repeats the talking point Netenyahu tried to sell the world in the first tweet after the shooting – that Charlie was a friend of Israel. That’s not untrue, but why is everyone keen to say it if it were not in question? • He tries to explain away being nervy when approached by Max Blumenthal – I was drunk. I never heard of you or your site. See Nat’s quote above re: ignorant. • He claims Charlie designed the event, and one of the topics covered was right-wing infighting … funny that. When I followed the rabbit hole to DuRousseau’s X profile, I saw plenty evidence of that: beefing with Tim Pool? Check! Getting called out by mostly right-wing accounts for shilling for Bibi? Check! So you see, their dipshittery is getting a fair amount of blowback, and that’s the main thing I take away: that we’re seeing a schism in real time, and I don’t think that genie is getting shoved back in the bottle. And buying TikTok or hiring a bunch of amoral influencers to sh**post Bibi’s way out of his murderous overreach is not going to work. #HollywoodHasbara I’ve always felt that there was a certain fearlessness or perhaps, audacity is a better term, when it comes to Hollywood feeling free to push establishment and anti-establishment narratives. October 7th documentaries are all well and good, but remember, you’re dealing with a generation that’s been fed movies like the entire Bourne series, in which the US Spook estate is the villain. See also one of my favorite rogue agent movies, “Shooter” (via IMDb), which stars Marky Mark Wahlberg as a putative assassination patsy who refuses to die and goes on to turn an FBI agent into his kill-em-all-let-deity-decide ally, and basically kills everyone in the sick deep state chain of command who conspired to end his life. Can’t lie, that movie was the first thing on my mind when the whole Tyler Robinson narrative began to unfold. And I’m sure other people who have feasted on the exploits of Jason Bourne and Bob Lee Swagger felt the same – even about Trump’s would be rally assassin in PA. I don’t know how the architects of this plan expect things to turn out. Hollywood isn’t the only show in town. I can’t wait for rebel film makers to start getting financing from China … LOL I can only assume that we’re headed to a point where the US is also going to have a “Great Firewall”, blocking content from the non-US-based platforms to which USians will flock when they abandon PalantirTok en masse. Get your VPNs ready! #MediaTechAISurveillanceAlliance So to echo dear Ben’s (jinx!) comment below, how does #OraParaPalantirTok think it’s going to put the genie back in the bottle? Are we on our way to people being arrested for posting pics of unalived Gazan families? Surveillance for the purpose of what exactly? Kicking kids out of college? More deportations? I agree with Ben here as well: too many people have seen outside their silo. And a lot of those people don’t necessarily inhabit the same political circles. I have had cause to visit Candace Owen’s YT tube page more times in the last month then for the entirety of my existence before Kirk’s death. And it’s not just what she’s saying, I also look at what the comments under her videos are saying. and some of those comments are eye-opening. Her last video was posted five hours ago (as of 1030PM US EDT), and has over 1.2M views already. People are questioning everything: • Why no autopsy? • Why is his wife acting as if nothing’s happened? • His weird security detail … their actions before and after In short, the stench is too strong … anyone who thinks 10/7 documentaries are gonna guilt people into letting go of pro-Palestinian sentiments this deep into this horrible Netanyahu campaign against Gaza, is as Nat asserts delusional. And what does it mean that we’ve reached the delusion phase of oligarchy? To borrow a phrase from Lambert, the deluded are very much akin to those who were clueless in Versailles. Thanks again, Nat, for this awesome post and the legwork it took to bring it to us. You can’t unsee dead kids. I think it’s that simple. If only it were that simple for some … (via YouTube) ChrisRUEcon: Thanks for the series of observations, which together are a diagnosis. And there is this that you wrote in regard to influencer (whoever they are ???) dipshittery: “Thanks for the tweets. They often serve as portals, not ends in and of themselves. One need only follow them via the comments and replies to realize again that this is not a one way street.” Yep. I don’t comment at YTube — the comments are a swamp. But they are a way of taking the temperature of USanians. I’d say that the U.S. two-party system is a flaking façade, papered with money, trying to keep the splits under its control. The Democrats are split beyond repair, with the Dem liberals desperately trying to control the Dem levellers, and the Republicans are split along MAGA paleoconservative, MAGA authoritarian, Calvinist cargo cult, and a group that advocates a kind of levelling. Equality in the U S of A is going to require levelling. Charlie Kirk was not up to the job, nor is Pete Buttigieg. The problem with portals into US-dominated comments sections at places like YTube is that you have many people who think expressing an opinion, of any kind, is some sort of political act. See FcBook and its swamp of memes. An opinion is an opinion is an opinion. The U.S. political arena (or “marketplace of ideas” to use a typical Anglosphere cliché) hasn’t approached dialectic. What is to be done? > What is to be done? Deft touch, sir … :) (via marxists.org) Oh to be in Chocolate City and not potentially be labeled a terrorist … LOL > the comments are a swamp. But they are a way of taking the temperature of USanians Precisely. In analyzing the various splits, I am reminded of the chemical definition of a catalyst – a substance that can speed up a reaction without participating in the reaction. If I were to try and pull some rusty knowledge out from high school memories … ahhh Vanadium Oxide somewhere in my text book … I would suggest Kirk’s murder is catalyst that has managed to create a (likely fleeting, but nevertheless potent) separation of the shared element that exists in both the left and right “political molecules”. Let us call that element AmDoPoSCoFi-UM … LOL “American Domestic Policy Should Come First” Think of all the Culture War ingredients as impurities that prevent the pure Amdoposcofium from shining forth in all its glory! And yet now … faced with the prospect (nee reality) that “the reason we cannot have nice things here” is because “our government is controlled by the inhumane, violent, sociopathic government of another country”, the impurities are being stripped away in real time. In one sense, you can assess this by what is absent from the comments. What types of comments do you typically see after a shooting? • 2A arguments • “Not the right time to politicize … ” • But but “gang bangers in Chicago” Far less so this time … Hasbara not working? Even with TikTok, I’m not sure this genie goes back in the bottle. Too many people have seen outside their silo. Americans’ Support for Israel Dramatically Declines, Times/Siena Poll Finds (NYT article) Raw data (NYT) In the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, American voters broadly sympathized with Israelis over Palestinians, with 47 percent siding with Israel and 20 percent with Palestinians. In the new poll, 34 percent said they sided with Israel and 35 percent with Palestinians. Thirty-one percent said they were unsure or backed both equally. A majority of American voters now oppose sending additional economic and military aid to Israel, a stunning reversal in public opinion since the Oct. 7 attacks. About six out of 10 voters said that Israel should end its military campaign, even if the remaining Israeli hostages were not released or Hamas was not eliminated. And 40 percent of voters said Israel was intentionally killing civilians in Gaza, nearly double the number of voters who agreed with that statement in the 2023 poll. Younger voters, regardless of party, were less likely to back continuing that support. Nearly seven in 10 voters under 30 said they opposed additional economic or military aid. Much of the shift in views on Israel has been driven by a sharp decline in support by Democratic voters. Republicans largely continue to support Israel, though there has been a modest decline…. …Yet even Republican support has fallen, albeit by significantly less. Republicans still sympathize with Israel more than Palestinians, 64 percent to 9 percent. But those numbers indicate a drop in support of 12 percentage points since 2023, when 76 percent sided with Israel. About a third of Republicans said Israel’s military was not taking enough action to prevent civilian deaths. > I’m not sure this genie goes back in the bottle Ha! Jinx! And I’m not even a Chris :) Fantastic work Nat! And it helps to have the links to your earlier pieces plus the additional on-line stuff for review as you piece together this grotesque crazy quilt. Historically it’s probably always been something like this but it is really something being able to see so many uber wealthy coming up from the depths to strut their stuff and make their moves. Yes, agreed. Nate is doing Lambert level work and is much appreciated. Larry Ellison has the proverbial face that needs punching. speaking of “the proverbial face that needs punching”, once upon a time in a prior life, i worked in the same redwood shores tower that that slimy now-billionaire had his offices. dreaded taking the lifts due to the chance of meeting him therein. legends said he fired people for being in the lift with him. being h1b, the risk was great. that entire corpse was made in his image, btw … Great post, Nat. I am really enjoying your contributions to NC! Regarding your final point: I think this theory is mostly accurate. I think Israel may be the only country that offers a path to citizenship purely through religious affiliation, and (at least until the Kahanists/State of Judea types solidify their grip on long term power) it doesn’t actually require real religious dogma if the halacha rule of a Jewish mother and the associated birth and congregation records are available. Combined with several other aspects (Israel’s extradition policy, the extremely dense startup/financier community, the extreme overlap between civilian/military/intelligence communities due to mass conscription) it would not surprise me to find out there is not just one ‘big group’ but many groups that leverage their relationships to the state and the supra- and trans-national state organizations to profit in various ways. Regarding Ellison explicitly this tidbit may be of interest in terms of ‘why TikTok, why now’: A close friend of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ellison has been named as a potential witness in the trial against the Likud leader as part of Case 2000, the alleged bribery affair involving Yediot Ahronot. Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lania, which he purchased in 2012 for some $300 million. Among his contributions to Israeli causes are more than $26 million given to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, as well as $500,000 to fortify a community center in Sderot in 2007. From this hagiographic fluff piece from 2021. <"Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lania" Or Lānaʻi as we call it here, though commonly written Lanai as, let's face it, using diacritics isn't a USian thing. But other than refurbing the two resorts on the island, can't see that Ellison has had any impact whatsoever here. Or if he has it doesn't get any reporting. Living in Greece but was back in Northern California for a wedding this summer. Lived there till 2021. Just anecdata but an acquaintance, staunch right wing Trump supporter, very Christian was appalled at what was happening in Gaza. I remember him being a Ben Shapiro stan back in the day also. When you’ve lost someone like him then I think the percentages of Israel support among the republicans, esp the America first crowd, may be even lower than the polls capture. To add, back in 2021 the area (Yuba City/Marysville and surrounding countryside) was chock fulla Trump signs and American flags. I didn’t see one sign this time around. Think the rural population feels duped, esp as cheap farm labor gets rounded up. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

An analyst's concerns about demand for Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drugs is weighing on the drugmaker's shares to start the week. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) slid in recent trading following a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, which raised concerns about demand for the company's GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as their effectiveness in fighting Alzheimer’s disease. The bank dropped its rating to “underweight” from “equal weight,” and lowered the price target to $47 from $59. The stock was recently down less than 1% to below $55, slightly extending year-to-date declines. Morgan Stanley has downgraded Novo Nordisk, whose U.S. shares are already down a third this year. That downgrade forecasts slowing demand for weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, generic competition abroad, and trial results that may disappoint those looking for an Alzheimer’s breakthrough. Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that “prescriptions for Ozempic and Wegovy have been stagnating in the US; we forecast a decline in the US GLP-1 diabetes franchise in 2026 due to market share and price pressure, and we expect Ozempic ex-US growth to be impacted by the first generic competition in Canada and emerging markets.” The analysts said that they believe the results of trials of Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 treatments for Alzheimer’s disease coming in the next few week will likely fall short of showing statistically significant outcomes. AndtThey warned about the downside risks of potential price cuts for Ozempic and Wegovy in Medicare Part D plans, as well as doubts about the company’s experimental obesity/diabetes combination drug CagriSemi outperforming rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost a third of their value this year.

Title: A look at today's billionaires a century after Rockefeller became the first

Watch CBS News Updated on: September 29, 2025 / 12:44 PM EDT / CBS News On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire. More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth — approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel. Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today. There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing. Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 — up from 813 in 2024. Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports. And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 — about 15% more than its 2023 estimate. Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates. Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set. His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29. Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, "The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people." Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024. In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth "could be turned into cash and distributed equally—which it couldn't—[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each." Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person. Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over. Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades — toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age. The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data. "What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses," said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas. But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri. By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth — up over 10 percentage points from 1980. Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country — or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023. The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023. Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways. The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men — about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes — and most make rather than inherit their wealth. Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of "A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era." "He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks," Nichols said. "But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time." Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data. Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather. Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.

Title: SEC Intends to Allow Dimensional to Offer Dual Share Class Funds

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs.

Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “Now that the SEC has signed off, the real work will begin. There’s matters of logistics, economics and the economics of logistics to attend to and it will likely be years before we see ETF share classes proliferate and become broadly and easily accessible via conversions of existing mutual fund share class holdings,” said Morningstar’s Ben Johnson. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: SEC Set to Allow Dimensional to Offer Dual Share Class Funds

The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. The decision is a potential watershed moment for US money managers, more than 70 of which have sought permission from the SEC to adopt the dual-class structure. ETFs have become the investment vehicle of choice for Americans over the last decade thanks to their favorable tax status and ease of use. They’ve attracted trillions of dollars in inflows while mutual funds bled assets. The SEC published a notice on Monday saying it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. It comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its application on Friday. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Regulatory approval would be a big win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Change of Pace Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s acting chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “Mutual fund-class shareholders could benefit through lower transaction costs and greater tax efficiency, while ETF-class shareholders could also benefit from more efficient rebalancing using mutual fund cash flows and lower total portfolio transaction costs,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm at Dimensional, said in a press release. Big Shake Up The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs. In 2024, mutual funds shed a net $451 billion, while their exchange-traded counterparts — which typically offer superior tax efficiency and liquidity — took in a record $1.1 trillion, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that the SEC has signed off, the real work will begin. There’s matters of logistics, economics and the economics of logistics to attend to and it will likely be years before we see ETF share classes proliferate and become broadly and easily accessible via conversions of existing mutual fund share class holdings,” said Morningstar’s Ben Johnson.

September 29, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoRL -- NVIDIA today announced that the open‑source Newton Physics Engine is now available in NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab, along with the open NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.6 reasoning vision language action model for robot skills and new AI infrastructure. Together, these technologies provide developers and researchers with an open, accelerated robotics platform that speeds iteration, standardizes testing, unifies training with on‑robot inference and helps robots transfer skills safely and reliably from simulation to the real world. “Humanoids are the next frontier of physical AI, requiring the ability to reason, adapt and act safely in an unpredictable world,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “With these latest updates, developers now have the three computers to bring robots from research into everyday life — with Isaac GR00T serving as robot’s brains, Newton simulating their body and NVIDIA Omniverse as their training ground.” Newton Opens New Standard for Physical Simulation in RoboticsRobots learn faster and safer in simulation, but humanoid robots — with their complex joints, balance and movements — push today’s physics engines to the limit. Over a quarter-million robotics developers worldwide need accurate physics, so the skills they teach robots in simulation can be executed safely and reliably in the real world. Today, NVIDIA announced the beta release of Newton, an open-source, GPU-accelerated physics engine, managed by the Linux Foundation. Built on the NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD frameworks, and codeveloped by Google DeepMind, Disney Research and NVIDIA, Newton is available now. With Newton’s flexible design and ability to work with different types of physics solvers, developers can now simulate extremely complex robot actions, like walking through snow or gravel and handling cups and fruits, and successfully deploy them in the real world. The latest adopters of Newton are esteemed research labs and universities such as ETH Zurich Robotic Systems Lab, Technical University of Munich and Peking University, robotics company Lightwheel, and simulation engine company Style3D. Cosmos Reason Improves Robot Reasoning for New Open Isaac GR00T N1.6 ModelTo perform humanlike tasks in the physical world, humanoids must understand ambiguous instructions and deal with the long tail of never-before-seen experiences. The latest release of the open Isaac GR00T N1.6 robot foundation model, available soon on Hugging Face, will integrate NVIDIA Cosmos™ Reason, an open, customizable reasoning vision language model built for physical AI. Acting as the robot’s deep-thinking brain, Cosmos Reason turns vague instructions into step-by-step plans, using prior knowledge, common sense and physics to handle new situations and generalize across many tasks. Cosmos Reason, downloaded over 1 million times and currently at the top of the Physical Reasoning Leaderboard on Hugging Face, can also curate and annotate large sets of real and synthetic data for model training. Cosmos Reason 1 is now available as an easy-to-use NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for AI model deployment. Isaac GR00T N1.6 now lets humanoids move and handle objects simultaneously, allowing more torso and arm freedom to complete tough tasks like opening heavier doors. Developers can post-train Isaac GR00T N models using the open-source NVIDIA Physical AI Dataset on Hugging Face. Downloaded over 4.8 million times, the dataset now includes thousands of synthetic and real-world trajectories. Leading robot makers such as AeiROBOT, Franka Robotics, LG Electronics, Lightwheel, Mentee Robotics, Neura Robotics, Solomon, Techman Robot and UCR are evaluating Isaac GR00T N models for building general-purpose robots. New Cosmos World Foundation Models for Physical AI Development NVIDIA announced new updates to its open Cosmos WFMs, downloaded over 3 million times, that let developers generate diverse data for accelerating training physical AI models at scale using text, image and video prompts. New Workflow for Teaching Robot Grasping Teaching a robot to grab an object is one of the most difficult challenges in robotics. It is not just about moving an arm but turning a thought into a precise action — a skill robots must learn through trial and error. The new dexterous grasping workflow in the developer preview of Isaac Lab 2.3, built on the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform, trains multi-fingered hand and arm robots in a virtual world using an automated curriculum. It starts with simple tasks and gradually ramps up the complexity. The workflow changes aspects like gravity, friction and the weight of an object, training robots to learn skills even in unpredictable environments. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robots learned grasping using this workflow to significantly improve its manipulation capabilities. Leading robot developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Hexagon, Skild AI, Solomon and Techman Robot are adopting NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse technologies. Evaluating Learned Robot Skills in SimulationGetting a robot to master a new skill — like picking up a cup or walking across a room — is incredibly difficult, and testing these skills on a physical robot is slow and expensive. The solution lies in simulation, which offers a way to test a robot’s learned skills against countless scenarios, tasks and environments. But even in simulation, developers tend to build fragmented, simplified tests that do not reflect the real world. A robot that learns to navigate a perfect, simple simulation will fail the moment it faces real-world complexity. To let developers run complex, large-scale evaluations in a simulated environment without having to build the system from scratch, NVIDIA and Lightwheel are codeveloping Isaac Lab - Arena, an open-source policy evaluation framework for scalable experimentation and standardized testing. The framework will be available soon. New NVIDIA AI Infrastructure Powers Robotics Workloads AnywhereTo enable developers to take full advantage of these advanced technologies and software libraries, NVIDIA announced AI infrastructure designed for the most demanding workloads, including: NVIDIA Advances Robotics ResearchNVIDIA technologies, including GPUs, simulation frameworks and CUDA®‑accelerated libraries, were referenced in nearly half of CoRL’s accepted papers — with adoption across leading research labs and institutions such as Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, ETH Zurich and National University of Singapore.

Title: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors among healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital in Ghana: A cross-sectional survey
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0333412

Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions, but its hesitancy still poses a challenge in achieving acceptable coverage. This study was designed to assess the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and identify its influencing factors among healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in Ghana. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test of independence, and multiple logistic regression were assessed from the data collected using Stata version 14 software. A response rate of 78.55% (n = 216/275) was recorded. The majority of the participants were females (n = 135, 62.50%), aged between 20–39 years (n = 204, 94.44%), and were nurses/ midwives (n = 140, 64.81%) followed by medical doctors (n = 43, 19.91%). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 19.91% and the commonly cited reasons for this were apathy (n = 8/43, 18.60%) followed by the belief of not being at risk of infection with the virus (n = 7/43, 16.28%). Hesitancy was reduced by participant’s knowledge of the vaccine effectiveness (aOR= 0.01; CI 95%: 0.001–0.0996; p < 0.001), COVID-19 training (aOR= 0.34; CI 95%: 0.13–0.85; p = 0.022), having a past vaccination history (aOR= 0.18, CI 95%: 0.07–0.45; p < 0.001), and increased by those with the view that vaccine intake should be voluntary (aOR= 3.28; CI 95%: 1.08–10.01; p = 0.037). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was recorded among healthcare workers in this teaching hospital with apathy and belief of no risk to being infected by the virus as commonly cited reasons for this. This is a concern as healthcare workers are expected to be well-informed of the benefits and risks of vaccination. Continuous education on vaccine safety and efficacy can improve vaccine uptake among this population.

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus disease that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 [1]. Since then, the disease has had a significant impact on lives and economies worldwide [2–4]. The outbreak originated as pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China [5]. Ghana recorded its first two cases of COVID-19 on March 12, 2020, and as at June 23, 2024, there had been a total of 775 million cases and 7 million deaths worldwide, with 172,045 cases and 1,462 deaths in Ghana [3,6]. Initial national responses included case identification, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation of infected persons, social distancing, and the widespread use of face masks and hand sanitizers [7]. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions for combating the spread of infectious diseases in the general population [8,9]. According to the WHO, at least 70% vaccination coverage is needed to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism for COVID-19 [10], although higher thresholds have been proposed to address more transmissible variants such as Delta and Omicron [10–12]. Despite this evidence, vaccination campaigns worldwide have been constrained by vaccine hesitancy [13–15]. Vaccine hesitancy is defined by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) as the delay in accepting or refusing vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services [16]. It is acknowledged to be complex, context-specific, and dynamic, shaped by factors of complacency, convenience, and confidence [17,18]. Within Ghana, studies exploring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers have reported divergent findings. For example, Agyekum et al. (2021) documented a hesitancy prevalence of 60.7% among healthcare workers in Accra, a strikingly high figure at the time of early vaccine rollout [19]. Similar rates of such hesitancy have been observed among this group in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries [20–24]. These further highlight the role of vaccine efficacy and safety, availability and accessibility, vaccination history, occupational status, societal and peer influence and conspiracy theories in shaping vaccine attitudes among health professionals in Ghana [19,23–27]. These discrepancies reflect differences in study timing, geographical location, cadre of health workers sampled, and the evolving information environment. Several studies have been conducted globally to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population in most countries [28–32]. Given that healthcare workers are at increased occupational risk and serve as trusted sources of health information for the wider population, understanding the factors underlying their vaccination decisions remains a critical public health priority. However, while several studies have assessed vaccine hesitancy among the general population in Ghana, relatively fewer have focused specifically on healthcare workers and particularly those in teaching hospitals [19,22–24,27,33]. The present study therefore seeks to assess the prevalence and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among frontline clinical staff at Ho Teaching Hospital in the Volta Region of Ghana, thereby contributing to the limited but growing body of Ghanaian evidence on this subject. The study was conducted in Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH), a 354-bed capacity tertiary health facility located in the Volta Regional capital, Ho in Ghana [34]. It has about 1200 clinical and non-clinical staff. The clinical departments in the hospital are Surgery, Internal Medicine, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pharmacy, Laboratory and Radiology. The hospital is patronized by walk-ins and referred clients from the region and clients from neighbouring countries including the Republic of Togo, Benin, and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It provides general and specialised services to about 7000 outpatients and 3000 in-patients every year [35]. The study focused on front-line clinical healthcare workers as they are more likely to come into contact with COVID-19 patients. The targeted study participants included medical doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and laboratory personnel. The breakdown of the target group is as follows: 24 pharmacists, 94 doctors, 110 laboratory personnel, and 862 nurses and midwives. The Raosoft online sample size calculator was used to estimate the sample size. Based on a margin of error of 5%, confidence level of 95%, population size of 1090, and a hesitancy response of 60.7%, which was based on a similar previous study [19], the calculated sample size was 275. The various targeted healthcare workers were recruited based on their calculated population proportional to their size; leading to the recruitment of 24 medical doctors, 6 pharmacists, 217 nurses and midwives and 28 laboratory personnel. The questionnaires were then distributed to them to respond to after they had consented to participate in the study. The data for this study were collected with a structured self-administered questionnaire (supplementary file) that was administered both via Google online form and paper-based questionnaire. Data were collected between 1st June 2023 and 30th August 2023. The questionnaire was adapted from previous similar studies [19,20,23]. It had three sections which consisted of sociodemographic factors including age, sex, religion, marital status, education level and occupation; participants’ job details including type of occupation, years of practice, and role at the COVID-19 treatment at the facility; clinical characteristics and vaccine history including medical history, COVID-19 vaccine type, number of doses and vaccine acceptance/ refusal, participants’ knowledge, and perception concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, and reasons for refusal and acceptance of vaccine. The outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy, and this was defined as one’s refusal to take the vaccine in spite of its availability [16]. The data obtained from the online Google forms and hardcopy questionnaires were entered into a Microsoft Excel version 2016 sheet. The data were then cleaned and imported to Stata version 14 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for analysis. Descriptive statistics in the form of percentages of variables, and then Chi-square test of independence were performed to assess the association between these variables and the outcome variable (status of vaccine hesitancy). Multiple logistic regression was then conducted for the variables that showed statistical significance with a p-value less than 0.05 to assess for the predictors of vaccine hesitancy. Ethical clearance was sought from the Ethics Committees of both the University of Health and Allied Science (UHAS-REC A.7 [46] 22–23) and Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH-REC (36) FC_2022). Written informed consents were sought from both online and in-person participants before the commencement of the study. Information on the participant information leaflet which included study details, and the benefits and risks of participating were given to each participant. Data collected were anonymized to safeguard confidentiality and kept secured with the principal investigator. A total of 216 healthcare workers responded to the survey giving a 78.55% response rate. Majority were females (n = 135, 62.50%) and aged between 20–39 years (n = 204, 94.44%), were Christians (n = 212, 98.15%) and had never been married (n = 147, 68.06%). (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t001 Nurses and midwives (n = 140, 64.81%) were the most common occupation, followed by medical doctors (n = 43, 19.91%), and undergraduate/diploma qualification n = 184, 85.19%) was commonest highest educational level. Majority of them had been practicing for less than 10 years (n = 199, 92.13%). Majority had been previously vaccinated (n = 199, 92.13%). Most of them had no chronic diseases (n = 206, 95.37%) and had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the inception of the pandemic (n = 173, 80.09%). The majority of the respondents did not have a family member who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 184, 85.58%). Most of the healthcare workers had come into contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 152, 70.37%). Most of them had received training on COVID-19 via a lecture mode (n = 132, 61.11%) (Table 1). Of the 216 participants, few of them had refused accepting the COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., hesitant) (n = 43, 19.91%). Most commonly cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy were apathy towards taking the vaccine (n = 8/43, 18.60%), followed by belief of not being at risk of infection with the virus (n = 7/43, 16.28%). 63 out of the 173 participants who delayed in taking the vaccine cited reasons of uncertainty about the long-term adverse effect of vaccine (n = 28/63, 44.44%), and poor accessibility to vaccine (n = 6/63, 9.52%). The most (n = 72/173, 41.62%) commonly cited reason for taking the COVID-19 vaccine was the perceived risk of infection from COVID-19 (41.62%) followed by workplace requirement (n = 34/173, 19.65). The commonest brand of vaccine received by most participants was ChAdOx-1s (n = 92/173, 19.08%), followed by Ad26.COV2-S (n = 33/173, 19.08%). The majority of the participants (149/173, 86.13%) who accepted vaccination received the full dose of the vaccine, and most of them (n = 111/173, 64.16%) did not receive booster doses. (Table 2) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t002 Most (n = 130/216, 60.19%) responded that COVID-19 vaccines should be voluntary for healthcare workers. Furthermore, most (n = 160/216, 74.07%) of them responded that vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19 and that they (n = 185/216, 85.65%) would advise their friends and family to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Most of them responded that their views on the COVID-19 vaccine had not changed over time (n = 139/216, 64.35%). (Table 2) Vaccine hesitancy was associated with gender status (p = 0.031), being a member of the COVID care team (p = 0.019), having received any other vaccination apart from childhood vaccines (p < 0.001), having attended COVID-19 lecture (p = 0.011), view of the vaccine requirement for health workers (p < 0.001), knowledge of the vaccine being an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and whether the person would recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to friends and family (p < 0.001) (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t003 Vaccine hesitancy was predicted by participant’s knowledge of the vaccine being an effective means of preventing and controlling the disease (aOR= 0.01; CI 95%: 0.01–0.00; p < 0.001), COVID-19 training via lecture method (aOR= 0.34; CI 95%: 0.13–0.85; p = 0.022), their view on vaccine requirement for health workers (aOR= 3.28; CI 95%: 1.08–10.01; p = 0.037). past vaccination history (aOR= 0.18, CI 95%: 0.07–0.45; p < 0.001). (Table 4) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t004 This study found a COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy prevalence of 19.91% among frontline clinical healthcare workers at Ho Teaching Hospital. When situated within the broader Ghanaian literature, this prevalence is relatively low. For instance, Agyekum et al. (2021) reported a much higher hesitancy rate of 60.7% among healthcare workers in Accra at the onset of the vaccine rollout [19]. Similarly, Lamptey et al. (2022) and Botwe et al. (2022) documented high levels of uncertainty and refusal in other Ghanaian cohorts [22,27]. In contrast, our findings align more closely with those of Alhassan et al. (2021) in Northern Ghana, who reported that a majority of healthcare workers were willing to accept vaccination, particularly when vaccines were accessible and clear communication was provided [23]. The lower hesitancy we observed may reflect the timing of our study, which was conducted when vaccines were more widely available, when healthcare workers had greater exposure to training and public campaigns, and when local experiences with COVID-19 outcomes may have reinforced the perceived importance of vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers is particularly concerning given its benefits in protecting this vulnerable population due to increased exposure and their critical role in influencing public perception and vaccine uptake [14,15,18]. The finding that hesitancy among healthcare workers was not substantially lower than in the general population in this study and others in Ghana highlights a missed opportunity to leverage healthcare workers as vaccination advocates [30,36,37]. Apathy and a self-perceived low risk of infection emerged as the most frequently cited reasons for hesitancy, agreeing with findings from studies in Saudi Arabia and France [30–32]. This persistent misperception of risk among healthcare workers is concerning, as it may undermine compliance with future vaccination campaigns and weaken broader public health interventions if left unaddressed. This study identified several factors significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Female gender, not having received prior adult vaccinations, lack of COVID-19 training, belief that vaccination should be voluntary, and doubts about the vaccine’s effectiveness were all predictive of hesitancy. Gender has been identified as a predictor of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers [38–40]. The finding of the influence of gender on vaccine hesitancy is consistent with a previous study indicating that female healthcare workers are more likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy, often due to fears surrounding infertility or rare side effects, such as thromboembolic events associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine [40,41]. This is particularly relevant in Ghana, where AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) was the most widely administered vaccine during the initial phases of the vaccination campaign [42]. A negative past vaccination history emerged as a strong predictor of hesitancy (aOR = 0.01, p < 0.001), reaffirming findings from other settings that vaccine confidence is often built on positive historical experiences with immunization [43,44]. Similarly, healthcare workers who had undergone COVID-19 training via lecture mode demonstrated reduced hesitancy (aOR = 0.34, p = 0.022), reinforcing the value of structured educational interventions in promoting vaccine acceptance [16–18]. Another crucial determinant was the belief in the vaccine’s effectiveness to prevent and control COVID-19, which significantly lowered the likelihood of hesitancy (aOR = 0.08, p < 0.001), as was proposed by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy [16]. Notably, healthcare workers who believed that vaccines should be mandatory for healthcare professionals and those who were willing to recommend vaccination to others also showed lower hesitancy, aligning with similar findings in global and African studies [20,43,44]. Despite its valuable contributions, this study has limitations. First, the use of convenience sampling may introduce selection bias and limit the generalizability of findings. Second, the cross-sectional design restricts causal inference, and the use of a single tertiary hospital as the study site may not capture broader national or regional trends. However, the study remains significant as it adds to the limited empirical evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana and highlights the need for context-specific strategies to address misinformation, build vaccine confidence, and support institutional trust. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana, while relatively low, remains a public health concern. The study found that vaccine hesitancy among the study population is primarily driven by apathy, a perceived low risk of infection, and concerns about vaccine safety. Significant predictors of hesitancy included female gender, a lack of prior adult vaccination, absence of formal COVID-19 training, and low confidence in the vaccine’s effectiveness. Conversely, prior vaccination, training via lectures, belief in the vaccine’s protective value, and willingness to recommend it to others were associated with lower hesitancy. The predictors of vaccine hesitancy were participants’ knowledge of the vaccine effectiveness, COVID-19 training via lecture method, health workers’ view on whether the vaccine should be voluntary, and the knowledge of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing and controlling COVID-19. Taken together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana. They confirm that hesitancy is not static but responsive to evolving conditions such as vaccine availability and training opportunities. They also illustrate that interventions must be context-specific, as strategies that are effective in a tertiary teaching hospital may differ from those needed in rural or primary care settings. From a policy perspective, the relatively low hesitancy observed in this study suggests that structured training programs and institutional support can play a critical role in building vaccine confidence among healthcare workers. Targeted education, particularly addressing gender-specific concerns, should be prioritized. Additionally, leveraging positive vaccination histories and ensuring that healthcare workers themselves are well-informed and supported could enhance their role as advocates for vaccination in the general population. By documenting these determinants, this study not only complements earlier Ghanaian reports but also highlights pathways through which vaccine hesitancy can be effectively reduced among health professionals in similar contexts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.s001 (DOCX)

Intel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments. The stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company. Analysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring. Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week. Importantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023. Let’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range. A successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year. Finally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.

Title: The GOOGL Stock Shareholder Jackpot

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past 10 years, Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has provided an impressive $343 billion to its shareholders through actual cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has accelerated dramatically in 2025, with the stock delivering an exceptional 30% return year-to-date, substantially outperforming the broader market and cementing its position among the year's top-performing mega-cap technology stocks. Alphabet's evolution into a dividend-paying powerhouse reached a milestone this year when the company announced a 5% increase to its quarterly dividend in April 2025, raising the payout to $0.21 per share from the inaugural $0.20 dividend introduced in 2024 - marking the tech giant's transformation from a pure growth story to a balanced capital allocation champion. The company's commitment to rewarding shareholders was further amplified through the authorization of a massive $70 billion share repurchase program in Q1 2025, one of the largest buyback announcements in corporate history, demonstrating management's confidence in the business amid robust financial performance. During the first half of 2025 alone, Alphabet generated impressive revenue growth with Q1 revenues of $90.23 billion (up 12% year-over-year) and Q2 revenues reaching $96.4 billion (up 14% year-over-year), providing the cash flow foundation that enables both aggressive capital returns and continued investment in AI infrastructure and cloud computing expansion. Let’s examine some figures and see how this payout capability compares with the substantial capital-return entities in the market. This provides a solid summary, but assessing a stock from an investment perspective entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to do. It is structured to mitigate stock-specific risks while allowing for potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – Why MSFT Stock Is A Shareholder's Paradise? Why is the shareholder return important? Because dividends and share repurchases constitute direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also demonstrate management’s confidence in the financial health of the company and its ability to generate reliable cash flows. Furthermore, more companies exhibit similar traits. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital delivered back to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. Interestingly, GOOGL ranks 3rd for the highest amount returned to shareholders in history. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What observations can you make? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as META and MSFT are experiencing much faster growth in a more predictable manner compared to others, yet they have provided a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That’s the trade-off associated with substantial capital returns. While they may seem appealing, it's essential to question: Am I compromising growth and solid fundamentals? With that in mind, let's examine GOOGL's performance. (Refer to Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock for further information) Nevertheless, GOOGL is not without the risk of significant declines. It dropped 65% during the Global Financial Crisis, lost roughly 44% in the inflation shock, and encountered a 31% pullback during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even more minor corrections, like in 2018, resulted in a decrease of about 23%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during periods of volatility, even leading stocks can experience turmoil. Also, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: On the latest Masters in Business Podcast. Strap yourself in another great one. Dmitri bni. He’s co-founder of the Hedge Fund, Balyasny Asset Management. They’re a $28 billion multi-Strat firm, 170 portfolio teams. 2300 people working in their offices around the world. He started as a trader at Schoenfeld, grew into both a manager and just a person looking at the world and identifying inefficiencies and coming up with ways to capitalize in it. Fascinating conversation. Not only are they one of the most successful multi-strats, but they have a somewhat unusual business manager. They have lots of partners who are employees, traders, business people, fund managers. Really just, just a fascinating approach to corporate culture, to creating the right set of incentives and and creating a high functioning meritocracy. Very few people have seen the world of hedge funds develop from a trading perspective the way Dmitri has. I thought the conversation was absolutely spectacular and I think you will also. With no further ado, my discussion with Dmitri Balyasny: Dmitry Balyasny: Thanks for having me, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: And we got to say hello to Mike on the way in. We’ll, we’ll talk about that a little later. I’m fascinated by your background. You immigrated from the Ukraine at age seven. How did that affect your perspective in terms of taking risk and just looking at the world? Dmitry Balyasny: I think it was probably very formative in building a thick skin, right? So back in Kiev we’re living in communist, Soviet Union. Parents would stand in line to buy jug of milk for a couple hours. I’d never been in a car until I was in the us. Never taken a flight until we immigrated. So very different life there. A lot of discrimination from a religious perspective, an ethnic perspective being Jewish and gave at the time, and then coming here and didn’t speak the language. Different type of discrimination from being Russian during the height of the Cold War, although never really thought of ourselves as Russian. So it builds, you know, I think it builds character and builds, you know, perseverance in the thick skin to be able to deal with the difficulties and figure stuff out. Barry Ritholtz: You go to college at Loyola University in Chicago where you study business. What was the career plan? Dmitry Balyasny: I wanted to invest, so I did a lot of sales type jobs in high school because I figured out that was the only way you could get paid because you got commissioned as opposed to salary as a kid. But I wanted to transition from selling stocks as a stockbroker, which I was doing in college to trading and taking risk and, and investing. I wasn’t sure how I was gonna do that and what format, but I was interested in trading and investing from a young age. Read, you know, market wizards, you know, followed the careers of the top traders at the time, applied to every hedge fund I could find. And I was lucky enough to answer a newspaper out of all things when Schoenfeld Securities ran a newspaper ad in Chicago when they opened up that office and it was the one and only time they actually ran a newspaper ad. So I was lucky that I was following the want ads every week… Barry Ritholtz: I recall seeing, you know, traders wanted Schoenfeld Securities. That’s right. They were down on Wall Street back in the mid nineties. So you begin trading for Schoenfeld in the mid 1990s. What was the trading environment like? What were you doing for them on the desk? Dmitry Balyasny: Well, at the time, they were looking for people who didn’t have a lot of preconceived notions and kind of systems and strategies that they really thought worked because they wanted to start them from scratch and kind of teach them their methodology, which was working well at the time. And that fit me very well because I was making a lot of money for at the time in commissions as a broker. But I was promptly losing at trading because I didn’t know what I was doing. From a trading standpoint, Barry Ritholtz: You had to support your trading habit with commission sales. Dmitry Balyasny: Yeah, exactly. Exactly, exactly. And so I would give people lots of great advice and then proceed to go do the opposite and, and my own trading. So I needed to go somewhere to learn a method that had more structure and discipline. And so they started you with a very small amount of capital, but, and very tight risk limits in terms of, you know, what you could trade when you could trade how, you know, what size you could trade. And from there, once you showed some proficiency, your risk box would expand, Barry Ritholtz: Meaning more capital, little, little looser rains. That’s right. On what you could do when that’s right, how long you could hold things. Dmitry Balyasny: That’s right. And so I started with, you know, very short time periods, very small risk, didn’t make any money for the first year, which was difficult because the salary was zero. But after that I started kind of getting the hang of it and making money pretty consistently. Barry Ritholtz: How did you work your way through the various roles at Schoenfeld? ’cause eventually you end up allocating for their internal funds, right? Dmitry Balyasny: Yeah, so it was a almost completely flat management structure. So at one point there were over a thousand people on the trading side. Wow. And there was a handful of people in senior management and, you know, virtually no people in middle management. It was very, very flat. And so you were basically a trader. You could run a group of traders or you were just managing and not really trading. And so I kind of worked my way up from a pure trading position where after I was successful for three or four years, I went to Steven and asked him if I could start hiring people to trade some of my risk. And he was kind enough to say, sure, if you’re willing to pay for them, you can hire them. And that was good enough for me. And so I did the same thing. I ran an ad in the paper and I started hiring the initial traders, some of whom are still with us today, 25 years later. Wow. So, and then I would allocate some of my risk to them. And then as that became more successful, I hired more traders, eventually analyst, eventually portfolio managers, and we spun off into a division. And while I was doing that, Steve gave me the opportunity to co-invest in a portfolio of hedge fund managers, external managers that we would allocate to. And that was a great experience. I got to meet a lot of the top hedge fund guys at the time. Barry Ritholtz: So from building a whole division at schoenfeld, what led you to found Bally Os Asset management? Dmitry Balyasny: I was always very entrepreneurial into, so again, it was like a very flat firm. So I always felt like I was building my own business. And our strategy started to divert from the rest of the firm. Like we became more fundamental. We were holding things longer, we needed to meet with company management, so we needed sell side coverage. And so that led to separate office space, separate strategies, different types of PMs and traders that we wanted to hire. And eventually it led to needing to take in external capital because it was a more higher capacity, you know, type of strategy that demanded external capital. And so we gradually moved from, you know, an internal group to a division, to a proprietary funded, you know, hedge fund to a traditional, you know, externally funded hedge fund over a few years. Barry Ritholtz: So we’ll talk a little later about some of the technology that you guys have built internally, but mid nineties had to be an incredible environment for trading, and it seemed like every month it was a whole different set of technology that came down the pike. Tell us about your experiences in the nineties and are there any parallels to what’s going on today? Dmitry Balyasny: Well, I think the world has moved, you know, tremendously in terms of the trading technologies that, that people are using today. When I think about, at the time that I first started as a broker, that’s really gonna date me. But we had, you know, one monitor that would be on a little carousel that you would spin around between four different brokers when you needed a quote, right? And when I started trading at Chfa, we had a person whose job it was to be the printer reader. And so you didn’t get your fills electronically, you would get your fills coming back on a printer, and some poor guy’s job was to read out your prints, you know, so you would know where you got filled. So, you know, you contrast that with all the AI and data, you know, technology today that, that we and others use for, for trading and investing. And it’s just, you know, tremendously different world from the overall kind of technologies coming through the pike. The internet, I would say was, you know, a bigger change in terms of going from, you know, very little interaction, I would say with, with technology for most companies at the time. And, and really most individual people to, you know, tremendously kind of jumping in and trying to figure it out. Although I think AI will likely be a larger, you know, more substantive change over time. We’re coming from a place where everybody’s already, you know, enmeshed in technology in so many different ways, whether you’re an individual with your, your phone, your computers, your laptops, or you know, your, your meta glasses, et cetera. Or a company with, you know, zillions of engineers. So I think it’ll be more profound over the long term, but the change feels a little bit less than it did at the time. Barry Ritholtz: I mean, there’s no doubt the internet was a sea change. Being able to plug into the hive mind was huge. Mobile was pretty big. But it sounds like you’re saying artificial intelligence has the potential to be even a bigger change agent than Dmitry Balyasny: Yeah, I think so. I think over time, I think in terms of actual usefulness over time and ability to make you better and smarter in lots of different tasks at work, at home, et cetera. I use these apps, you know, every day and they’re still, you know, very new and rough. So you, but you could see at the rate of improvement, if you project it out and you think about like where these are gonna be in 5, 10, 15 years, like, I think it’ll be, you know, pretty transformative. Barry Ritholtz: One of the things that really separates Bally, the asset management from many other large multi-strat hedge funds are the amount of technology that you develop internally, tools, apps, research databases. Tell a little bit, tell, discuss a little bit about what’s it like to constantly being on the bleeding edge of technology. Sure. Dmitry Balyasny: So this was a big evolution for us. I would say over the last, you know, 6, 7, 8 years, first 15 plus years, we mostly used external technologies and we had a pretty small internal tech team. And the idea was basically give people all the support that they needed, all the supporting type of tools, but do as much off the shelf as you can. And over time, as we expanded different strategies and added, you know, macro and commodities and quant and these more technologically sophisticated strategies, we really found that we needed to build a lot more things internally. And so now today we have 500 plus people in technology, another a hundred plus people in, in data teams and AI teams. And we build a lot of really outstanding tools that not only support the investing teams, but really enable a lot of the investing functions, whether it’s trading, research, risk, even operational in some aspects. When we have folks come over from other, other firms, a lot of times they’re, we, because we don’t really advertise it that much. A lot of times people are kind of blown away by some of the things that we’ve developed. Barry Ritholtz: So when I think of technology, I think of things, when you say trading, execution, the ability to get best execution, but risk is a big challenge. How do you identify how much risk is within a portfolio? And given that you’re multi-Strat, how much do the, does the risk cancel each other out? How do you do that analysis? That seems like, yeah, a moving target, it, Dmitry Balyasny: It’s really important. So first, the overall philosophy, right? Like this is a slugging type of business, right? So if you, if you contrasted with like high frequency trading, which is a hit rate type of business, right? You’re gonna have 99% of your trades or whatever are gonna be profitable or a tiny loss, right? Right. But small profit, tiny, tiny, tiny, and repeat, repeat, repeat, right? Right. This is more of a slugging type of business. So if we have PMs and we have 170 investing teams at the moment, right? When you hire And so when you hire an investing team, chances are depending on their track record, maybe 75% of ’em will wind up working out. If they have a lower track record, they’re coming as like a former analyst making a transition to the pm Maybe it’ll be 50 50. But if you can control the risk, you might lose, you know, 10 million, 20 million, 30 million on somebody who doesn’t work out kind of life to date in their performance. But the ones that do work out, you’re increasing their capital, you’re growing their team, and they’ll hopefully be with you for 10, 20 plus years. And you might make, you know, hundreds and hundreds of millions off of them, right? So how that plays into risk, right? In order to enable the slugging, you have to have very well defined risk boxes within which people will operate to enable them to bet on the things that they’re really good at betting on, and try to exclude as much of the other stuff as possible. So for every strategy we’ll have, you know, stops, we’ll have vol targets, vol limits, we’ll have stress limits, liquidity limits, et cetera. And you create this box that’s completely transparent and in partnership with the portfolio manager that you’re hiring, and customize it and iterate it. And then as their strategy evolves and there’s new opportunities, you’re, you know, adding to it, subtracting from it all the time, et cetera. But the idea is to create this, this, you know, platform for them within which they can create like a very steady growing, you know, alpha stream that really plays to their individual strengths. Barry Ritholtz: You know, you mentioned market wizards at the beginning, and I can’t remember, I read all of them over the years, the first one a couple of times. I don’t remember which traitor it was, but the thing that stayed with me was it your win-loss record isn’t what matters. It’s how much do you lose when you lose relative to how much you’re gaining when you win? Exactly. And, and you could lose three quarters of the time if you’re losing a little bit. But the winners are big winners. Yeah. Net net, that’s a big win. Yeah. Dmitry Balyasny: We find our, it, it, it varies by strategies, but if you think about equities and equities, we find portfolio managers who have hit rates in the fifties with decent slugging could be very, very good, right? If somebody’s got a hit rate in the upper fifties with decent slugging, like that’s, you know, that’s an all star or somebody could be more like 50 50, but they have very good slugging, you know, that that works. It’s hard to find somebody with, you know, 25% hit rate and enough slugging to kind of overcome that. ’cause there’s just, there’s just too many reps, Barry Ritholtz: Too much churn. Dmitry Balyasny: But in some other strategies, if you have, you know, commodities for example, or a directional macro there, you can have like even a lower hit rate if they’re very good at sizing, right? Because they have a smaller number of bets at any given time and they’re trying to find like a few larger, bigger trades. Barry Ritholtz: Pyramid the winners ride the trends all the way out. Really interesting. Yeah. So you start the firm in 2001, really the beginning of a lost decade. We didn’t get back over prior highs in every asset class pretty much till 2013. What was it like launching right into the teeth of that.com collapse? Dmitry Balyasny: It was a great trading environment actually. So we, we did very well. At the time we were running a lot less capital. We started with $40 million. So, but the, the markets were less efficient. We were predominantly equity long short. There was a lot of dispersion, there was a lot of things that were unwinding from the bubble in both directions. We were able to take advantage of that and really grow the, grow the business. 00:16:53 [Speaker Changed] What was the biggest surprise to you in terms of the direction the business grew and evolved? 00:17:00 [Speaker Changed] I would say in those years, there wasn’t anything particularly surprising in, you know, 2008 we made people a little bit of money, but we had 50% redemption. So that was a bit surprising. Hmm. And not particularly pleasant. 00:17:17 [Speaker Changed] They people just, clients just panicked. Yeah. And said, I need liquidity. 00:17:20 [Speaker Changed] Well, because they need liquidity because, so we didn’t, we chose not to gate people, although we had the, the option in our docks, but we, we decided we were liquid and we actually went to cash in Q4 of, of oh eight. 00:17:30 [Speaker Changed] Did, did that cash come flying back in oh nine? 00:17:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it took a few years actually, but eventually, yes, eventually we got some credit for that. But 00:17:38 [Speaker Changed] If, if you’re positive in oh eight, what was oh eight down 37%, something like that. Yeah, 00:17:42 [Speaker Changed] We’re like 50 bucks or something. 00:17:43 [Speaker Changed] Oh really? That’s a win. Anything in the green is a win. That was 00:17:46 [Speaker Changed] A win. So that was surprising, but outside of that, it wasn’t anything too crazy. 00:17:51 [Speaker Changed] Coming up, we continue our conversation with Dmitri bni discussing what it was like building BNI asset management into a powerhouse. I’m Barry Riol, you listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Dmitri bni. He is the founder of asset management running about $28 billion in various strategies. And currently your title is Chief Investment Officer. How do you balance that role while simultaneously running a firm of 2300 employees? Well, 00:18:42 [Speaker Changed] I think number one, I have great partners and, and great management team, so that helps a lot. We have 20 partners today and a lot of top senior managements across all the departments. Besides that, I don’t think there’s a tremendous amount of different difference in the hedge fund business between being a CIO and a CEO. It’s kind of really commingled type of function because what are you doing as a CEO? Like you’re trying to figure out where to make money in the hedge fund, right? So that’s basically how I spend my time is like trying to optimize our investment strategies. And that really includes pretty much everything you need to do from a business standpoint. You know, how do you get the best people? Where do you have edge? How do you build your competitive mode around a strategy? How do you break in and wedge into a new strategy? And then how do you grow it from there again, that it’s gonna go down to finding the best people and enabling them to execute in that area. How do you support them with the best infrastructure and technology? So you have to work with all the departments to figure out how to, how to do that. So 00:19:49 [Speaker Changed] The, the one thing that continues to surprise me doing these interviews is how many people have said talent acquisition is absolutely the single most important thing. Yeah, they do. It sounds like you’re in that camp as well. 00:20:02 [Speaker Changed] Definitely. It all start, it all starts with talent, right? And the talent starts with why are they gonna come to you, right? Like, how are you gonna differentiate? And that was always kind of the starting point from 25 years ago. Because even at that time we were competing with firms that were, you know, 25 times our size, right? And so how are you gonna compete? And you’re not gonna write the largest check for somebody to show up, right? So you really gotta compete on enabling them to be the most successful over time, right? So that’s, you know, the insights, the collaboration across strategies, the culture that, that you can foster, helping them build their teams, helping them build the resources and infrastructure around them. Coaching, learning from other people’s mistakes, you know, having a very transparent environment. All these things that each individually might not be that important, but when you add them all up, it really makes the difference over the arc of somebody’s career. 00:20:57 [Speaker Changed] And, and to put a little flesh on those bones, ballet asne asset management has won numerous awards in terms of best places to work in money management, including taking the top award from pensions and investments, best places to work. How much of this is comp and how much of this is corporate culture beyond just the dollars? 00:21:21 [Speaker Changed] I think comp is always part of it. Like you certainly have to be competitive and you want to run a meritocracy. So the top people that are really driving the performance of the fund on the business side and the investing side should be super well compensated and have partnership opportunities. But besides that, I think the culture can lead to the performance, right? The culture is not just, it’s a nice place and people are nice to you, like that’s great, but if you have like a culture that’s really, you know, driven, but at the same time collaborative, right? And where people are collegial but they also push each other and they’re also constantly trying to figure out like better ways of doing things right. And wanna succeed themselves and be the best, but also they want the person next to them to succeed and make the firm better, right? Like if you can create that type of culture, like that really is one that high performers are gonna wanna work in and thrive at. 00:22:18 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting. So, so let’s talk a little bit about high performance. You operate a multi-strategy platform. When I hear multi-strat, I think fundamental equity, macro commodity slash futures trading arbitrage, systematic quant. Yep. You got it. Am I missing any that, that’s a nice list. 00:22:40 [Speaker Changed] No, those are, those are the major strategies. They all have lots of sub components. So you know, we have an arbitrage business for example, that will include, you know, converts and credit long, short and merger arbitrage and you know, a dozen different strategies, right? And commodities. We’ll have folks that are trading futures, directionally we’ll have folks that are doing a lot of RV type tradings. We’ll have physical commodities now that we’re building out. So all these strategies have lots of sub strategies associated with them, but generally that’s, you know, the right idea and you’re constantly trying to enable the next set of strategies, right? If you can execute well in the ones that you’re in this year, you have the option to figure out how to expand them, which might be more dollars in the stuff you’re doing well, but also what does that give you the right to compete? And that’s adjacent and we’re always trying to kind of figure out what is the next thing. 00:23:38 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. There was an article, I’m trying to remember which publication I saw it in that claimed you hired a trader with a $50 million pay package from a competitor. Is that remotely close to the sort of pay packages and how much does a trader have to generate in profits to qualify for a $50 million package? Sure. 00:24:01 [Speaker Changed] So you have to remember that the size of capital the folks are running these days has grown a lot. And so what publications like to do to get people to read the articles right, is put in large dollars as opposed to, you know, percentages, 00:24:15 [Speaker Changed] Denominator, blindness, they leave out Yeah. The context that it just looks like a big round number. 00:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So you have like these headlines all the time. One on how much people get paid to how much somebody made or lost. And you know, if you have something that says, you know, trader X, YZ lost, you know, $50 million, right? And that’s like, wow, that sounds like a giant number. But you have to remember we’re managing 28 billion, right? 00:24:37 [Speaker Changed] That’s a normal draw down in a bad 00:24:39 [Speaker Changed] Week. Yeah. I mean a typical portfolio manager right? Might be managing a couple billion in, in gross market value, right? Right. So, you know, that’s two point a half percent, which is not good, but it’s not, you know, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It’s not a disaster. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] No. Like that’s kind of the fluctuation that that, that you’re gonna get, right? And so from a hiring standpoint, it’s the same thing. If you’re hiring a, a trader with a $50 million pay package, for example, one that pay package is composed of lots of different things. It’s not all, it’s not just, you know, here’s 50 million 00:25:07 [Speaker Changed] Including his b and l for sure. Yeah. 00:25:09 [Speaker Changed] Like that includes, you know, it might include a guarantee for, for the time that the person is out of the market, it might include budget for hiring out their team, right? A lot of these teams are five 10 in some cases 15 people, so that’s expensive. Right? And it also might include extra upside incentives, which are only paid out if the person delivers a certain amount of p and l. So, you know, they kinda like print one number, but it, but it’s actually like lots of different components. Usually with that type of number, you’re budgeting that person to generate p and l of a hundred million plus a year. 00:25:46 [Speaker Changed] That’s a good investment vestment, 00:25:47 [Speaker Changed] We should have a track record of doing that. And if, and if you’re right on that, that leads to very healthy returns net to our investor, which, you know, we’ve delivered over time 00:25:56 [Speaker Changed] That that’s the game. Yeah. You have over 300 analysts and 170 PMs. How many different teams do you, are you guys running 170 PMs? Is that 170 specific strategies? So 00:26:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s 170 teams. So within the equities business for example, you’ll have like 70 teams, which sounds like a lot, but you have to remember that that’s split across, you know, three distinct equities businesses that all have like a different front end. And it’s also split across offices all over the world. And folks are, you know, based in London trading Europe based in Hong Kong or Singapore or Japan, you know, trading Asia. So it’s still fairly specialized. And each one of those teams will have a mandate where this is the group of stocks that they’re focused on in the case of equities, or this is the macro strategy in, you know, RV or emerging markets or rates or directional that they’re focused on in macro or you know, this person focused on, you know, trading gas or trading power and, and commodities. And they’ll build a team of subspecialists analysts around that. 00:27:03 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. So I mentioned earlier you’ve scaled up to $28 billion. Where does the general management strategy and style begin to get altered? Just by the size? At what point does that, we’ve seen a number of farms at a hundred, $200 billion and just the sheer heft becomes challenging. You can’t generate alpha at that scale, or at least not the same alpha. How large can this get comfortably? 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s hard to say. I think that’s a function of how markets develop over time. So if you have more companies, active capital markets, the world is growing, more places to trade in, you know, more credit instruments, more equity instruments, more macro instruments, then there’s, there’s kind of more to do. So if I think of the subset of strategies that we trade today, a lot of these things weren’t significant businesses, you know, 10 years ago or 20 years ago. So a strategy like merger arbitrage has been around a long time. A strategy like index rebalancing really got going the last 10, 15 years, right? You know, power trading in the commodities markets, right? Not a lot of people doing that 20 years ago. So a, a lot of these things go from very small strategies to much larger markets, you know, over time. And that enables you to run more vol there, you know, increasing your capacity. 00:28:33 The way that we go about it is every year and we update it throughout the year. We measure our capacity for, you know, this year and the following. And so we look at bottom up by each team, like how much can they grow at a steady pace? We don’t want people to grow too fast and we don’t want people to stay stagnant, right? Like you wanna find a healthy pace of growth as you’re expanding your coverage, as you’re getting used to running larger dollar amounts and dealing with those constraints. And we look at the recruiting. So where can we expand? Who is coming in? What does the pipeline kinda look like? You know, we discount that ’cause not everyone’s gonna work out, but you add those numbers together and that gives you a sense of what the growth path is likely to be. And over time that’s averaged about 20, 25% a year, you know, capacity growth. 00:29:23 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned you’re looking both internally and externally at recruiting. When you’re looking internally, how do you identify and nurture talents? How can you tell when, hey, this person started out as a trader or a pm but they really seem to have skills and can manage a larger group? Yeah. That, that seems like a really challenging thing to 00:29:43 [Speaker Changed] Do. We, we spend a lot of time on that and I think that’s one of the keys to how we’re gonna grow from here on out. Like recruiting is super important, but being able to develop your talent, I think as you have scale and you have more people to learn from, right? That becomes a bigger and bigger slice of your senior talent pool over time. So when we started off and, and for a long time, the vast majority of RPMs were recruited, you know, externally today, like inequities business, which is the most mature of our strategies, 25% in the US are internally promoted. And I wouldn’t be surprised if that was 50% in a, in a few years, right? Because now you have more senior PMs from up and coming analysts to learn from more programs that they can participate in to work their way up if that’s the path that they wanna choose. 00:30:40 Which, you know, that wasn’t available. You didn’t have the mentorship and the tools. So how do you help people and select, it’s both quantitative and qualitative. So on the quantitative side, we try to measure as much as we can. So we have data on people’s recommendations, right? Not just on the ultimate trades, but the data on their recommendations. And you see what is the performance and we track that, right? So you try to disaggregate the performance of the analyst from the PM and see if who’s driving value and if it’s a particular analyst who’s doing great, like we wanna make sure that person is getting more authority, more autonomy, and more leeway over time, right? More growth opportunities. And the best growth opportunity for them might be with the team that they’re on. They might be become a more senior analyst, they might become a partner on that portfolio, or they might raise their hand at some point and say like, Hey, I want to be a pm. 00:31:38 And we wanna make sure that we facilitate a path to that if we agree that they are talented. And part of that is in partnership with the PM that they’re working for. You don’t want the person to just leave and go somewhere else to take that opportunity. You wanna make sure that they replace themselves, they work in partnership with the pm maybe they co-run something for a period of time and then they have the opportunity to do their own thing. So it’s, it’s definitely a combination of those. And it’s the same thing on the business side. Like you’re always on the lookout for emerging business leaders who can manage others. And we have a, a lot of leadership development that we do and also us utilizing external coaches as well to help with that. 00:32:17 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s really interesting. External coaches, you mentioned mentorship. How important is mentorship for to the firm and how significant was it in your own professional journey? Well 00:32:29 [Speaker Changed] That’s where a partnership culture is really important, right? So I think it’s still fairly unusual in, in hedge funds, especially in our type of fund. And we’ve always wanted to build a true partnership where people own real equity in the business. You know, they buy in with their own money, they participate in all the economics of the business. And we have partners who are coming from the business side running a particular department. We have partners who are managers, heads of strategies on the investment side and we have portfolio managers. And so that dynamically creates like a culture where folks are incentivized to make the firm better, to make someone else better. And they’re obviously much more willing and excited to be mentors in those situations. And I think when you start with that, and I started with, you know, two of my co-founders, Scott and Taylor, you know, 20 plus years ago in a partnership type structure. And I think that then flows down through the organization. And so now today we have mentors for, you know, interns coming up, right? And you have mentors for, you know, younger associates in different areas of the firm. And then it goes, you know, all the way up and down the firm. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really 00:33:44 [Speaker Changed] Quite. And so for myself, sorry I didn’t answer that question. 00:33:46 [Speaker Changed] No, but you did. Yeah. Let’s hear about your own mentorship. 00:33:49 [Speaker Changed] I mean I certainly learned a lot from Steve Schofield working, working with him at the time, and got really good opportunities there. I think at a young age it was more, you know, certainly work ethic from, from my folks and then it was a lot from sports, right? I did a lot of, you know, basketball and you know, TaeKwonDo and things like that and seeing kinda what was possible. Like I remember as a kid, like watching TaeKwonDo demonstration where our instructor master shim, it was like a very slight Korean guy. It was probably, I don’t know, 140, 130 pounds. And he punched through a stack of seven cinder blocks punched through and you know, seeing that as a kid, you and I went to like examine the bricks after he did that and like tried to punch it and I was like, wow, that, you know, that hurt. And just seeing that just kind of shows you kind of what’s possible because every day after practice you would see the guy sit there punching a lead slab, you know? Yeah. For, you know, I don’t know, 30 minutes. Wow. Right. And it just adds up over time. 00:34:58 [Speaker Changed] Reminds me of the demonstration, this how old I am Bruce Lee did with the one inch punch. Yeah. Do you recall that? 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I was just showing that to my kids the other day. 00:35:06 [Speaker Changed] Ju-just an inch and he’s also Yeah, 40 something fly, soaking wet, one 40 and Right. It’s amazing the focus and power that you can create in such a small 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] That’s exactly the thing. It’s, it’s focus and perseverance. Right? 00:35:22 [Speaker Changed] Really quite, quite fascinating. So let’s talk a little bit about the current environment. I was kind of fascinated by something you told your team, you guys are trading too much and not investing enough. Explain. 00:35:39 [Speaker Changed] I think one of the keys to enduring success in the money management business is finding a balance between trading and investing, right? And you have to be true to your DNA and obviously the type of firm that that you’re at, right? But within each type of firm and each type of strategy, there’s always this, you know, tension, right? Because you can’t survive in a hedge fund type model, you know, just being a long term investor and you can’t really scale in a significant growing hedge fund being just a super active trader, right? So you need some combination of the two. And so what we try to do both at the individual level and at the strategy level is help folks find that balance. Part of it’s just seeing what’s working and part of it is a lot of statistical analysis that we do on each of the, each of the teams. 00:36:46 So when I made that comment, we were coming out of a period where I noticed that folks are really trading a little bit too much in the fundamental, you know, equities business and we’re like a little bit overly focused on each data point or we’re kind of missing the forest from the trees, right? And we were chopping ourselves up a little bit too much, missing some of the bigger winners and creating a lot of trading slippage costs. So we really worked hard with the teams to find more balance with that. Like find some positions that you can really be a longer term investor in. It doesn’t have to be, you know, years and years, but it could be, you know, months and quarters and supposed to days to weeks and find investments where there’s multiple ways to win where you’re not playing for one particular data point, you’re playing for a whole series of data points that’s gonna revalue you know, that security over time. And that’s been, you know, very, very effective I would say. 00:37:46 [Speaker Changed] So how much of this is a function of the environment that we all find ourselves in at any given moment? 22 was a double digit down year for stocks and bonds, but it was followed by 23 and 24 both years back to back plus 25%. Yeah. At least for US equities. Yeah. If, if you’re shortening up your investing timeline in a plus 25% year, is it just as simple as, hey, you’re leaving too much money on the table by trading? Well, 00:38:16 [Speaker Changed] For us it’s a little bit different because we’re running pretty much market neutral and in almost all the strategies. So if you’re running market neutral, whether the market’s up 25 or down 25, like you’re always gonna have half your portfolio that’s losing money on a, on an absolute basis. But you’re trying Yeah, but you’re trying to make the spread, right? Like you’re trying to make the the spread between your lungs and, and your shorts, right? So what influences are trading more than the absolute direction of the market is the volatility in the market. So if you’re in a period that’s very high vol, you’re naturally gonna be trading more to manage your risk and also because you’re getting stopped on things or they’re hitting your targets like fairly quickly. And high vol is associated with, with fundamental events like changing very quickly 00:39:01 [Speaker Changed] 20, 22, 500 base points 00:39:03 [Speaker Changed] Of fed hikes. Yeah. Or like the spring. So you, you, you, you’re gonna trade more during those April 00:39:06 [Speaker Changed] Of 00:39:06 [Speaker Changed] 2025 Exactly. Versus periods where things are sort of slowly, you know, trending and that’s okay, but over the course of the year, right, those periods are gonna balance out. Some will be vol, some will be lower vault. You want to find like the right amount of turnover to where you can capture your alpha, capture those relative mispricings and move on to the next thing that generate a strong sharp combined with like enough capacity, right? You can have a very high sharp and low capacity that doesn’t really help in a a scale, you know, hedge fund, right? You can’t eat your sharp, but you need enough sharp to be consistent putting up a p and l that kind of matters for the firm, that matters for the team that you’re running. And so for every strategy, like we try to come up with like what is a reasonable range, right? And that might be higher for, you know, a tech portfolio manager than, you know, utilities portfolio manager, right? But each of them should have a range that sort of is optimum for their style and we try to help them, you know, find that. 00:40:10 [Speaker Changed] So with the benefit of hindsight, I’m looking back at 2024, a fairly low vol year, Hey, maybe we should be trading a little less and holding a little longer and then 2025 volume spiked and at the end of Q1 and into Q2, all right, you guys can chop it up a little more. Is it just that simple or 00:40:29 [Speaker Changed] Yes. But again, I would say the more nuanced answer would be there’s lots of different types of trades that each person does. And you don’t want any pm doesn’t want their portfolio to just be one type of trade, right? So you might have short term trades, medium term trades, long term trades, right? Structural trades, tactical trades, risk mitigation, trades, et cetera. There’s lots of different types of trades and people run into problems when they get too focused on one kind of thing, right? And then when that thing is no longer working, it’s very hard to then reinvent yourself ’cause you don’t have any other, you know, irons in the fire, right? So again, we’re trying to run a lot of analysis and find like, what is the team really good at? Make sure that’s being expressed in the portfolio. Make sure there’s enough balance of different types of trades and that they’re not betting on things that they don’t really have views on that can take them out of the game before the things they do have views on payoff. 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Coming up, we continue our conversation with Dmitri bni, co-founder of BNI Asset Management, discussing the current market environment for trading. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in business on Bloomberg Radio, and some of you are watching this on YouTube. My extra special guest this week is Dmitri bni. He is the co-founder of BNI Asset Management, a multi-strategy hedge fund running over $28 billion. Do the different teams hedge their own positions or is that a function of firm-wide risk management and, and somebody else? 00:42:28 [Speaker Changed] We do both. So each team is responsible for running within their risk parameters. So they’ll have, you know, in the case of of the long short portfolio manager, they’ll have a idio risk, right? How much of your risk is outside of factor risk, right? And that should be, you know, 60, 70, 80% of your risk depending on the portfolio and the, and the style of the pm. But it’s basically the vast majority of somebody’s risk is their stock picking alpha, right? And depending on their skill and things like picking the right industry or trading the directionality of the market around, we might give them some more room or less room. You know, to do that, if you’re a directional macro trader, you’re gonna have, you’re not gonna have that constraint because you’re paid to directionally bet on the market, right? But you’re gonna have other limits like stress limits, right? 00:43:19 So if your directional bets don’t work out and there’s a gap tomorrow, you know, how much are you gonna lose in a stress scenario? So you have to, if that number is too high versus the agreed upon risk limits, you have to do something in your portfolio to hedge, you know, that that risk, right? So it’s a little bit different for each type of strategy, but the common philosophy is you wanna be able to run it to maximize your return while staying in the game, right? And delivering a relatively steady source of alpha over time. 00:43:53 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s interesting because they’re called hedge funds, but many hedge funds don’t hedge. And it sounds like BNY really makes an effort to make sure that as a risk management approach, anything that’s potentially downside, as you said, a gap has to be hedged. Yeah, 00:44:12 [Speaker Changed] I mean you’re looking for ab consistent absolute returns. So how do you get that right? You need specialists who have an edge in a particular strategy, right? And they need a portfolio construction or risk management approach that maximizes that edge, maximizes the capacity of dollars they can earn off of those advantages that they have, and minimizing the things that can create large drawdowns that they don’t really have, you know, edge and betting on. And so that’s the analysis that you’re constantly running and iterating on with the teams. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] So I heard a, a fund manager say, we have no competition because none of us in our space have market share. For the most part, we’re all less than 1% market share. How do you look at the competitive environment for other multi-strat firms? It seems like animal up and you get a decent number, but there are, what are there 11,000 hedge funds? 00:45:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The way we think about it is we’re not really competing with 11,000 hedge funds. So I think what you’ve seen over the last, you know, 20 plus years is a consistent market share gain from the larger platform firms, right? And now I think there’s really like four or five that, right? And if you look at the private equity industry, it’s pretty similar. Like there’s probably more than 10,000 private equity funds, but the vast majority of dollars, vast majority of alpha, the vast majority of people are really at, you know, half a dozen 00:45:47 [Speaker Changed] Fathead long tail. 00:45:49 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So the hedge fund industry’s really headed in that same, you know, direction. So we really compete with, you know, half a dozen firms. And now there’s also competition from some of the high frequency firms that are kind of going upstream to some of the longer duration discretionary strategies. And, you know, we’re doing more quantitative stuff going the other way, right? So maybe there’s a couple more, but you’re really competing with half a dozen to a dozen firms that are running, you know, specialist strategies at scale. And then everyone else in those strategies you kinda look at as like a generalist, you know, participant. And it’s great to have generalist participation. We want as much as possible from, you know, retail, from other funds, from, you know, prop, from banks. Like, like the more liquidity there is, the more generous participation there is. You know, I think the better for specialized firms. 00:46:39 [Speaker Changed] So the current environment kind of hard to compare to any other era. On the one hand we had a fairly robust economy coming into 2025 following a whole bunch of fed hikes. Now we’re expected to resume fed cutting by the time this airs. Were probably 25 paces points lower than where we are today. The whole tariff start stop. And now back to the litigation the Supreme Court agreed to take to that, it looks like inflation is starting to percolate a little bit as the labor market seems to soften. How does the firm look at all of these macro cross currents? Are they significant or are they just background noise or somewhere in between? Well, 00:47:23 [Speaker Changed] I would just say it’s a really interesting fluid environment, particularly for, for macro and, and long short equities because there’s just so much change. So if, if you think about like what is the worst environment to be in? It’s not when everything is clear. Because when everything is clear, there’s like no volatility, there’s no change, right? It’s hard to get any dispersion. So that environment might be good for passive strategies, but not, not good. 00:47:51 [Speaker Changed] Sideways markets don’t really help. 00:47:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. So now there’s a ton of money sloshing around trying to figure things out. And that’s a, that’s a great environment, right? So if you think about this here on the macro perspective, right? You went from a very, you know, positive view in January of how everything was gonna play out to, you know, kind of the tariff mess and very pessimistic view of how, you know, the US was gonna play out and, and what was gonna happen with markets we’re down 20% in the s and p briefly, and now you’re, you know, right back up and still, like a lot of things kinda swirling around as to how it’s gonna play out. To your point on rates and inflation’s been a lot of change. It’s created a lot of relative value opportunities as you get different hiking cycles, different cutting cycles and in different markets, like that’s great for macro in equity land, you have all the changes, not just from the economy but from AI and how that’s impacting tech, but also impacting companies that are customers or gonna be run over because of ai. Like creates great long short opportunities. So I think it’s a really fascinating market. I don’t have any giant, you know, prediction of how things are gonna, you know, play out tomorrow. But if you have strong teams who are on top of the latest data points and you can figure it out a little bit ahead of the next person. Just tremendous opportunities. Like this last week, Oracle report a quarter, you know, giant company. Crazy 00:49:18 [Speaker Changed] 37%, right? For for a giant, 00:49:20 [Speaker Changed] Giant company, 00:49:21 [Speaker Changed] Right? Giant company. Amazing. 00:49:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, when was the last time, you know, a company like that moved 35, 37, 7 00:49:26 [Speaker Changed] Unbeliev quarter, unbelievable, right? the.com collapse and it was in the wrong direction. 00:49:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, amazing, right? So if you could figure that out or, you know, I think a, some of these, you know, FinTech companies circle went public, right? Usually public offerings are like pretty efficiently priced, you know, this one goes up 400% after it starts trading, right? And then it goes down 50%, you know, and a month after that. So in the first three months, like think of the travel and the stock. So amazing opportunities, right? If, if your teams can figure that out. So, you know, we’re out there working hard doing the research and you know, figuring out the market. 00:49:59 [Speaker Changed] So it doesn’t sound like you think the AI theme is overdone, but it certainly is creating a little more volatility and a little more opportunities. 00:50:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I think the reality when we look back, you know, in 10 years or in 20 years in the actual outcomes that have happened, it’s probably under hyped really in terms of the stock re of the stock prices across the board. Like that’s harder to say. Like there’s some that are probably way over hype. There’s some that’re probably under a lot of companies have moved from one bucket to another where they were in a loser bucket and actually they turns out maybe they’re a winner or vice versa, where people got too optimistic and maybe they don’t really have anything that’s defensible and differentiated. So I think there’s a lot of alpha to be gained in figuring that out. And it’s hard to find things that are, you know, super bargain priced that have anything to do with ai. But in terms of like the longer term potential to really transform how people work and how companies work, I, I, I think it’s probably under hyped. I, 00:51:04 [Speaker Changed] I I, I’ve been fond of, of thinking of this in terms of, hey, the magnificent sevens certainly have been overhyped, but the magnificent 4 93 people haven’t really been paying attention to 00:51:17 [Speaker Changed] That. Well, yeah, I mean, it’s a good question. Like have they been overhyped, right? If you look at the dollars in earnings and cash flow that they’re generating pretty impressive in the market caps that they’re growing. Like I think they’re, you know, executing amazingly, amazingly well. I think it’s quite different from what we had in the, in the.com era where companies weren’t really making, making money. So that’s one difference. The other 4 93, I think there’s a lot of, you know, headwinds and tailwinds. So some companies are gonna figure it out, right? And they’re gonna kind of make the leap into the future and figure out how to be much more efficient. And you’re starting to see that in some of the commentary on the earnings calls where margins inflect positively for, you know, the way that they figured out how to leverage the tech and others are gonna disappear, right? So I think it’s gonna create a lot of opportunities. 00:52:10 [Speaker Changed] So the trader in me sees, we’re recording this on the 15th, another set of all time highs. I always learned on the desk, all time highs are bullish. What, what’s your perspective on all time highs? 00:52:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I think like you have this two-tiered market that you mentioned where you have the kind of tech leaders and, and the AI leaders and, and everything else, everything else. Companies definitely got hurt more with all the tariff ups and downs or, and inflation ups and downs earlier this year. That seems to be certainly calming down. And the partially, you know, top down as calming down and partially bottom up, companies are figuring out, you know, how to navigate these things and maybe it’s not as, as troublesome as they thought. And so you’re seeing like better execution and probably a little bit more po positivity from companies than you were seeing, you know, certainly six months ago. And that’s starting to get reflected and the market’s broadening out a little bit. But, you know, the largest, you know, tech companies certainly have, you know, tremendous advantages that they’re continuing to press. 00:53:24 [Speaker Changed] So last of our regular questions, what are traders and investors not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, geography, policy, data points, what’s getting overlooked but shouldn’t, 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] I think it’s, I don’t know if it’s getting overlooked, but I would say when you think about ai, where it’s going, what are the ramifications for every type of company, right? So at the moment, while AI is making us much more productive and efficient, we haven’t let go of one person because AI has automated their job, right? Like, we’re just hiring more AI people, right? But if you look out, you know, five years from now, is that still gonna be the case? You know, probably not, right? Like some jobs are gonna get automated, right? And, you know, we’re kind of on the, you know, high end I would say of, you know, skills that are necessary to, to work at a leading hedge fund. If you think of like a typical company where there’s a lot of folks doing like very bureaucratic type of things, like a lot of pretty mundane tasks, like all that stuff is gonna be automated. I don’t know if it’s in a year or in five years, like, but somewhere in that timeframe it’s gonna be automated. So when you think about 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Starting to SeeThrough, we started with the entry level jobs. Yeah. Under 30 unemployment is like 9.9%. Yeah. Double regular unemployment. 00:54:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. And so as, as you think about that, like what does that mean for every type of company, right? If you, if you’re a company that can really harness that and you could produce your products, your services at a much lower price point, and you figure that out ahead of the competition, like your margins might explode to the upside. On the other hand, if everybody in your space is doing that, like maybe your margins are actually gonna collapse, right? Because everybody’s gonna drive down pricing. And then how does it flow downstream? Like do you need as much office space if you’re gonna have less people in a particular area, right? So like all these kind of things, I think everyone is focused because there is a lot of volatility. Everyone is focused very much on like the next quarter. But if you think out, you know, 2, 3, 4 years, like how’s this space gonna look? Right? And that’s kind of the balance of trading and investing the work. You know, you gotta have one eye on each. 00:55:33 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. And, and before I get to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests, I have to ask you about some of the philanthropy you participate in. Tell us a little bit about the Atlas Fellowship and some of the other things that you’ve been doing over the past couple years. 00:55:49 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So this was a, a, a program that my wife Rebecca and I started, I think this is five years ago now. We were looking to start an initiative to help kids go to college who were a bit under resourced, maybe first in their family to go to college, et cetera. And as we’re looking at these scholarship opportunities, particularly in finance, we couldn’t find any program that had a combination of internships with scholarships. There were some that had ones that were captive to a particular company, but then you were, you know, beholden to work just at that company forever. But there wasn’t anything that was diverse, right. Where someone could get real exposure across the industry. And so that’s what we started with, with Atlas Fellows, where we give kids who are super bright, driven, merit-based scholarships. Right? So these are like top students in the class a lot of times from diverse backgrounds, from with no connections to finance. Right. And they get scholarships of up to 20 grand a year for four years. And in addition to that, they get fully paid internships at finance firms for all four 00:56:59 [Speaker Changed] Years. Not just your firm, but a Exactly. A broad variety. 00:57:02 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. So we take ’em, their, their first internship when they’re coming outta high school, and that one is typically done at BAM. And they work either on our investing teams, our data teams, our tech teams, our business teams. And then the next year they go to work at a bank, or they go to work at another hedge fund, or they go to work at a prop firm or a VC firm. And every year they, they rotate. And we just had the first cohort graduate last year. They all got jobs in finance, some in Chicago, some in New York. And employers are really competing over the kids. Like they’re super smart, driven, passionate kids. And now they’ve had four years of finance internships at top firms. So I, I think it’s working really well and we’re working to, to scale it 00:57:43 [Speaker Changed] Up. They, they become a hot, hot commodity. Yeah, 00:57:46 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. And just like the fun, like now we got a hundred kids in the program and, and we’re trying to really scale it up to hundreds. Wow. 00:57:51 [Speaker Changed] That’s great. Alright, so let’s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Starting with, we talked about mentorship at bam. Let’s talk about who were your mentors, who shaped your career? You mentioned Steve Schoenfeld, he had to be significant. Tell us about him and anybody else that made a 00:58:10 [Speaker Changed] Difference. Sure. Yeah. I, I think what, what Steven did really well at the time in the firm was it was a super entrepreneurial type of environment. Everyone was kind of in, in business running your own little business, right? And most folks kind of stayed as one man shops, right? As a one man trading unit, right? But I had the oppor opportunity to kind of build that into a unit of, you know, five and then 10, and then 20, and then 30. And then, you know, then we spun off. So just the, the freedom and support, you know, to, to do that was really helpful. Right? And then a lot of business learnings from, you know, seeing how we allocated to different people, seeing how they manage risk. Like that was very, you know, very helpful. And then philosophically, I would say the biggest impact was reading Atla Shrugged in College, which I read in a English class in, in college. And that really kind of articulated a, a moral, you know, philosophical framework around which I think it makes it much easier to build a successful business. Right? 00:59:21 [Speaker Changed] He hence the name Atlas. 00:59:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. The name of our fund and the name of, you know, our, our scholarship program. I think a lot of times people have all sorts of conflicts with, you know, being successful and at the same time, you know, being a good person and, and helping the world. And I don’t actually think there’s any conflicts. And that objective is philosophy in her work. Like really does a good job of laying that scaffolding for people. And I think it makes it, you know, much more fulfilling and less conflicted to also be, be successful in all realms. 00:59:59 [Speaker Changed] So since you mentioned Atlas Shrugged, let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:00:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that, that’s definitely the number one. The current one that’s on my bookshelf is a fun one. It’s from this explorer. I didn’t know there were explorers anymore, but there are apparently, and we had this guy Mike Horn, at our VC conference. We do like a public private VC conference every year called Elevate. And we had him as a guest speaker. And we, we had two guest speakers this year. We had Steve Kerr, the coach of the Warriors, and we had Mike Horn and Steve went first and he was amazing and a great, you know, stories on teamwork and, and collaboration and work ethic and Michael Jordan’s stories and stuff, currency stories. So it was great. And then Mike had to follow him and I was like, oh my God, how is this guy gonna follow us? It’s a follow, it’s a follow, right? And my partner Scott brought him, brought him on and, and Scott’s created finding like talent that’s, you know, other folks haven’t discovered yet. 01:00:56 And this guy, you know, has circumvented the equator several times around the world. You know, self-powered walking, et cetera. He’s gone to North Pole, south Pole, swam to Amazon, like all these, you know, insane stories. One after another. And he’s, he’s got a book called, I think it’s called Nothing is Impossible, or something along those lines. And you started like, you shake hands with this guy, and he’s not like a particularly big guy, but he like crushed my hand and I go, Mike, how do you get? And he’s 60 years old, how do you get this handshake? Oh my God. He’s like, well I, you know, kite surfed across the Antarctica and that involves, you know, holding a kite across, you know, frozen Antarctica for 14 hours a day as this huge wind is pulling you along. And it’s like, okay, that’s, that’s how you get 01:01:43 [Speaker Changed] Builds up a little grip 01:01:44 [Speaker Changed] Strength. That’s how you get some grip strength. Yeah. But he had like these amazing survival stories and just mental fortitude stories that I think really relate to trading and investing. So he was an awesome speaker. And so I just got his book. 01:01:58 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Have you ever read Endurance the Shackleton story? 01:02:01 [Speaker Changed] Yes, yes. I read it, watched the movie. That one was hard to sit through. 01:02:05 [Speaker Changed] The book is just, yeah. Like it couldn’t be fiction ’cause nothing is believed. Yeah. It’s so amazing. It had to be real. Yeah. 01:02:12 [Speaker Changed] This is along those lines, but less abusive and much more fun. 01:02:16 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about streaming. Anything interesting that you’re watching or listening to these days? 01:02:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, shows I like, I I really enjoyed the Three Body Problem, those on Netflix. That was a fun one. And then 01:02:27 [Speaker Changed] Books, the book is a tough slog. 01:02:28 [Speaker Changed] I read the book actually afterwards, 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] So it’s a little challenging. It’s a, because it’s originally in Chinese Yeah. Chinese and Transit book. But the show is really, the 01:02:36 [Speaker Changed] Show is really good. And, and the, and the books, the books like the creativity in the books are really fun. Mm. So that was a good one. You know, Yellowstone is great. So the usual ones there on listening to, I think podcasts are like the greatest invention in the last, you know, five, 10 years of, of, not that they weren’t around before, but like popularized in terms of being able to just expand your, your knowledge set in a very efficient way. So I try to listen to as many as I can. I, I listen to, you know, a lot of yours, I listen to a lot of Tim Ferriss’. He’s got all sorts of super interesting people on there that invest like the best ones. There’s a ton on there. So there’s a lot of finance ones, there’s a lot of VC ones I enjoy. I was just listening to one. They had Vinod Kla and then another one with Mark Andreessen, and they’re just like, super thought provoking. And so I, I encourage like all our young people coming up that, that ask just, you know, you have this like amazing resource you could tap, you know, Spotify and, and you got, you know, a thousand different podcasts from World’s Best people in every field that you can listen to sharing their insights. 01:03:37 [Speaker Changed] There’s no excuse to be bored these 01:03:39 [Speaker Changed] Days. No, it’s amazing. I remember when I was coming up and I wanted to hear like, how do hedge funds make money? Right? Like, you couldn’t figure that out. Like if you had no connectivity to a hedge fund. Like how are you gonna figure that out? You read Market Wizards and now what? Right. But besides, besides that, reading all the books that are available now, like the podcast, like amazing resource. 01:03:58 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either trading, investing, multi-Strat hedge funds? 01:04:09 [Speaker Changed] I mean, one is just follow your curiosity, which hopefully leads to a passion of something that you wanna really do, right? Don’t go into finance, hedge funds, whatever it is, because your, your friend is making a lot of money, right? Like, you gotta be interested in the work. Like you gotta be driven and curious and hopefully passionate about what it is that you’re doing because, you know, it’s like pro sports or anything else. Like, just because you know LeBron makes a lot of money doesn’t mean you’re gonna go make a lot of money playing basketball, right? You know, one, you know, he’s six 11, but besides that, like, he’s put in a lot of work over the years, right? And it’s because he loves the game of basketball, right? If you don’t love it, you’re not gonna put in the work and in trading for sure, if you’re, if you don’t love the process and you don’t love sitting there looking at the screen and trying to figure things out, you’re not gonna survive the emotional ups and downs. 01:05:06 ’cause there’s lots of downs in addition to the ups when things work out. So that’s the first thing. The second thing I would say is go to a firm that’s growing, right? And where there’s a culture that where you can learn from others, right? Where you can get good mentorship, there’s top people you can learn from, and you’ll have some amount of access to be able to, to do that. The particular thing that they’re trading or investing or how they’re doing it, the, like, that’s a lot less important. ’cause you, you might change, the company might change. And then the third thing is like, once you’re in a seat, that’s a decent seat, you know, ask for feedback. Like, here’s what I did, here’s what I think I could have done. You know, what do you think? Right? Don’t ask for feedback when the market opens or the person’s like in the middle of a, you know, disastrous day. But when things are quiet, right? Early, late, right lunch hour, like, you know, get, get feedback proactively, right? Don’t sit around waiting for your year end review to see how things are going and, you know, iterate it together with, you know, the people that you’re working with. 01:06:13 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of capital markets trading, investing today that would’ve been useful in 1994 when you were first starting out? 01:06:23 [Speaker Changed] I think the things that we’ve been doing the last, you know, five years, I wish I had figured those out earlier. So investing more aggressively across strategies, right? I think we were too equity heavy for too long. We weren’t serious enough about how do you build those strategies outside of equities and not serious enough about hiring top people to manage those areas. And then building like all the tech and the infrastructure that you needed to really be competitive and leading in those areas. So I wish I would’ve figured that out a little bit, a little bit earlier and pushed at it harder. But I think it’s on the, on the right trajectory now. 01:07:13 [Speaker Changed] Dmitri, thank you for being so generous with your time. This has been absolutely fascinating.

Title: Grab Stock To $4?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Grab Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRAB), Southeast Asia’s foremost super-app for ride-hailing, deliveries, and digital payments, has experienced a surge in 2025, rising approximately 30% year-to-date to around $6.25 per share. However, as investors ponder whether the stock could double, there is another equally significant question: could Grab’s upward momentum diminish and the stock dip back down towards $4? Let’s delve into the argument. If you are searching for upside potential with reduced volatility compared to owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—which is a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns surpassing 91% since its launch. In addition, check out – The Roller Coaster Ride Of Opendoor Stock? Grab reported a gross merchandise value (GMV) of $7.9 billion for 2024, with revenues totaling around $2.2 billion—representing a slower rate than during its early growth phase. While ride-hailing is on the mend, food delivery has moderated, and fintech remains a burden on profits. At a price of $6.25 per share, Grab trades at approximately 3.5x forward sales, which is below that of global competitors like Uber. Nonetheless, if revenue growth continues to float in the mid-single digits and margins stay exceedingly thin, investors may apply a stricter discount. A multiple nearer to 2x sales would suggest a share price close to $4, significantly lower than the current price. The essential insight: Grab doesn’t require a collapse to experience a decline. A slight disappointment in growth or profitability might be enough to recalibrate expectations. At $6.25 per share, Grab has staged a commendable rally in 2025, but the risk of a retraction persists. If growth continues to stabilize and fintech losses accumulate, the stock could regress back towards $4. On the other hand, stronger margin improvements and increased digital banking adoption could validate today’s valuation—or potentially elevate it further. For investors, Grab is still a narrative of substantial potential but also considerable execution risk. At $6.25, the stock reflects a recovery. At $4, it would hint at skepticism about the profitability of the super-app model. Its future trajectory will depend on Grab's ability to turn market dominance into sustainable earning strength. Investors should brace for considerable volatility and the chance of significant losses if market conditions worsen or if the company fails to realize its ambitious growth objectives. While the 2x upside potential is mathematically sound based on projected revenues, it necessitates flawless execution within a rapidly shifting and competitive environment. Now, we implement a risk assessment framework while structuring the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a strong history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks resulted in better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Did Reddit Stock Drop 10%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Reddit stock (NYSE:RDDT) dropped nearly 10% in the past week, in contrast to the nearly stable performance of the S&P 500 Index. The fluctuations in Reddit’s stock price are particularly notable when compared to its competitors, including Meta Platforms – which fell about 3% during the week, Snap – gaining around 8%, and Pinterest – which dropped approximately 3%. The decline is indicative of investor worries regarding slower user growth and possible traffic challenges related to updates in Google’s search algorithms and AI-generated responses, which may impact engagement and advertising capacity on the platform. With the current share price hovering around $237, we believe Reddit could experience short-term challenges before stabilizing. Importantly, the stock is still significantly higher compared to its IPO valuation from early 2024 and has increased by 45% since late 2024, as outlined in our analysis of Why Reddit Stock Moved. However, for those looking for growth with less volatility than owning a single stock, the High Quality Portfolio is worth considering. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark, which consists of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns of over 91% since its launch. As a whole, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, don’t miss – Uber Stock To $200? Some of the increase in Reddit’s stock since its IPO can be attributed to the approximately 30% rise in its revenues from 2022 to 2024. Revenue growth surged in 2023 due to the introduction of new ad products and licensing agreements, and this trend continued into 2024 with ongoing growth in advertising and AI-related data licensing. Nevertheless, growth started to slow somewhat in early 2025 amid worries regarding traffic sources and user engagement patterns. Although Reddit has experienced steady revenue growth, its PS multiple has not broadened significantly. The company's PS multiple rose from around 10x in 2024 to almost 12x by mid-2025. While the company’s PS is currently above historical averages, there may be potential downside when comparing the current multiple to previous peaks – roughly 15x in late 2024 and closer to 9x as recently as early 2023. In its latest quarter, Reddit declared revenue of approximately $240 million, reflecting an increase of more than 20% year-over-year, and recorded its second quarterly profit since its IPO. However, the daily active users count of 100 million was slightly under optimistic forecasts, raising concerns about market saturation and competition. For the full year of 2025, Reddit has projected revenue growth in the mid-20% range, but remarks regarding traffic uncertainty have made investors cautious. If the company can demonstrate resilience in user engagement and continue to enhance its ad products, the stock could potentially regain its upward trajectory. However, in the short term, volatility is expected to remain as investors weigh high valuation multiples against execution risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark inclusive of all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap — and has generated returns above 91% since its inception. What accounts for this success? As a collective, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio deliver better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: War on Labor Accelerates: Administration Predictably Embraces Guest Workers and “Anti-Capitalism” Is Labeled Terrorism

This is Naked Capitalism fundraising week. 291 donors have already invested in our efforts to combat corruption and predatory conduct, particularly in the financial realm. Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal. Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting the comments section. While the Trump administration’s recent $100,000 fee for H1-B visas have received the lion’s share of the attention due to potential effects in the tech and healthcare fields, there was a recent policy change for lowly agricultural guest workers that shows how the administration’s immigrant worker plan is coming full circle. As we predicted, after targeting humanitarian parole, temporary protected status, and other immigrant workers, the administration is now relaxing rules for H2-A “guest workers,” a program which has been called “close to slavery.” Back in July, the administration put in place stringent in-person interview requirements for a wide range of visa holders and applicants. Only two months later, they are lifting the requirement for guest agricultural workers. Now, this could simply be an admission of error by the administration which is getting complaints about crops rotting and realizing it made a mistake. It’s more likely this was the plan as it’s what workers have been warning against and such a move fits with Trump’s priors. Are H2-B workers—those “guest” laborers in non-agricultural fields that Trump’s businesses rely on—next to be waved on in by the administration? That, too, looks increasingly likely. Key to understanding this mega project of workforce engineering by the administration is understanding who is being targeted by ICE, deported, and who is being waved into the US while others encounter roadblocks. Let’s take a look. Who Among the Immigrant Workforce Is Being Targeted for Removal About 40 percent of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented. Here’s how the makeup looks: As of 2020 there were more than 406,000 individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to reside and work legally in the US due to unsafe conditions in their home country—usually with an assist from US interference ala regime change efforts or direct military involvement. The similar humanitarian parole covered another 530,000-plus. According to FERN: Another 1.7 million people work in food processing plants, per the USDA. Many are refugees, and approximately 19% are in the country without authorization, according to the New American Economy research group. In the largest food processing segment, meatpacking, the American Immigration Council estimates that 45% of all workers are immigrants and around 23% are unauthorized. While the administration goes after the unauthorized, It is also trying to get rid of TPS and humanitarian parole. Trump suspended all refugee resettlement programs via executive order save for white South African “refugees.” The Department of Homeland Security also removed Afghanistan and Venezuela from the TPS list and is trying to axe Haiti as well. That means more than 9,000 Afghan, 300,000 Venezuelan, and 200,000 Haitians in the US can be legally deported. There is a heavy concentration of TPS holders in the meatpacking industry. As of 2020, roughly 15,600 worked on farms or in food processing.The United Food & Commercial Workers union warned months ago that deportations or threats of deporation could lead to the meat shortages and price increases that we currently seeing (although there are other factors). From Investigate Midwest: Increased immigration enforcement has scared many immigrants—legal or not– into staying home after the Supreme Court allowed ICE to target people based on skin color For example, in Beardstown, Illinois, many workers at the meat processing plant were legally in the U.S. under humanitarian parole programs, but the Trump administration revoked their status. At first the administration said it was going after people with criminal records rather than conduct mass workplace raids. But there was no way that path was going to get to the stated goal of 1 million deportations by the end of the year. And so food production sites became a prime target. Yes, these raids target unauthorized immigrants. They also set back the country’s food system. Designed to Fail Recall that the administration’s plan was based not only on getting rid of workers who had built lives in the US, many of whom were trying to improve their lot through unionization efforts, but also snatching Medicaid away from all the loafers out there. This was going to somehow magically get Americans out into the fields and into the slaughterhouses despite all the evidence to the contrary. Here’s Scott Morgenstern, a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has predicted that farm owners will soon find plenty of U.S. citizens to employ. She declared on July 8 that the new Medicaid work requirements included in the same legislative package as the immigration enforcement funds would encourage huge numbers of U.S. citizens to start working in the fields instead of losing their health insurance through that government program. Farm trade groups say this scenario is far-fetched. For one thing, most adults enrolled in the Medicaid program who can work already do. Many others are unable to do so due to disabilities or caregiving obligations. Few people enrolled in Medicaid live close enough to a farm to work at one, and even those who do aren’t capable of doing farmwork. When farm owners tried putting people enrolled in a welfare program to work in the fields in the 1990s, it failed. Another experiment in the 1960s, which deployed teenagers, didn’t pan out either because the teens found the work too hard. Notably one strategy not employed by the administration is requiring higher wages and improved worker conditions. And so unsurprisingly federal labor data shows a 7% drop in the US agriculture workforce between March and July, equal to roughly 155,000 workers. Predictably, the Trump administration is turning to H2-A guest workers. In June, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the creation of the Office of Immigration Policy, which the labor secretary said will be a “one-stop shop” to help employers meet their labor needs.. And then on September 18, the State Department declared that H2-A visa holders no long must attend an in-person interview to renew their visas within 12 months of the expiration of their old one. It wouldn’t be surprising if H2-B workers are next to be waved in, perhaps based on slaughterhouse worker shortages, but also beneficial for people like Trump who employs the guest workers at his properties. Industry “stakeholders” are applauding the H2-A move, and they are asking for more—particularly longer term work permits, which are still tied to an individual’s labor and mean the employer has near complete control over the worker. In effect what’s happening is a trading out of people for exploitable workers. In the tech world, the AI bubble might be an avalanche of slop, but is useful in another way. Take Amazon, which claimed AI was taking jobs when it conducted mass layoffs only to turn around and replace those workers with cheaper H1-B alternatives. In the case of the agriculture and service sector industries, we have the government doing the heavy lifting removing immigrants and refugeesn who aren’t exploitable enough and replacing them with H2-A and H2-B alternatives. Why Capital Loves Guest Workers A crucial difference between the migrant H-2B and H-2A workers and immigrants who live and work in the US under temporary protected status or humanitarian parole is that the latter two categories didn’t have their ability to stay in the country legally tied to their work. That made them less exploitable. They were free to change jobs and unionize. That’s probably a big reason they’re being targeted for deportation. Trump has suggested that unauthorized immigrants and refugees who had built lives in the US could potentially return legally, but the administration has not provided specifics. It’s pretty clear what he means. Edgar Franks, the political director of Familias Unidas, summed it up in April—an assessment that is now shared by the likes of the AFL-CIO’s Department of People Who Work for a Living and other unions: It was meant to silence the organizing, deport as many people as possible, and to bring in a captive workforce through the H-2A program. We think that might be the ultimate plan: to get rid of all the immigrant workers who are organizing and fighting back for better conditions, and to bring in a workforce that’s under the complete control of their employer with basically no rights. Franks prediction is steadily being realized. And to back up his claim, it’s pretty remarkable how efficiently ICE and the administration target unauthorized or refugee workers who are unionized or organizing. Some examples: The United Farm Workers labor union has condemned the raid at the farm that the UFW has been actively organizing in since 2022. Of the 14 workers detained at the May 2 raid, ten were ultimately deported. UFW Secretary Treasurer Armando Elenes labels the raids as “shameful employer complicity in the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate legal protections and lower wages for farm workers.” “A legally-binding union contract has already been awarded at Lynn-Ette by a NY State-appointed arbitrator, yet Lynn-Ette is defying the law and refusing to implement this union contract,” states Elenes. As of 2024 there were 384,900 H2-A and 215,217 H2-B workers in the US—numbers that have been steadily increasing for decades and especially over the past 15 years with a more than fivefold increase since 2010. With the administration’s early moves, this number is set to increase even further. In theory, the foreign workers who obtain H-2A visas are supposed to be guaranteed relatively high wages, as well as housing in the U.S. In reality, it is not enforced, and they are left to the whims of their employers. Because they are basically indentured servants they are loved by Trump and many employers. Even the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security “acknowledge that H-2B workers face structural disincentives to reporting or leaving abusive conditions, and often lack power to exercise their rights in the face of exploitative employment situations.” The Food & Environment Reporting Network with more: …these visas are notoriously abusive to foreign workers. That’s because they effectively create a captive workforce: In contrast to other immigrant workers in the U.S. — including recipients of certain humanitarian programs, like TPS — H-2 workers’ presence in the country is tied to a particular job and employer. H-2 employees are eligible to work for whoever sponsors their visa, and it can be prohibitively difficult for them to switch jobs even if they’re mistreated. If they quit, they’re sent back to their home countries, which would ruin many H-2 workers and their families financially. (Over half of all H-2A farmworkers enter the country in debt to illegal recruiters, who charge fees for connecting workers with job contracts.) H2-A guest workers also faced a major setback in their fight to organize last year when a District Court Judge issued an injunction in August that blocked them from unionizing in 17 states. The guest worker program also features labor trafficking, rampant wage fraud, illegal recruitment fees, wage theft, and illegal threats of retaliation. Abuse is made easy by the fact that it’s almost impossible for workers to quit their jobs since their visas are tied to a single employer. Mike Rios, a DOL regional agricultural enforcement coordinator, describes the H2 program as the “literal purchase of humans.” But it’s not just the guest workers who suffer. Pain (Nearly) All Around The guest worker program might be beneficial for individual employers, but it is drain for American society. From Investigate Midwest: Undocumented immigrants paid $100 billion in taxes in 2022, without enjoying any of the benefits, such as Social Security or Medicare. Living in communities, they also contribute to local economies. Temporary visa workers, on the other hand, send most of the money they earn to their home countries. It’s also bad for all workers, including those those Americans who were supposed to take the place of immigrants and refugees. The Food & Environment Reporting Network: H-2 workers have so little bargaining power that some employers prefer to hire them over U.S. citizens — which ends up disenfranchising the American-born workers Trump and Miller say their deportations will benefit. Under federal law, employers must show they were unable to hire American workers before they’re approved to hire H-2 workers, but some employers circumvent that rule and commit visa fraud to avoid hiring Americans at higher rates. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has filed a string of complaints with the DOL, alleging that meatpacking companies have repeatedly requested increased allocations of H-2B workers as a way of undercutting wages. What about all those workers who have lived and labored here for years and in some cases decades? There’s a reason that immigration question was never settled as described here by Michael Macher: …the US immigration system runs not on the enforcement of immigration laws, but on their selective nonenforcement. Employers have relied on the state to ignore the exploitation of undocumented labor while holding the credible threat of deportation over workers. This has had the effect of strengthening employer bargaining power generally against all workers—lowering wages, weakening unions, and shifting the politics of work away from collective bargaining and wage-and-hour regulation. The interest in labor that is weak and disorganized has driven US politicians, consciously or not, to adopt the role of petty bosses, threatening the deportation of significant portions of the US workforce. Trump might be in the process of blowing up that system by turning the role of petty bosses back to the actual bosses, and he’s able to do that now because labor is so weakened after a half century of losses in the class war. Even the crumbs are now being snatched away. Weak—and in some cases counterproductive from a labor viewpoint—agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are being further crippled. And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” That means that as of now any effort from workers and unions to fight back, such as “illegal” strikes, can now be labeled “anti-capitalist” and the weight of the police state will come crashing down on them. Public sector unions are already in retreat. Immigrants who were part of communities, and in many cases unions, are being shown the door only to be replaced by indentured servants often housed away from society in squalid prison-like housing. Trump is dutifully playing his role as an accelerant and looking to make a bad program worse: The Biden administration changed the methodology for calculating the rate for H-2A workers, which resulted in a larger pay increase for some of them this year. Some farm organizations, including the NCAE and the Farm Bureau, want the Trump administration to roll back that change and expand the H-2A program to cover year-round workers, especially for dairy and livestock farms. During Trump’s first term the temporary work visa programs steadily grew a total of 13 percent larger, and he used the Covid emergency to help make it happen: During the pandemic, his administration issued a series of emergency measures that made H-2A and H-2B visas more flexible and employer-friendly. Workers were allowed to stay in the country for longer periods of time, in part because they had been deemed “essential workers,” and wages for H-2A workers were effectively frozen. Trump 2.0 is using a crisis of its own creation in order to strengthen the guest worker program and hammer all of labor. Rather than better pay and working conditions to entice American workers, we’re getting an increase in guest workers to further drive down wages and worker protections. The house of labor, which has been burning for decades, is now being doused with Trump gasoline. And the capital-labor arrangement being steadily reinforced looks for Americans a lot like the immigrant experience. All workers must sell their labor for pennies on the dollar, accept unsafe conditions, and any other types of abuse or, in the case of immigrants, face deportation to foreign prisons. For Americans, the risk is becoming homeless and tossed into US (private) prisons. And with “anti-capitalist” beliefs now labeled as terrorism, workers face even more hurdles fighting back. Indentures and serfdom. Trump et al appear nostalgic for the days of proto-capitalism when the employer (lord of the manor) had near absolute power. It also brings to mind the Dickensian “dark satanic mill era” when wages were as close to starvation level as possible. But what is one to do? That’s capitalism in its purest form and who wants to be an Anti-capitalist in the US of A? Or maybe it’s just nostalgia for the Grapes of Wrath era which was less than 100 years ago. FDR may have sanded the rough edges off industrial capitalism but Big Ag has always had special power out in the heartland. And now we have Big Tech that also loves them some unskilled labor for their warehouses–picking products rather than vegetables. The solution to the immigration problem is simple. Employers should be required to pay foreign workers the same wages and benefits as American workers. Throughout history, immigrants have been welcomed not because ordinary citizens are tolerant but because capitalists have viewed them as a source of cheap labor. The H2a program has a higher wage floor built in – the adverse effect wage. Farms that employ H2a workers in my region often have higher pay than non-H2a employers. However, because farmers already feel like they are overpaying their guest workers, work and housing conditions suffer. B2S Workers want these jobs badly, and are willing to put up with a good amount of abuse in order to keep them, and given their lack of agency in the recruitment process, workers fear the next farm could be much worse. The Somalian and Cambodian refugees I have worked with have had the ability to quit and find new jobs. Not so for the Jamaican H2a workers. The importance of this factor in incentivizing farmers in improving work conditions cannot be overlooked. I await your silent empire, Tristero. Although in this curious instance, the foreigners were paid more. But the abusive conditions are present. Black Farmworkers Say They Lost Jobs to Foreigners Who Were Paid More (NY Times via archive.ph) From 2021 The reliance on South Africans may reflect the nature of agriculture and the demographics in the Mississippi Delta, compared with places like California. “In the Mississippi Delta, row-crop production requires fewer workers but workers who have skills to use machinery and equipment,” said Elizabeth Canales, an agricultural extension economist at Mississippi State University. “We hardly have any Latinos in this remote region. Naturally, it’s easier to hire South Africans where language will not be a barrier, especially because in this area, you have a very small Spanish-speaking population.” The South Africans arrived in the region willing to work weeks that sometimes stretched to 75 hours or more, grueling schedules that might have been difficult for older local workers to maintain, industry analysts said. “And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” Chris Hedges latest explains in detail what Trump’s directive will mean to you and me: https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/trumps-war-on-america A narrow slice of the H1-B program earns the ire of many. If jobs are narrowly posted so they are hidden from domestic workers and targeted toward foreign workers, there are some inequities. Domestic people get shafted, having to train their replacements, notoriously in IT, and foreigners may get jobs but at the costs noted of passport confiscation, abuse and other ills. Transparency would help. My opinion is that H-1B and Students were targeted because many become Pro Palestinian. May not even be Trump per say, but by those who control Congress Nip it in the bud as they say Thanks Conor! All the news is about ICE, harsh immigration crackdowns, and deportations to 3rd world hell holes. Very little news on H-2B visas, and virtually no news on H-2A visas, i.e. the real reason for the immigration crackdown. Labor organization, strikes, and any sort of anti capitalism protests are now considered gateway to terrorism activities that get you on a terrorism watchlist. Alligator Alcatraz and other US prison sites being built. Republican senators and members of congress silent and in hiding from their base. The Democrats have Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries leading their base in a silent and peaceful march into economic bondage. And the MAGA base continues to wear their “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” hats in blissful ignorance over the fact that they’ve been played bigtime. Only in America, the richest country ever, where the 1% still do not have enough to fill the bottomless pit in their collective souls, could this happen. Exactly why Democrat strategist Carville told the Party that playing possum would be hard, I imagine… when they “wake up” the daddy party will have gotten their own hands bloody with the troublesome left for the mommy party.

Full Content:
AI giant Anthropic is facing a possible head-on collision with the Trump administration — as concerns from conservatives multiply that the fast-growing firm carries a left-wing bias, The Post has learned. Investors in the San Francisco-based company — known for its popular Claude chatbot — include the Ford Foundation, a notoriously left-leaning group that bought $5 million worth of Anthropic shares in March 2024 in the bankruptcy of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, according to little-noticed court filings. Earlier this month, Vice President JD Vance called out the Ford Foundation by name while vowing to “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That’s after Anthropic recently irritated Trump officials by barring federal contractors from using its tools for some law enforcement purposes. Some at the White House have grumbled that Anthropic, whose CEO Dario Amodei is a prominent Democratic donor, could be “selectively enforcing its policies” due to differing political views, Semafor reported. Taken together, the two data points are likely to invite unwelcome scrutiny for Anthropic — even as rivals including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI have worked to curry favor with the White House, a source close to the Trump administration said. “When [the White House] is looking for a collaborative partner and suddenly they start being obstinate over White House objectives, and it comes to surface that they got a significant investment from a hostile political organization – which is what I would consider the Ford Foundation to be – I think you’re going to see a lot of eyebrows being raised,” the source added. Anthropic, whose backers include Amazon and Google, is competing with OpenAI, xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta for everything from lucrative federal contracts to crafting potential federal regulations around AI. But even before the latest flap over AI usage by federal contractors, Anthropic’s relationship with the White House – and key administration officials like AI czar David Sacks – was already seen as shaky at best. Anthropic’s Amodei called Trump a “feudal warlord” in a now-deleted social media post expressing support for Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. In 2018, he described Trump as a “serious and legitimate threat to the rule of law.” During a May episode of the popular “All In” podcast, Sacks said Anthropic was part of group of tech “doomers” that he described as “committed leftists” and “Trump haters” with ties to the effective altruism movement, which once counted Bankman-Fried among its elite backers. Sacks also pointed out that several ex-Biden administration staffers had joined Anthropic and that Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, a Democratic megadonor, was part of its board of directors. Amodei was one of the few tech honchos who skipped Trump’s inauguration in January, though he did attend an administration event about energy policy in Pittsburgh in July. He has also raised the hackles of some AI leaders with frequent warnings about the technology’s risks. Amodei has said executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur due to AI and suggested unemployment could hit 20%. He’s also warned of a 25% chance that things go “really, really badly” for humanity as AI gets more advanced. Daniela Amodei, his sister and a fellow co-founder of Anthropic, has a long history of donating to Democrats, include Harris, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. “When it comes to policy and trying to foment the golden age of American economic dominance, the White House is looking for partners who want to put America first and want to work together collaboratively,” the source close to the White House added. Despite its differences with the administration, Anthropic has secured a number of federal contracts – including a $200 million contract with the Department of War and a partnership with the US General Services Administration. Anthropic has also expressed support for the White House’s AI Action Plan, declaring it was “encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Anthropic’s valuation was just $18.4 billion in early 2024. But as of earlier this month, Anthropic had secured an $183 billion post-money valuation. Depending on the share structure, that means Ford Foundation’s stake, while tiny compared to key backers like Google and Amazon, has seen a huge increase in value over the last year. An Anthropic spokesperson said the Ford Foundation represents a small fraction of the firm’s overall investor base. Ford does not have any influence over Anthropic’s policy positions or business activities, the spokesperson added. “We are committed to protecting America’s lead in AI, defending and upholding America’s democratic values, and contesting the advance of authoritarian adversaries,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “As part of that commitment, Anthropic was an early mover in deploying AI for national security and intelligence work, and we work with the intelligence community in many different capacities.” The spokesperson also pushed back on the notion that Anthropic has a rift with the Trump administration. While Anthropic’s policies bar the use of its AI tools for “direct domestic surveillance and related collection of data,” multiple federal law enforcement agencies “are currently using Claude for research, analysis, and other use cases.” Other AI giants, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Google, have policies restricting use of their AI tools for surveillance purposes. A Ford Foundation spokesperson said: “Like any other passive investor in a company, the Ford Foundation has no role in Anthropic’s management or business activities.” Vance, who co-hosted an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” after the assassination, alleged that the Ford Foundation and the George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations had provided funding to progressive magazine The Nation. The vice president slammed the outlet for misrepresenting Kirk’s words in an article titled “Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning.” In response, Open Society said it never funded The Nation, while Ford Foundation said it hasn’t funded the outlet since 2019. The allegation was part of a larger pledge by Vance to target progressive groups that he accused of stoking a rise of left-wing violence. Advertisement

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Experiment is the only means of knowledge at our disposal. Everything else is poetry, imagination.”— Max Planck Number of the Week: Less than 10% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on the EPA Endangerment Finding by Richard Lindzen and William Happer. TWTW continues with a geological paper by Leszek Mark who asserts that the current warming is largely part of a natural cycle. Then TWTW discusses an assertion in the Wall Street Journal that human emissions of carbon dioxide have made the oceans too acidic to be considered healthy. ********************* EPA Endangerment Finding: On September 22, Richard Lindzen, Professor of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Emeritus, MIT, and William Happer, Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Princeton University, submitted their comments to Administrator Lee Zeldin of the US EPA on the reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. The highly accomplished forty-plus-page document is full of scientific evidence contradicting the Endangerment Finding. TWTW cannot adequately summarize it here but will cite some sections that may be of particular interest with the footnotes omitted. After thanking Administrator Zeldin for the opportunity to comment, the opening page states: We are career physicists with a special expertise in radiation physics, which describes how carbon dioxide and other GHGs affect heat flow in Earth’s atmosphere. We are both members of the National Academy of Sciences. Our CVs are attached. Our comment focuses on your request for comments as to, “The scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are weaker than previously believed and contradicted by empirical data, peer-reviewed studies, and scientific developments since 2009 (C-2).” In our scientific opinion, the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding (“EF”) are fatally flawed science, for two key reasons. • It fails to consider contradictory science. • It is not based on science; it is based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Scientific details follow.” After giving a table of contents, the Introduction states: “The EPA Endangerment Finding is: ‘[T]he Administrator finds that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare. Specifically, the Administrator is defining the ‘air pollution’ referred to in CAA section 202(a) to be the mix of six long-lived and directly-emitted greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).’ * * * ‘The Administrator has considered how elevated concentrations of the well-mixed greenhouse gases and associated climate change affect public health by evaluating the risks associated with changes in air quality, increases in temperatures, changes in extreme weather events, increases in food- and waterborne pathogens, and changes in aeroallergens.’ 74 FR 66,497. At the outset it is important to understand that carbon dioxide has two relevant properties, as a creator of food and oxygen, and as a greenhouse gas (GHG). As to food and oxygen, carbon dioxide is essential to nearly all life on earth by creating food and oxygen by photosynthesis. Further, it creates more food as its level in the atmosphere increases. For example, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature. As to carbon dioxide as a GHG, the Endangerment Finding is premised on the Net Zero Theory that carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions must be reduced to Net Zero and the use of fossil fuels must be eliminated by 2050 to avoid catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. A key premise the EPA has asserted is, ‘The increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere and the resulting warming have led to more frequent and more intense heat waves and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and retreating snow and ice.’ Further, a foundational premise of everything the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does is that the ‘evidence is clear that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change,’ where ‘main driver means responsible for more than 50% of the change.’ We demonstrate that the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding and of both the EPA and IPCC premises are fatally flawed science, for two key separate and combined reasons: First, both fail to consider contradictory science, including: Second, both are not based on science, and are based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and, furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Frankly, we also demonstrate that the Endangerment Finding is a classic example of what Peter Drucker described as government subordinating science to ‘value-judgments that are the reverse of, and largely incompatible with, any criteria one could possibly call scientific.’ Further, our opinion is that science requires urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march. Scientific details follow.” The comment then goes into a discussion of what is and what is not, science, which TWTW has presented in previous comments by Lindzen and Happer. Section III “The Endangerment Finding Failed to Consider Contradictory Science” begins with: The Endangerment Finding states: ‘The scientific evidence is compelling that elevated concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are the root cause of recently observed climate change. The IPCC conclusion from 2007 has been re-confirmed by the June 2009 USGCRP assessment that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.’ 74 FR 66,518 (footnote deleted). As a matter of physics, the scientific evidence cited by the Endangerment Finding from two government organizations, the IPCC and USGCRP, is false science. (Elaborated in section III.B and D).” [These sections are not presented in this TWTW.] “The five most abundant GHGs are water vapor (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and methane (CH4). Water vapor and clouds account “for more than 90% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.’ Thus, CO2 and all the other GHGs account for less than 10% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat and warm the planet. The Endangerment Finding cites six GHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 FR 66,516. The warming effects of methane and nitrous oxide are also so small that they are irrelevant to climate, as are the latter three. The physics of carbon dioxide and other GHGs is that they lose their capacity to warm the planet as their concentration in the atmosphere increases because of what is called “saturation,” and according to logarithmic equations. Every doubling of CO2 causes a warming of less than 1° C, to first approximation, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The other GHGs cause only a small fraction of the warming from CO2. Focusing on the physics of CO2, it becomes a less effective greenhouse gas at higher concentrations.” Then the comment gives a chart which may be confusing without more explanation and then continues with: “Most importantly, at today’s CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of approximately 425 parts per million and higher, saturation means that CO2 has little ability to absorb heat and warm the planet. Because of saturation, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). Saturation means that from now on, CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and other sources will have little impact on global warming. Since CO2 at today’s level is “saturated,” for this reason alone there is no risk that the continued use of fossil fuels will cause catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. Moreover, the mathematics of logarithms can also be applied to temperature increases since the beginning of the Industrial Age in 1750 when carbon dioxide levels were about 280 ppm. Doubling it to 560 ppm would also only cause a trivial increase in temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The increase in temperature would be even less, and trivial, if carbon dioxide increased from the beginning of the Industrial Age at 280 ppm to today’s 425 ppm, a much smaller increase of 145 ppm than doubling it to 560 ppm. Saturation also explains why temperatures were not catastrophically high over the hundreds of millions of years when CO2 levels were 10 to nearly 20 times higher than they are today, shown in the chart in Part III.C covering 600 million years.” [Part II C is not discussed in this TWTW.] “More specifically, the physics of how changes in atmospheric GHGs affect radiation transfer are described by precise physical equations that have never failed to describe observations. We and Prof. van Wijngaarden applied these formulas to the enormous efforts by the U. S. and worldwide to reduce CO2 emissions to Net Zero by 2050 in a paper that we recommend to those with a technical background.” The comment then discusses US going to net zero carbon dioxide emissions will have a miniscule effect on temperatures. It discusses the difference between the smooth Planck Curve of Earth’s blackbody radiation and the jagged curve of Earth’s radiation to space. The jagged curve identifies the frequencies associated with specific greenhouse gases. This section then concludes with: “Finally, note that CO2 is not nearly as potent a greenhouse gas as water vapor and clouds (especially cirrus clouds). A radiation-blocking effect of only about 3 W/m2 could easily also be produced by changes in the size or height of cloud cover on any given day. This is a complex system, and the idea that one variable, globally average temperature, is changed primarily by one thing, manmade CO2, is baseless. As one of us (Lindzen) has explained: ‘The climate system consists of two turbulent fluids interacting with each other, [ocean and atmosphere]. They are on a rotating planet that is differentially heated by the sun. A vital constituent of the atmospheric component is water in the liquid, solid, and vapor phases, and the changes in phase have vast energetic ramifications. The energy budget of this system involves the absorption and remission of about 200 watts per square meter. Doubling CO2 involves a two percent perturbation to this budget. So do minor changes in clouds, ocean circulations, and other features, and such changes are common. In this complex multifactor system, what is the likelihood that the climate (which itself consists of many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomalies) is controlled by a two percent perturbation in the energy budget due to just one of the numerous variables, namely CO2? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic.’ In conclusion, since CO2 at today’s level is ‘saturated,’ and the warming effects of the other GHGs are so small they are irrelevant to climate, physics demonstrates: Physics demonstrates there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding. For this reason alone, the Endangerment Finding should be repealed.” In the interests of brevity, this TWTW skips over a great deal of important scientific and other arguments to go to the last section citing an important Supreme Court decision and the Conclusion which state [Individual words in boldface were in italics in original]: “V. The Endangerment Finding Is Arbitrary, Capricious, and thus Invalided Under the Supreme Court’s State Farm Decision. As a legal matter, we understand State Farm is a key Supreme Court case that ruled that an agency regulation is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid where, inter alia: The Endangerment Finding fails each of these State Farm mandates: First, Unscientific Evidence. Unscientific evidence, misrepresented as science, is all the EPA provided underlying the Endangerment Finding, demonstrated in Part IV. Congress never intended for the EPA to consider and rely on unscientific evidence in making its Endangerment Finding, as it did. Second, Contradictory Scientific Evidence Ignored. The Endangerment Finding ignored and “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” the robust and reliable contradictory scientific evidence detailed above in Part III. Therefore, the Endangerment Finding is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid for either or both reasons under State Farm. CONCLUSION Accordingly, we demonstrated the Endangerment Finding is based on fatally flawed science, for two reasons: First, it fails to consider contradictory science, including:. Second, it is not based on science, it is based on unscientific sources. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Finally, we repeat, urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it is required because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march.” TWTW comment: It will be very interesting to see how the lower courts treat scientific argument, based on physical evidence, given the Supreme Court’s State Farm decision in 1983 “Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).

It states that the current warming is part of a natural cycle that has been going on throughout the Holocene (starting about 11,700 years ago). The present warm interglacial epoch in the Quaternary period (starting about 2.6 million years ago) features prolonged glacial periods (Ice Ages). The abstract of the paper states: “Cyclical climate change is characteristic of the Holocene, with successive warmings and coolings. A solar forcing mechanism has steered Holocene climate change, expressed by 9 cooling phases known as Bond events. There is reliable geological evidence that the temperatures of most warming phases in the Holocene were globally higher or similar to that of the current warming period, Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers in the northern hemisphere either disappeared or were smaller. During the African Humid Period in the Early and Middle Holocene, much stronger summer monsoons made the Sahara green with growth of savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The modern warming is part of a climatic cycle with a progressive warming after the Little Ice Age, the last cold episode of which occurred at the beginning of the 19th century. Successive climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are based on the assumption that the modern temperature rise is steered exclusively by the increasing content of human-induced CO2 in the atmosphere. If compared with the observational data, these projected temperatures have been highly overestimated.” As climate fluctuations, Bond events are similar to Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, except Bond events are noted in the current warm period (the Holocene), and DO events are noted in glacial periods. The UN IPCC and its colleagues largely ignore all climate history prior to about 1850 when the Earth came out of the Little Ice Age (one of the coldest periods, if not the coldest period, in the Holocene). They have abandoned the scientific method in favor of politics. The Mark paper concludes with: “The Holocene climate change was characterized by cyclical warmings (such as: Holocene Thermal Maximum, Late Bronze Age, Roman Warm Period, MWP) and coolings (Bond Events: including Iron Age Cold Period, Dark Ages Cold Period and LIA). The IPCC claims that current warming is unprecedented in the last 2000 or even the last 125,000 years; this statement is very unconvincing, and it is not supported by the geological data. There is good evidence that both in the last 2000 years as well during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were higher or broadly similar to the ones in the current warming period, the Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers (especially in the northern hemisphere) either disappeared or were smaller. Much stronger summer monsoons in the Early and Middle Holocene made the Sahara green with savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The terms ‘the Holocene Thermal Maximum’ and ‘the Holocene Climatic Optimum’ are avoided by the IPCC (2021), and its popularized statements making the current warming look ‘unprecedented’ and therefore ‘unique’ are false and flatten the climate history (cf. Marcott et al., 2013). The climate is a product of complicated interdependence of many factors that have not been yet sufficiently recognized qualitatively and quantitatively. It is a great scientific challenge that requires an extensive interdisciplinary research. There is a crucial need to make climate science less political and climate policy more scientific.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Acid Oceans? The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “The Ocean Is Now Too Acidic to Be Considered Healthy, Planetary Scientist Says.” Apparently, the reporter did not bother to double check for contrary evidence, particularly with those who understand chemistry. A 2015 paper by Roger Cohen and William Happer “Fundamentals of Ocean pH” begins with [Footnotes omitted here]: “We are often told that the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels will cause dangerous ocean acidification. Actually, the oceans will remain comfortably alkaline and hospitable to life for the foreseeable future. This brief note is a quantitative review of the physical chemistry of ocean pH. High school chemistry and algebra should provide enough background to follow the discussion. An excellent introduction to the chemistry of the oceans can be found in the book: Seawater: Its Composition, Properties and Behavior, by Wright and Colling. More details on ocean pH can be found in a recent review by Tans. 2 Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg (OH)2, and calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4(^-2), which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water.” The paper then goes into some mathematics and chemistry and shows that the oceans will remain alkaline with a pH slightly less than 8, even if rainwater (carbonic acid, H2CO3) becomes more acidic with an atmosphere with a carbon dioxide concentration of 1000 parts per million in volume, more than twice the current level of CO2. The paper concludes with [Figures not shown here]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed.

The CO2 Coalition wrote an “Open Letter to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Concerning Sustainable Livestock Development.” In part, it states: “At no point has science been a matter of majority opinion or even top-down decisions by legal authorities. We see that the FAO is running the risk of finding itself on the wrong side of history if it unethically suppresses free scientific discourse. We therefore strongly recommend that FAO returns to its original mandate of eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, eliminating poverty and driving forward economic progress for all, based on the latest objective climate research.

It stated: “Arrhenius used the term carbolic acid, a mixture of water and carbon dioxide that exists in liquid form but does not exist as a gas in the atmosphere.” TWTW should have stated: “carbonic acid, a compound of water and carbon dioxide.” TWTW appreciates such corrections. ********************* Number of the Week: Less than 10% [H/t Lindzen and Happer] In his book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin writes: “Water vapor is the most important of the greenhouse gases. Of course, the amount in the atmosphere at any given place and time varies greatly (the humidity changes a lot with the weather). But on average, water vapor amounts to only about 0.4 percent of the molecules in the atmosphere. Even so, it accounts for more than 90 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat. John Tyndall, the Irish physicist who was the first to study the infrared properties of gases, eloquently expressed its importance in an 1863 public lecture: ‘Aqueous [water] vapor is a blanket, more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man. Remove for a single summer-night the aqueous vapor from the air which overspreads this country, and you would assuredly destroy every plant capable of being destroyed by a freezing temperature. The warmth of our fields and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space, and the sun would rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost.’ “The next most significant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), is different from water vapor in that its concentration in the atmosphere is much the same all over the globe. CO2 currently accounts for about 7 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.” [Boldface added] (pp 50, 51) [This estimate assumes cloudiness, not clear skies.] Censorship Human Rights Commission’s call to regulate debate around climate change under fire Sky News host Paul Murray has fired up over the Australian Human Rights Commission’s call for regulation to climate change debate.

Part II By John Ridgway, Climate Etc., Sep 23, 2025 In an earlier essay I explained how positive feedbacks can lead to potentially problematic scientific monocultures. I also acknowledged that poor research design and data analysis had become commonplace within the behavioral sciences, largely as a result of a ‘natural selection’, driven by the career enhancement that comes with publication. However, I did not question whether there were any reward structures within climate science that may also have led to a natural selection for bad statistical practice. Fundamentals of Ocean pH By R.

Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science Unmasking Climate Action at UN By Durwood Zaelke , Paul Bledsoe, Real Clear Energy, Sep 23, 2025 Already expensive and deadly climate impacts are increasingly undermining health and public safety, even as agricultural yields are under threat, water supplies are dwindling, and outdoor work is becoming untenable in many regions due to unbearable heat. Yet most concerning is that fast-rising global temperatures, which have rocketed past 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, a key Paris Climate Agreement goal, are now risking tipping points in natural systems that would yield a hot house planet with even more destructive climate impacts.

We find that, at a stand level, trees have become larger over time, with mean tree basal area increasing by 3.3% per decade (95% CI 2.4; 4.1). Larger trees have increased in both number and size, yet we observed similar rates of relative size gain in large and small trees. This evidence is consistent with a resource-driven boost for larger trees but also a reduction in suppression among smaller trees. These results, especially the persistence and consistency of tree size increases across Amazonian forest plots, communities and regions, indicate that any negative impacts of climate change on forests and large trees here have so far been mitigated by the positive effects of increased resources.

But the factors behind that difference were not well understood. Wang and Chavas showed that the rapid growth of storms is tied to “hot spots” in the ocean. These are localized areas where the water is significantly warmer than the surrounding tropical waters. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season gave a striking example of why storm size matters. Hurricane Helene expanded rapidly before making landfall, ballooning into one of the largest storms in U.S. history at an estimated width of over 400 miles and causing unprecedented damage.

What was supposed to be a two-year suspension became permanent, although a small cod fishery was reopened in 2024. This being the 1990s, no one thought to blame climate change for the disappearance of the fish, instead pointing to the massive fishing fleets that had been emptying the oceans of everything that moved for decades. But never ones to pass up a chance, a group of climate scientists published a paper in 2003 based on, of course, climate models not real-world data, and it warned that ocean warming would speed up the decline of North Sea cod which were already almost all gone. Unfortunately for them, though maybe fortunately for the fish, the #HaveItBothWays rule soon kicked into gear.

Pretending this is purely about CO₂ levels is simplistic at best and misleading at worst. As NSIDC itself admits, the flattening trend is still a subject of “active debate” among scientists. Perhaps it’s time for policymakers and journalists to debate it as well — instead of pretending the science is “settled.” So, about that rebounding ice By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 As we’ve mentioned, there are several ways to draw a trend line through complicated data including the one for Arctic ice. But they are not all equally valid. Even statistics involves some art as well as science. But it should not include hocus-pocus. In this regard we continue to insist, in the face of alarmists saying it’s long-term trends that matter, that it is in fact long-term trends that matter. And we also continue to insist, in this regard, that it is the dreaded cherry-picking to lean too hard on the fact that the modern satellite record coincides with a cyclical peak in Arctic ice around 1979 that cannot rationally be ascribed to human influence, since there is no plausible argument that we were cooling the planet from the 1940s through the 1970s, though at the time it was blamed on, yes, our burning fossil fuels by people who seem to start with the verdict that our civilization is evil, rapacious and self-destructive and work backwards to an indictment that fits the short-run evidence.

Their president just approved a report whose conclusion is scientifically impossible! The report is jointly from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). Titled “Effects of Human-Caused Greenhouse Gas Emissions on U.S. Climate, Health, and Welfare,” this squirrelly tome is a formal comment on EPA’s proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding. Clearly NASEM is no longer fit for purpose. Ideally, Congress should revoke its charter. At the least the President should issue an executive order instructing the federal agencies not to use NASEM. It has long been standard practice for agencies launching new programs to run them by NASEM for approval. This practice should stop.

Citing an EPA graph, the report asserts that heat waves have increased since the 1960s. But the report studiously avoids another more complete EPA graph showing that heatwaves have dramatically decreased since the 1930s. The Rocky Mountain Institute’s Climate & DEI Colonialism in Africa By Ken Braun, Real Clear Energy, Sep 23, 2025 According to Our World in Data, there are 677.4 million people living without “an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.” Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, and 156 million of these desperate souls—23% of the world total—reside in those three nations set to receive RMI’s “women energy practitioners.” But rather than bringing genuine and desperately needed energy to Africa, the Rocky Mountain Institute and its deeply deluded donors are offering unreliable renewables delivered by a women-only DEI initiative. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? Beware How the Climate Crusade ‘Partners’ With the Media and ‘Educates’ the Courts By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Sep 24, 2025 The Climate Crisis Anti Baby Movement By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The Aussie ABC thinks Zoomers are staging a baby strike until their elders fix the climate crisis. Claim: Aussie Climate Refugees are Moving to Tasmania By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 24, 2025 So, despite the ABC’s attempt to make it look like climate change is driving a demographic shift to colder states, this is no more happening in Australia than it is in the USA. Warm lifestyle states like Queensland and Florida both enjoy strong population growth and will continue to be a favorite destination for the foreseeable future.

NPR warned of “irreversible” sea-level rise in 2023, ignoring tide gauge records that show no acceleration beyond historical norms. News outlets regularly report on “unprecedented” floods, yet data indicate no uptick in floods due to climate change. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda on Children Waves of conformism By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Speaking of long-term trends and data, the cool kids or at this point the hot kids are all independently stampeding to attribution science, a form of hocus-pocus that bypasses evidence to get the verdict in question. For instance “Recent Canadian heat waves made much more likely by human-caused climate change” from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Which you might think means they have data proving they are happening more often. Pfft. This is attribution science, where all you only need models, not data. Communicating Better to the Public – Protest A picturesque Yorkshire village is battling an ugly net-zero facility By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 21, 2025 Questioning European Green The greenlash is here: Britain cannot afford Net Zero and democracy at the same time By Maurice Cousins, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 Link to report: Britons’ attitudes to high energy bills: the permacrisis that keeps burning By Chris Annous & Archie Herrick, More in Common, September 2025, Funded by Octopus Energy, UK energy supplier. Click to access britain-s-high-energy-bills_-the-permacrisis-that-keeps-on-burning-6.pdf The survey and focus groups referenced in this report and the writing of this report has been funded by Octopus Energy. More in Common has maintained, as is the case for all of our partnership work, full editorial independence when conducting this research and writing this report. The views expressed within this report are therefore the views of More in Common. From Cousins: Contrary to what critics claim, opposition to renewables is not an anti-climate science or ideological position. Green energy is capital-intensive, infrastructure-heavy, and drives extraordinary system inefficiency. Even if turbines and panels fall in price, the total bill to consumers will remain higher than the legacy model of baseload generation. Britain’s industrial disaster By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Questioning Green Elsewhere Admitting the obvious By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 We also like advocates of wind and solar thinking and talking about the physics and engineering of grid stability. If they really can make it work, if they can overcome problems of scale and distribution and battery technology leaps forward and so on, we could be persuaded that wind and solar have a bright future. But we really do need to see the practicalities acknowledged and analyzed. Including the very basic point that, when you get down to such things, it’s complicated, especially given the ways in which subsidies distort the picture. And that one thing that’s certainly complicated, for them anyway, is that the “green energy transition” at least coincided with, if it did not cause, a vast surge in the cost of power.

(2) This CO2 increase causes global warming. (3) This global warming causes the plaintiffs claimed damages. Judicial Limits on Glyphosate and Climate ‘Jackpot Justice’ Litigation Narrowly defined decision provides guidance on ‘evidence’ for alleged cause of harm By Paul Driessen, WUWT, Sep 23, 2025 Although the US Supreme Court frequently overrules it, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (covering California, eight other western states and two US territories) deserves applause for its recent Engilis v. Monsanto decision. The Fallacy of ‘Exxon Knew” (Part II) By Robert Bradley Jr. Master Resource, Sep 24, 2025 Part I, Sep 23, 2025 Bradley: This memo from certain employees never made it to a company position for cause. Global cooling was the bigger concern back then, and the above memo did not investigate the SO2 offset, much less the benefits from CO2 fertilization and incremental warming. Peak Oil and Peak Gas was the intellectual/practical concern of this era. [SEPP Comment: The memo is dated October 16, 1979. The administration of President Carter (1977 to 1981) and Congress passed laws advocating the use of coal to replace oil and natural gas, which, based on faulty models, Washington feared would soon be exhausted.] Subsidies and Mandates Forever Congressional testimony reveals the hidden causes behind America’s looming $38 billion energy rate hikes: ‘If things keep going like this, [bills] are gonna be higher next year’ “The U.S. is falling far behind global competitors.” By Kristen Lawrence, The Cool Down, Sep 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] On top of all these reasons for soaring energy rates, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is making electricity more expensive by phasing out tax credits for clean energy, such as solar and wind power, resulting in slower construction of renewable projects and restricting the supply of affordable power. [SEPP Comment: If wind and solar are low cost, why are subsidies needed?] Offshore windfarm receives £2bn subsidies in just six years Press release, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 As a result, Hornsea 1 is currently receiving a guaranteed £200 per megawatt hour for its power, nearly three times current market prices.

I’ll have a play around, but it seems they avoid an awful lot of legwork and analysis which I have been doing on spreadsheets. I’ve shown below a typical CfD graph, which shows subsidy costs by quarter, and the quarterly market price. I would recommend using it to convince doubters, as it is the official source. London Array Subsidies Hit £300 Million Last Year By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 At current prices, London Array has been paid £3.6 billion in subsidies since it opened in 2013.

California Dreaming California’s Latest Climate Theater: Newsom Signs Another Expensive Illusion By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The core of the package is an extension of the cap-and-trade program—rebranded “cap-and-invest”—all the way to 2045. That rebranding glosses over that the structure is largely the same: companies must either reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, buy emission allowances, or invest in offsets. The revenues from auctioning allowances are then redistributed (some), invested (many), or spent (often). In recent years, those auctions have raised between $3 billion and $4.3 billion annually. These revenues fund programs ranging from wildfire prevention to transportation, housing, and utility credits. California Dems Scramble To Boost Oil Production After Running Refiners Out Of Town By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Sep 19, 2025 “After years of pushing radical climate policies that punished working families, Governor Newsom is finally waking up to what Californians need, he’s now scrambling to secure the very fossil fuels he tried to eliminate,” CEO of the American Energy Institute Jason Isaac told the Daily Caller News Foundation previously. “This sudden embrace of petroleum isn’t leadership, it’s survival.

A 20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). From Healy: Implications for Fire Management – The paper likely argues for integrating Indigenous fire stewardship into contemporary land management—not just as a cultural restoration, but as an ecological necessity. – It challenges dominant narratives that treat fire as inherently destructive, instead reframing it as a regenerative force when guided by traditional ecological knowledge.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The founder and chief executive officer of the brand management and entertainment firm expects to transition to executive chairman in around two years. Senior Editor, Men's Jamie Salter has come a long way in the past 15 years. The 62-year-old Toronto native started his career in sports marketing and was the cofounder of Ride snowboards in the early 1990s. After that company went public, he and Fanatics’ founder and executive chairman Michael Rubin created Global Sports Inc., which eventually became GSI Commerce. Once he exited that business, Salter turned his attention to licensing, cofounding Hilco Consumer Capital. After a difference of opinion with Hilco’s majority owner, he partnered with Leonard Green and created Authentic Brands Group. Related Articles Shoe Industry News Puma Shares Seesaw on Authentic Brands Group Takeover Speculation Fashion Features WWD's 115 Newsmakers: S to Z Today, Authentic has amassed a portfolio that encompasses more than 50 brands including Reebok, Brooks Brothers and Champion that generate annual retail sales of $32 billion globally. The addition of Guess by early year will bring that number to $38 billion. But that’s not good enough for Salter, whose goal is to reach $100 billion in sales within the next five years by purchasing brands that have sales of more than $1 billion with global expansion potential while also expanding his reach in the entertainment and hospitality sectors. You May Also Like Authentic, which is on track to post 7 percent organic growth from its brands this year, now has headquarters in New York, London and Shanghai and offices in Los Angeles, Miami, Tokyo and South Korea. It counts 1,800 licensing partners globally, and its licensees operate 16,000 stores and 29,000 shops-in-shop around the world. The group is by far the largest of what is a new wave of brand management companies, which are rewriting the fashion and retail landscape in the U.S. by snapping up brand seemingly every week. While it’s a model that first emerged in the U.S. almost 50 years ago, Authentic and the likes of WHP Global, Bluestar and Marquee Brands are now taking it to another level. Here, Salter talks about his journey, how he’s built Authentic and his plans to pass the reins to the newly named president, Matt Maddox, within the next two years. WWD: How has the licensing model evolved since you started 15 years ago? Jamie Salter: It’s dramatically different. When we came into the business, Iconix was really the prize in the industry. It was doing DTR [direct-to-retail] with big retailers, and it was very item driven and category specific. When I looked at the business back then, I always asked the question, “Why don’t they sell home and shoes and whatever?” Well, it wasn’t because they didn’t want to, but they had a DTR [strategy]. So I said, OK, I know they’re doing really well, but that’s not going to work for us. We have to have another angle on how can we do well in the licensing business. So we took a different approach. WWD: And what was that? J.S.: Our approach was we’re going to go after wholesalers, and we’re going to do it by category and by territory, and they’re going to have to sell into retailers. That was very different from what Iconix was doing. So you could say we got lucky, or you could say we’re smart. I would say it’s probably a little bit of both. But what it really proved to me was you could actually grow the businesses so much bigger. WWD: Was there a downside? J.S.: You could argue our model was more expensive to run than a traditional licensing model, because we had to put a lot of money from the royalties that we were collecting into marketing. In the beginning, we weren’t putting enough into the marketing side of the business, but we learned very early on — when my partner Nick [Woodhouse] came into the business — that we really had to spend money on marketing. But we couldn’t afford it. It was hard. WWD: But I assume you decided to make the investment? J.S.: I met a guy named Adam Kronengold who is still with me today. He’s our chief digital officer. He was one of our first employees and in his interview, he asked me how many social media followers I had. I said, “What do you mean? Me? Jamie Salter?” He said, “No, not you, your company.” I said, “I don’t really understand the question.” So he goes on Instagram and says, “You don’t have an account.” This is in 2010, and he said, “Marilyn Monroe has an account. She has 250,000 followers. You know you can talk to people, post stuff and market.” I said, “How much does that cost?” He says, “It’s free. You can put up a post, send your message and tell people where Marilyn Monroe is being sold. You can do whatever you want. It’s your channel.” WWD: Guess he convinced you. J.S.: I asked him how Instagram made money and he said it didn’t make a lot then, but their whole strategy was to get everybody on social media and eventually turn it into an advertising platform. I said, “I like free — you’re hired.” So we were one of the very early adopters in the social media world. I think that is really the base of Authentic Brands — we really built the company like a tech start-up. Here we are 15 years after and we’re still like a start-up in the way we think. We’re always on the cusp of what’s next. WWD: How do you differ from the other brand management companies you compete with today like WHP Global, Marquee Brands and Bluestar? J.S.: We welcome competition, and we want them to do well, because if they do well, it’s good for us. But everyone builds a niche for themselves. WHP is using the Iconix/Sequential playbook and they’ve transitioned from that a little bit. I think Yehuda [Shmidman, WHP’s chief executive officer] learned some good hard lessons through his experience there and he’s building a pretty good platform [at WHP]. But scale matters now in this business because of the money you have to spend in order to build these brands and keep them relevant in the marketplace. We have a big international platform and nobody else really has that. But where we’re really separate from them is that we have 80 people in the marketing department today, we have 700 million social media followers — that’s 10 percent of the people that live on the planet. We’re on TikTok and WeChat and Instagram and Red Note — we’re on every platform around the globe. We have social media influencers in 150 different languages. WWD: Is that why you’re often always the first call when a brand is for sale? J.S.: If you have an opportunity to partner with Authentic versus Bluestar versus WHP, you’re going to partner with Authentic if it’s the same economics, just because it’s a much bigger platform. We can actually pay more because our platform is so efficient. And we can run businesses more efficiently because of our sheer size. WWD: You swooped in at the last minute to buy Guess even though WHP already had a deal. What happened there? J.S.: They always say anything’s for sale for the right price. But that’s just not true. [Guess cofounder] Paul Marciano was looking for a partner and unless he got the best deal for his shareholders, he would never have sold the company. So he’s selling 51 percent to us, and the family [with CEO Carlos Alberini] will own other 49 percent. Relationships matter, strategy matters, legacy matters. Paul’s last name is on the door. Look at LVMH: the family is all involved in the business and I think that’s why it’s such an incredible company. They learned from their father and they care — the legacy lives on. My name is on the door too — Authentic is the Salters. My family will be involved with Authentic Brands forever, I hope. WWD: All four of your sons are in the business, right? J.S.: Yes. And at some point, Jamie Salter will have to hang up the skates as I get older. WWD: In January, you brought in Matt Maddox, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, as president. What is his role? J.S.: He worked with Steve Wynn for 22 years and for the last four or five years, was CEO of Wynn Properties. Everyone asked me why I didn’t hire someone from the fashion business. Look, we’re in the licensing business, which means we’re effectively a landlord. We buy these great brands, we fix them up, we market them and we rent out rooms. And the rooms happen to be shoes and socks and intimate apparel and home goods. And we do that by territory, by category. Matt understood the retail luxury space, because he has his own mall at the Wynn. He understood that he has to rent out his rooms every day. He has to market. He understood the entertainment business and events and celebrities and athletes. He has relationships with all these. We knew a lot of the same people and were partners with the Wynn through our live events division. WWD: Sounds like a good match. J.S.: Matt was offered some of the biggest jobs in the United States and initially he said no to me [when I offered him the job]. I asked him why and he said, “I’ve looked at your business. It’s working really well. You’re doing an incredible job. You’re not going anywhere. You don’t need me.” So I called Steve [Wynn] and told him he had to convince Matt to take the job. He did and we hired Matt. WWD: What are your ultimate plans for Matt? J.S.: I made a commitment to Matt that he would become the CEO of the company in the next two years. I will move to executive chairman. And you know, people ask me, “Are you OK with that?” Well, I’m super excited. Matt is 49, he’s young, he’s beyond smart. He’s working incredibly well with the team. He’s working great with my children, which is really important to me. He’s mentoring my son, Corey, who, you know, I ultimately want one day to run the company with his brothers. But I’ve got an incredible partner in Matt, who I believe will lead Authentic to $100 billion. WWD: The business community is filled with founders who find they can’t actually step aside when they turn over the reins to someone else. Why is this different? J.S.: Like I told Matt, I’m not going anywhere. But we’ve got to stay young; we’ve got to stay nimble. He understands the loyalty side of the business better than me because they had a big loyalty program at the Wynn. He understands the digital side of the business. He’s doing an unbelievable job upgrading Authentic on the process side. And if we do decide to go public over the next year or two, he’ll be an excellent CEO that the Street can rely on. I’m excited to just continue doing what I’m really good at, which is building great relationships around the world and working on the M&A side, and I have a great partner in Matt to run the day-to-day. WWD: Sounds like hiring someone from outside the fashion industry is working out for you. J.S.: I’m a big believer in hiring outside the industry — not that we don’t hire inside the industry, because we still need merchants and great marketing people. But if you really look at Authentic, the average age here is about 35. And they come out of the digital space, the legal space, the finance system. Authentic is a big marketing department, a big legal department, a big digital department. So, we’re hiring people from Meta and Google and Microsoft and Amazon. You still need merchants to touch and feel and make great product, because you can have the greatest digital team and the greatest marketing team but if don’t have good product, then it doesn’t work. But at the end of the day, data is everything. WWD: What do you look for when you’re hiring people? J.S.: When you’re hot, you attract great talent. When I’m hiring someone, the first question I ask is, can AI do this job? If the answer is no, the second question is: is that person smarter than you? And we’re a loyal group, so if you’re really good, you’re going to be here forever. But Authentic is not for everyone. Do not come here if you’re looking for a 9-to-5 job because we work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We’re a global company, so we’re always working. With the globalization of the world, the internet, social media, the news cycles and staying ahead of trends and culture, you always have to be on. WWD: You also have other components to your business beyond brand management. J.S.: Yes. Twenty-five percent of the platform is entertainment. [Our competitors] don’t have an entertainment business. And entertainment, in my opinion, drives fashion culture. The entertainment business is really music culture and sports culture, which is where we have a big edge. The other 75 percent of our turnover is rooted in the lifestyle space. WWD: How do you evolve the company going forward, where are the opportunities? J.S.: We think we’re just scratching the surface. I know people think that’s kind of crazy with a business that has about $32 billion in annual retail systemwide sales. But we think we can be about $100 billion within the next five years. It’s not as crazy as you think when we pull off deals like Guess, which does $6 billion at retail. There are lots of other brands that are in that $1 billion to $10 billion range that we could buy. And we really, truly believe that we will crack those opportunities. Over the next five years, we’ll do another four or five big deals and that’s another $50 billion. This year alone, and the year is not over, we added almost $7 billion in revenue. WWD: You were close to going public a couple of years ago and then decided against it. Are you revisiting the idea? J.S.: Authentic is a very different model. We trade like a tech company because we are a tech company. Think about it. When you have 75 percent margin, 99 percent cash conversion and virtually no capex, you trade like a software company. So could we be public? The answer is yes. Should we be public? I don’t know. There’s no need to be. Why is SpaceX not public? It doesn’t need to be. We trade at a very high multiple; we have 36 percent growth in the company. We’re low levered. We took our first money from Leonard Green in 2010 and the company has been self-funded since then. WWD: But you have other investors including General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, Simon Property Group and Brookfield, among others. J.S.: True. There’s been $9 billion of secondaries in the last three years, but that’s just one shareholder selling to a new buyer. There’s been no need for investment from outside. We actually just bought $1 billion of stock back and retired the shares, so the company’s very flush with cash. WWD: A lot of the brands you buy are distressed. Is that what you look for? J.S.: The brands aren’t necessarily distressed, the companies are. Reebok wasn’t a bad brand. Adidas just wasn’t putting the effort into one of the greatest athletic brands in the world. Their focus was on building Adidas. They milked Reebok as far as they possibly could, and they didn’t need it anymore. We’ve owned Reebok now for a couple years and we’ve almost doubled the business. We still have lots of work to do, but Reebok is a $6 billion business and our ambition is to grow to a $10 billion business over the next three years — and we feel very confident we’re going to get there. WWD: So what is the criteria you use when exploring a purchase? J.S.: A good brand but a broken business. Champion wasn’t broken but Hanes needed liquidity. Truth be told, I spoke to Gildan before we bought Champion. I said, “Let’s go buy Hanes together. I’ll take Champion. You take Hanes.” We ended up buying Champion. They ended up buying Hanes, which is interesting. We could have done the deal together. Anyway, our model is to license by category, by territory, to best-in-class partners. So you get the best underwear-maker, you get the best sock-maker, you get the best sportswear-maker. It means the business grows much quicker. But we have to unwind the overhead so we can run these companies much more efficiently. People always say, “When you buy a company, all the jobs go away.” It’s not true — lots of new jobs are created. When we look at our portfolio, I would say that probably 75 percent of the jobs either stay or new jobs are created. So maybe people lose their jobs in California, but there are new jobs in New York, and it’s more efficient. WWD: Where do you see the growth coming from in the future? J.S.: Entertainment and kids’ animation. Those are two really big areas for us. We believe entertainment really does drive lifestyle. So we’re going to continue to drive that. And when I say the kids’ space, think Disney, think Mattel, that type of stuff. And with Matt’s background, we’re moving into the hospitality business. We’ve done multiple deals now for hotels and condos. We have the Barneys hotel. We have Sports Illustrated resorts, we have Eddie Bauer lodges. We have Nautica condos going up in Mexico. Our hospitality business is bigger than you would think. Also, beauty. Our beauty business is over a couple billion dollars today, but there’s big opportunity there. And you’re going to see us do more deals like David Beckham and Shaq. WWD: Speaking of Beckham and Shaquille O’Neal, neither of them has been playing for a while. And you also own the rights to Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, who are dead. J.S.: We don’t call them dead — they’re icons, and with AI coming into play, Marilyn Monroe is going to be on fire in 2026, which is her 100th anniversary [of her birth]. We’ve done an enormous number of deals around Marilyn Monroe. And don’t be surprised if you see her in movies again. And look at what’s going on with Elvis Presley. There was the movie and we now have an immersive theater production, Elvis Evolution, at the 02 in London. WWD: But how do you appeal to young people who don’t know Elvis and never saw Shaq or David Beckham play? J.S.: Shaq has never been bigger — no pun intended. Shaq’s business is 10 times as big as when we partnered with him in 2015. And David Beckham‘s business has doubled since we joined forces Now, we’ve only been working on David’s business for a couple years — Shaq’s we’ve owned much longer. I’m not going to say live celebrities are better, but there are bigger opportunities than if they’re not with us anymore. WWD: Let’s talk about the Authentic Luxury Group. Can you explain what that is and how it’s working? J.S.: ALG is a joint venture between Saks Global and us that licenses the IP of the Saks brands and select Authentic premium brands. Richard [Baker, executive chairman of Saks Global] has had a bit of a bumpy road. He is a total optimist and a great visionary, but he needs to prove to the world that financially, he’s set up properly. It seems he’s on the right track now but we’re going to continue to be careful. We’re going to continue to build the affordable luxury — or premium — side of our business. Luxury is a word you have to be careful with. LVMH is luxury, Kering is luxury, Prada is luxury. Vince is premium, Brooks Brothers is premium, Hugo Boss is premium. We’ll continue to play in the premium space in a big way, because it’s the next level from where we are today. We have the full support of Saks, Neiman’s and Amazon, because that’s the joint venture, and we’ll fully support Richard and his journey. But we’re going to be careful. WWD: Are you still looking to buy Marc Jacobs? J.S.: I can’t really comment on that. What I will tell you is we will continue to look at companies in that space, like Marc Jacobs, and we’ll see where it goes. WWD: Let’s talk about the whole department store and retail space where you have a lot of partners. It’s not easy out there. J.S.: We have to go where the customers go. If T.J. Maxx is a winner, we’ve got to sell them. if Burlington, Target and Walmart are winners, we’ve got to sell them. The consumption is the same as it was a year ago — people aren’t buying any less product. They’re just buying from different places. So we continue to go where the customers go, and that’s really been our model. We think independent retailers, or omnichannel retailers like Lucky or Brooks Brothers, are actually important to building these brands. It’s tough, but it’s important to the model. Today, we have about 6,000 licensed full-price/outlet stores around the globe. And then there are another 24,000 shops-in-shop. So when you really look at our portfolio, half of our volume is done through stores that have our name above the door, and that’s a big investment. It’s going to take a long time before Kohl’s and JCPenney and Macy’s are not here anymore. But they’ve got to continue to reinvent themselves. Great retailers survive. Look at Harrods: it’s packed wall-to-wall all the time. WWD: Why do you think that is? J.S.: It may be the model: a department store made up of all concessions. It doesn’t matter what concession [shop] you go into, one’s better than the next one — they’re all just amazing. Take food: you can’t just have a food hall anymore, you have to have restaurants. Look at David Simon [head of Simon Properties]: everyone asks why his stock is so high. It’s because he reinvents himself all the time. He never gets stale. So when you go into a Simon mall, it’s busier than everyone else’s because he’s constantly looking at the best brands and reshuffling things. I don’t think the mall is dead. I think the mall is very alive — if you’re in the right malls. And I don’t think the department store is dead. It just needs to be reinvented. Now, are we over-retailed in America? The answer is yes. That’s why going online is critical. If you want to be in this business, you’ve got to go where the customers go. WWD: There’s a lot of criticism about the licensing model. Why are you so enamored with it? J.S.: There are two types of licensing. One really comes out of the animation business. Look at Disney: it’s the greatest company in the world. And what do they do? They make movies. They make TV shows. Then they have the parks where they sell you a lot of merchandise. I’ve got that same attitude. Authentic has content and experiences and if we continue to do that, we can license our brands and be successful. If you’re just brand slapping and there’s no meat behind it, I think you will die a slow death. You have to treat your brands like your children. You can’t give them back. If you don’t constantly maintain your brands, you’re not going to win. And I think that’s where licensing gets a bad reputation. Disney has done an unbelievable job — we think they’re the best of the best of the best. They’re number one, we’re number two, and they’re way above us. But we’re working hard every single day to continue to make this a better place. Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Full Content:
Soundtrack: Queens of the Stone Age - First It Giveth Before we go any further: This is, for the third time this year, the longest newsletter I've ever written, weighing in somewhere around 18,500 words. I've written it specifically to be read at your leisure — dip in and out where you'd like — but also in one go. This is my comprehensive case that yes, we’re in a bubble, one that will inevitably (and violently) collapse in the near future. I'll also be cutting this into a four-part episode starting tomorrow on my podcast Better Offline. I deeply appreciate your time. If you like this newsletter, please think about subscribing to the premium, which I write weekly. Thanks for reading. Alright, let’s do this one last time. In 2022, a (kind-of) company called OpenAI surprised the world with a website called ChatGPT that could generate text that sort-of sounded like a person using a technology called Large Language Models (LLMs), which can also be used to generate images, video and computer code. Large Language Models require entire clusters of servers connected with high-speed networking, all containing this thing called a GPU — graphics processing units. These are different to the GPUs in your Xbox, or laptop, or gaming PC. They cost much, much more, and they’re good at doing the processes of inference (the creation of the output of any LLM) and training (feeding masses of training data to models, or feeding them information about what a good output might look like, so they can later identify a thing or replicate it). These models showed some immediate promise in their ability to articulate concepts or generate video, visuals, audio, text and code. They also immediately had one glaring, obvious problem: because they’re probabilistic, these models can’t actually be relied upon to do the same thing every single time. So, if you generated a picture of a person that you wanted to, for example, use in a story book, every time you created a new page, using the same prompt to describe the protagonist, that person would look different — and that difference could be minor (something that a reader should shrug off), or it could make that character look like a completely different person. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of generative AI meant that whenever you asked it a question, it would guess as to the answer, not because it knew the answer, but rather because it was guessing on the right word to add in a sentence based on previous training data. As a result, these models would frequently make mistakes — something which we later referred to as “hallucinations.” And that’s not even mentioning the cost of training these models, the cost of running them, the vast amounts of computational power they required, the fact that the legality of using material scraped from books and the web without the owner’s permission was (and remains) legally dubious, or the fact that nobody seemed to know how to use these models to actually create profitable businesses. These problems were overshadowed by something flashy, and new, and something that investors — and the tech media — believed would eventually automate the single thing that’s proven most resistant to automation: namely, knowledge work and the creative economy. This newness and hype and these expectations sent the market into a frenzy, with every hyperscaler immediately creating the most aggressive market for one supplier I’ve ever seen. NVIDIA has sold over $200 billion of GPUs since the beginning of 2023, becoming the largest company on the stock market and trading at over $170 as of writing this sentence only a few years after being worth $19.52 a share. While I’ve talked about some of the propelling factors behind the AI wave — automation and novelty — that’s not a complete picture. A huge reason why everybody decided to “do AI” was because the software industry’s growth was slowing, with SaaS (Software As A Service) company valuations stalling or dropping, resulting in the terrifying prospect of companies having to “under promise and over deliver” and “be efficient.” Things that normal companies — those whose valuations aren’t contingent on ever-increasing, ever-constant growth — don’t have to worry about, because they’re normal companies. Suddenly, there was the promise of a new technology — Large Language Models — that were getting exponentially more powerful, which was mostly a lie but hard to disprove because “powerful” can mean basically anything, and the definition of “powerful” depended entirely on whoever you asked at any given time, and what that person’s motivations were. The media also immediately started tripping on its own feet, mistakenly claiming OpenAI’s GPT-4 model tricked a Taskrabbit into solving a CAPTCHA (it didn’t — this never happened), or saying that “people who don’t know how to code already [used] bots to produce full-fledged games,” and if you’re wondering what “full-fledged” means, it means “pong” and a cobbled-together rolling demo of SkyRoads, a game from 1993. The media (and investors) helped peddle the narrative that AI was always getting better, could do basically anything, and that any problems you saw today would be inevitably solved in a few short months, or years, or, well, at some point I guess. LLMs were touted as a digital panacea, and the companies building them offered traditional software companies the chance to plug these models into their software using an API, thus allowing them to ride the same generative AI wave that every other company was riding. The model companies similarly started going after individual and business customers, offering software and subscriptions that promised the world, though this mostly boiled down to chatbots that could generate stuff, and then doubled down with the promise of “agents” — a marketing term that’s meant to make you think “autonomous digital worker” but really means “broken digital product.” Throughout this era, investors and the media spoke with a sense of inevitability that they never really backed up with data. It was an era based on confidently-asserted “vibes.” Everything was always getting better and more powerful, even though there was never much proof that this was truly disruptive technology, other than in its ability to disrupt apps you were using with AI — making them worse by, for example, suggesting questions on every Facebook post that you could ask Meta AI, but which Meta AI couldn’t answer. “AI” was omnipresent, and it eventually grew to mean everything and nothing. OpenAI would see its every move lorded over like a gifted child, its CEO Sam Altman called the “Oppenheimer of Our Age,” even if it wasn’t really obvious why everyone was impressed. GPT-4 felt like something a bit different, but was it actually meaningful? The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is built and sold on not just faith, but a series of myths that the AI boosters expect us to believe with the same certainty that we treat things like gravity, or the boiling point of water. Can large language models actually replace coders? Not really, no, and I’ll get into why later in the piece. Can Sora — OpenAI’s video creation tool — replace actors or animators? No, not at all, but it still fills the air full of tension because you can immediately see who is pre-registered to replace everyone that works for them. AI is apparently replacing workers, but nobody appears to be able to prove it! But every few weeks a story runs where everybody tries to pretend that AI is replacing workers with some poorly-sourced and incomprehensible study, never actually saying “someone’s job got replaced by AI” because it isn’t happening at scale, and because if you provide real-world examples, people can actually check. To be clear, some people have lost jobs to AI, just not the white collar workers, software engineers, or really any of the career paths that the mainstream media and AI investors would have you believe. Brian Merchant has done excellent work covering how LLMs have devoured the work of translators, using cheap, “almost good” automation to lower already-stagnant wages in a field that was already hurting before the advent of generative AI, with some having to abandon the field, and others pushed into bankruptcy. I’ve heard the same for art directors, SEO experts, and copy editors, and Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal covered these last year. These are all fields with something in common: shitty bosses with little regard for their customers who have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to slash contract labor. To quote Merchant, “the drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of ‘powerful AI’ encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have.” Across the board, the people being “replaced” by AI are the victims of lazy, incompetent cost-cutters who don’t care if they ship poorly-translated text. To quote Merchant again, “[AI hype] has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting “good enough” automation output for video games and media products.” Yet the jobs crisis facing translators speaks to the larger flaws of the Large Language Model era, and why other careers aren’t seeing this kind of disruption. Generative AI creates outputs, and by extension defines all labor as some kind of output created from a request. In the case of translation, it’s possible for a company to get by with a shitty version, because many customers see translation as “what do these words say,” even though (as one worker told Merchant) translation is about conveying meaning. Nevertheless, “translation” work had already started to condense to a world where humans would at times clean up machine-generated text, and the same worker warned that the same might come for other industries. Yet the problem is that translation is a heavily output-driven industry, one where (idiot) bosses can say “oh yeah that’s fine” because they ran an output back through Google Translate and it seemed fine in their native tongue. The problems of a poor translation are obvious, but the customers of translation are, it seems, often capable of getting by with a shitty product. The problem is that most jobs are not output-driven at all, and what we’re buying from a human being is a person’s ability to think. Every CEO talking about AI replacing workers is an example of the real problem: that most companies are run by people who don’t understand or experience the problems they’re solving, don’t do any real work, don’t face any real problems, and thus can never be trusted to solve them. The Era of the Business Idiot is the result of letting management consultants and neoliberal “free market” sociopaths take over everything, leaving us with companies run by people who don’t know how the companies make money, just that they must always make more. When you’re a big, stupid asshole, every job that you see is condensed to its outputs, and not the stuff that leads up to the output, or the small nuances and conscious decisions that make an output good as opposed to simply acceptable, or even bad. What does a software engineer do? They write code! What does a writer do? They write words! What does a hairdresser do? They cut hair! Yet that’s not actually the case. As I’ll get into later, a software engineer does far more than just code, and when they write code they’re not just saying “what would solve this problem?” with a big smile on their face — they’re taking into account their years of experience, what code does, what code could do, all the things that might break as a result, and all of the things that you can’t really tell from just looking at code, like whether there’s a reason things are made in a particular way. A good coder doesn’t just hammer at the keyboard with the aim of doing a particular task. They factor in questions like: How does this functionality fit into the code that’s already here? Or, if someone has to update this code in the future, how do I make it easy for them to understand what I’ve written and to make changes without breaking a bunch of other stuff? A writer doesn’t just “write words.” They jostle ideas and ideals and emotions and thoughts and facts and feelings into a condensed piece of text, explaining both what’s happening and why it’s happening from their perspective, finding nuanced ways to convey large topics, none of which is the result of a single (or many) prompts but the ever-shifting sand of a writer’s brain. Good writing is a fight between a bunch of different factors: structure, style, intent, audience, and prioritizing the things that you (or your client) care about in the text. It’s often emotive — or at the very least, driven or inspired by a given emotion — which is something that an AI simply can’t replicate in a way that’s authentic and believable. And a hairdresser doesn’t just cut hair, but cuts your hair, which may be wiry, dry, oily, long, short, healthy, unhealthy, on a scalp with particular issues, at a time of year when perhaps you want to change length, at a time that fits you, in “the way you like” which may be impossible to actually write down but they get it just right. And they make conversation, making you feel at ease while they snip and clip away at your tresses, with you having to trust that they’ll get it right. This is the true nature of labor that executives fail to comprehend at scale: that the things we do are not units of work, but extrapolations of experience, emotion, and context that cannot be condensed in written meaning. Business Idiots see our labor as the result of a smart manager saying “do this,” rather than human ingenuity interpreting both a request and the shit the manager didn’t say. What does a CEO do? Uhhh, um, well, a Harvard study says they spend 25% of their time on “people and relationships,” 25% on “functional and business unit reviews,” 16% on “organization and culture,” and 21% on “strategy,” with a few percent here and there for things like “professional development.” That’s who runs the vast majority of companies: people that describe their work predominantly as “looking at stuff,” “talking to people” and “thinking about what we do next.” The most highly-paid jobs in the world are impossible to describe, their labor described in a mish-mash of LinkedInspiraton, yet everybody else’s labor is an output that can be automated. As a result, Large Language Models seem like magic. When you see everything as an outcome — an outcome you may or may not understand, and definitely don’t understand the process behind, let alone care about — you kind of already see your workers as LLMs. You create a stratification of the workforce that goes beyond the normal organizational chart, with senior executives — those closer to the class level of CEO — acting as those who have risen above the doldrums of doing things to the level of “decisionmaking,” a fuzzy term that can mean everything from “making nuanced decisions with input from multiple different subject-matter experts” to, as ServiceNow Bill McDermott did in 2022, “[make] it clear to everybody [in a boardroom of other executives], everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.” The same extends to some members of the business and tech media that have, for the most part, gotten by without having to think too hard about the actual things the companies are saying. I realize this sounds a little mean, and I must be clear it doesn’t mean that these people know nothing, just that it’s been possible to scoot through the world without thinking too hard about whether or not something is true. When Salesforce said back in 2024 that its “Einstein Trust Layer” and AI would be “transformational for jobs,” the media dutifully wrote it down and published it without a second thought. It fully trusted Marc Benioff when he said that Agentforce agents would replace human workers, and then again when he said that AI agents are doing “30% to 50% of all the work in Salesforce itself,” even though that’s an unproven and nakedly ridiculous statement. Salesforce’s CFO said earlier this year that AI wouldn’t boost sales growth in 2025. One would think this would change how they’re covered, or how seriously one takes Marc Benioff. It hasn’t, because nobody is paying attention. In fact, nobody seems to be doing their job. This is how the core myths of generative AI were built: by executives saying stuff and the media publishing it without thinking too hard. AI is replacing workers! AI is writing entire computer programs! AI is getting exponentially more-powerful! What does “powerful” mean? That the models are getting better on benchmarks that are rigged in their favor, but because nobody fucking explains it, regular people are regularly told that AI is “powerful.” The only thing “powerful” about generative AI is its mythology. The world’s executives, entirely disconnected from labor and actual production, are doing the only thing they know how to — spend a bunch of money and say vague stuff about “AI being the future.” There are people — journalists, investors, and analysts — that have built entire careers on filling in the gaps for the powerful as they splurge billions of dollars and repeat with increasing desperation that “the future is here” as absolutely nothing happens. You’ve likely seen a few ridiculous headlines recently. One of the most recent, and most absurd, is that that OpenAI will pay Oracle $300 billion over four years, closely followed with the claim that NVIDIA will “invest” “$100 billion” in OpenAI to build 10GW of AI data centers, though the deal is structured in a way that means that OpenAI is paid “progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” and OpenAI will be leasing the chips (rather than buying them outright). I must be clear that these deals are intentionally made to continue the myth of generative AI, to pump NVIDIA, and to make sure OpenAI insiders can sell $10.3 billion of shares. OpenAI cannot afford the $300 billion, NVIDIA hasn’t sent OpenAI a cent and won’t do so if it can’t build the data centers, which OpenAI most assuredly can’t afford to do. NVIDIA needs this myth to continue, because in truth, all of these data centers are being built for demand that doesn’t exist, or that — if it exists — doesn’t necessarily translate into business customers paying huge amounts for access to OpenAI’s generative AI services. NVIDIA, OpenAI, CoreWeave and other AI-related companies hope that by announcing theoretical billions of dollars (or hundreds of billions of dollars) of these strange, vague and impossible-seeming deals, they can keep pretending that demand is there, because why else would they build all of these data centers, right? That, and the entire stock market rests on NVIDIA’s back. It accounts for 7% to 8% of the value of the S&P 500, and Jensen Huang needs to keep selling GPUs. I intend to explain later on how all of this works, and how brittle it really is. The intention of these deals is simple: to make you think “this much money can’t be wrong.” It can. These people need you to believe this is inevitable, but they are being proven wrong, again and again, and today I’m going to continue doing so. Underpinning these stories about huge amounts of money and endless opportunity lies a dark secret — that none of this is working, and all of this money has been invested in a technology that doesn’t make much revenue and loves to burn millions or billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. Over half a trillion dollars has gone into an entire industry without a single profitable company developing models or products built on top of models. By my estimates, there is around $44 billion of revenue in generative AI this year (when you add in Anthropic and OpenAI’s revenues to the pot, along with the other stragglers) and most of that number has been gathered through reporting from outlets like The Information, because none of these companies share their revenues, all of them lose shit tons of money, and their actual revenues are really, really small. Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue — Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported “$13 billion in annualized revenue,” so around $1.083 billion a month. Microsoft is a sales MACHINE. It is built specifically to create or exploit software markets, suffocating competitors by using its scale to drive down prices, and to leverage the ecosystem that it’s created over the past few decades. $1 billion a month in revenue is chump change for an organization that makes over $27 billion a quarter in PROFITS. Don’t worry Satya, I’ll come back to you later. “But Ed, the early days!” Worry not — I’ve got that covered. This is nothing like any other era of tech. There has never been this kind of cash-rush, even in the fiber boom. Over a decade, Amazon spent about one-tenth of the capex that the Magnificent Seven spent in two years on generative AI building AWS — something that now powers a vast chunk of the web, and has long been Amazon’s most profitable business unit. Generative AI is nothing like Uber, with OpenAI and Anthropic’s true costs coming in at about $159 billion in the past two years, approaching five times Uber’s $30 billion all-time burn. And that’s before the bullshit with NVIDIA and Oracle. Microsoft last reported AI revenue in January. It’s October this week. Why did it stop reporting this number, you think? Is it because the numbers are so good it couldn’t possibly let people know? As a general rule, publicly traded companies — especially those where the leadership are compensated primarily in equity — tend to brag about their successes, in part because said bragging boosts the value of the thing that the leadership gets paid in. There’s no benefit to being shy. Oracle literally made a regulatory filing to boast it had a $30 billion customer, which turned out to be OpenAI, who eventually agreed (publicly) to spend $300 billion in compute over five years. Which is to say that Microsoft clearly doesn’t have any good news to share, and as I’ll reveal later, they can’t even get 3% of their 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot. If Microsoft can’t sell this shit, nobody can. Anyway, I’m nearly done, sorry, you see, I’m writing this whole thing as if you’re brand new and walking up to this relatively unprepared, so I need to introduce another company. In 2020, a splinter group jumped off of OpenAI, funded by Amazon and Google to do much the same thing as OpenAI but pretend to be nicer about it until they have to raise from the Middle East. Anthropic has always been better at coding for some reason, and people really like its Claude models. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have become the only two companies in generative AI to make any real progress, either in terms of recognition or in sheer commercial terms, accounting for the majority of the revenue in the AI industry. In a very real sense, the AI industry’s revenue is OpenAI and Anthropic. In the year where Microsoft recorded $13bn in AI revenues, $10 billion came from OpenAI’s spending on Microsoft Azure. Anthropic burned $5.3 billion last year — with the vast majority of that going towards compute. Outside of these two companies, there’s barely enough revenue to justify a single data center. Where we sit today is a time of immense tension. Mark Zuckerberg says we’re in a bubble, Sam Altman says we’re in a bubble, Alibaba Chairman and billionaire Joe Tsai says we’re in a bubble, Apollo says we’re in a bubble, nobody is making money and nobody knows why they’re actually doing this anymore, just that they must do it immediately. And they have yet to make the case that generative AI warranted any of these expenditures. That was undoubtedly the longest introduction to a newsletter I’ve ever written, and the reason why I took my time was because this post demands a level of foreshadowing and exposition, and because I want to make it make sense to anyone who reads it — whether they’ve read my newsletter for years, or whether they’re only just now investigating their suspicions that generative AI may not be all it’s cracked up to be. Today I will make the case that generative AI’s fundamental growth story is flawed, and explain why we’re in the midst of an egregious bubble. This industry is sold by keeping things vague, and knowing that most people don’t dig much deeper than a headline, a problem I simply do not have. This industry is effectively in service of two companies — OpenAI and NVIDIA — who pump headlines out through endless contracts between them and subsidiaries or investments to give the illusion of activity. OpenAI is now, at this point, on the hook for over a trillion dollars, an egregious sum for a company that already forecast billions in losses, with no clear explanation as to how it’ll afford any of this beyond “we need more money” and the vague hope that there’s another Softbank or Microsoft waiting in the wings to swoop in and save the day. I’m going to walk you through where I see this industry today, and why I see no future for it beyond a fiery apocalypse. While everybody (reasonably!) harps on about hallucinations — which, to remind you, is when a model authoritatively states something that isn’t true — but the truth is far more complex, and far worse than it seems. You cannot rely on a large language model to do what you want. Even the most highly-tuned models on the most expensive and intricate platform can’t actually be relied upon to do exactly what you want. A “hallucination” isn’t just when these models say something that isn’t true. It’s when they decide to do something wrong because it seems the most likely thing to do, or when a coding model decides to go on a wild goose chase, failing the user and burning a ton of money in the process. The advent of “reasoning” models — those engineered to ‘think’ through problems in a way reminiscent of a human — and the expansion of what people are (trying) to use LLMs for demands that the definition of an AI hallucination be widened, not merely referring to factual errors, but fundamental errors in understanding the user’s request or intent, or what constitutes a task, in part because these models cannot think and do not know anything. However successful a model might be in generating something good *once*, it will also often generate something bad, or it’ll generate the right thing but in an inefficient and over-verbose fashion. You do not know what you’re going to get each time, and hallucinations multiply with the complexity of the thing you’re asking for, or whether a task contains multiple steps (which is a fatal blow to the idea of “agents.” You can add as many levels of intrigue and “reasoning” as you want, but Large Language Models cannot be trusted to do something correctly, or even consistently, every time. Model companies have successfully convinced everybody that the issue is that users are prompting the models wrong, and that people need to be “trained to use AI,” but what they’re doing is training people to explain away the inconsistencies of Large Language Models, and to assume individual responsibility for what is an innate flaw in how large language models work. Large Language Models are also uniquely expensive. Many mistakenly try and claim this is like the dot com boom or Uber, but the basic unit economics of generative AI are insane. Providers must purchase tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs each costing $50,000 a piece, and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of infrastructure for large clusters. And that’s without mentioning things like staffing, construction, power, or water. Then you turn them on and start losing money. Despite hundreds of billions of GPUs sold, nobody seems to make any money, other than NVIDIA, the company that makes them, and resellers like Dell and Supermicro who buy the GPUs, put them in servers, and sell them to other people. This arrangement works out great for Jensen Huang, and terribly for everybody else. I am going to explain the insanity of the situation we find ourselves in, and why I continue to do this work undeterred. The bubble has entered its most pornographic, aggressive and destructive stage, where the more obvious it becomes that they’re cooked, the more ridiculous the generative AI industry will act — a dark juxtaposition against every new study that says “generative AI does not work” or new story about ChatGPT’s uncanny ability to activate mental illness in people. So, let’s start simple: NVIDIA is a hardware company that sells GPUs, including the consumer GPUs that you’d see in a modern gaming PC, but when you read someone say “GPU” within the context of AI, they mean enterprise-focused GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and more modern GPUs like the Blackwell-series B200 and GB200 (which combines two GPUs with an NVIDIA CPU). These GPUs cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 (or as high as $70,000 for the newer Blackwell GPUs), and require tens of thousands of dollars more of infrastructure — networking to “cluster” server racks of GPUs together to provide compute, and massive cooling systems to deal with the massive amounts of heat they produce, as well as the servers themselves that they run on, which typically use top-of-the-line data center CPUs, and contain vast quantities of high-speed memory and storage. While the GPU itself is likely the most expensive single item within an AI server, the other costs — and I’m not even factoring in the actual physical building that the server lives in, or the water or electricity that it uses — add up. I’ve mentioned NVIDIA because it has a virtual monopoly in this space. Generative AI effectively requires NVIDIA GPUs, in part because it’s the only company really making the kinds of high-powered cards that generative AI demands, and because NVIDIA created something called CUDA — a collection of software tools that lets programmers write software that runs on GPUs, which were traditionally used primarily for rendering graphics in games. While there are open-source alternatives, as well as alternatives from Intel (with its ARC GPUs) and AMD (Nvidia’s main rival in the consumer space), these aren’t nearly as mature or feature-rich. Due to the complexities of AI models, one cannot just stand up a few of these things either — you need clusters of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of them for it to be worthwhile, making any investment in GPUs in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, especially considering they require completely different data center architecture to make them run. A common request — like asking a generative AI model to parse through thousands of lines of code and make a change or an addition — may use multiple of these $50,000 GPUs at the same time, and so if you aspire to serve thousands, or millions of concurrent users, you need to spend big. Really big. It’s these factors — the vendor lock-in, the ecosystem, and the fact that generative AI only works when you’re buying GPUs at scale — that underpin the rise of Nvidia. But beyond the economic and technical factors, there are human ones, too. To understand the AI bubble is to understand why CEOs do the things they do. Because an executive’s job is so vague, they can telegraph the value of their “labor” by spending money on initiatives and making partnerships. AI gave hyperscalers the excuse to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and buy a bunch of GPUs to go in them, because that, to the markets, looks like they’re doing something. By virtue of spending a lot of money in a frighteningly short amount of time, Satya Nadella received multiple glossy profiles, all without having to prove that AI can really do anything, be it a job or make Microsoft money. Nevertheless, AI allowed CEOs to look busy, and once the markets and journalists had agreed on the consensus opinion that “AI would be big,” all that these executives had to do was buy GPUs and “do AI.” We are in the midst of one of the darkest forms of software in history, described by many as an unwanted guest invading their products, their social media feeds, their bosses’ empty minds, and resting in the hands of monsters. Every story of its success feels bereft of any real triumph, with every literal description of its abilities involving multiple caveats about the mistakes it makes or the incredible costs of running it. Generative AI exists for two reasons: to cost money, and to make executives look busy. It was meant to be the new enterprise software and the new iPhone and the new Netflix all at once, a panacea where software guys pay one hardware guy for GPUs to unlock the incredible value creation of the future. Generative AI was always set up to fail, because it was meant to be everything, was talked about like it was everything, is still sold like it’s everything, yet for all the fucking hype, it all comes down to two companies: OpenAI, and, of course, NVIDIA. NVIDIA was, for a while, living high on the hog. All CEO Jensen Huang had to do every three months was saying “check out these numbers” and the markets and business journalists would squeal with glee, even as he said stuff like “the more you buy the more you save,” in part tipping his head to the (very real and sensible) idea of accelerated computing, but framed within the context of the cash inferno that’s generative AI, seems ludicrous. Huang’s showmanship worked really well for NVIDIA for a while, because for a while the growth was easy. Everybody was buying GPUs. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (and to a lesser extent Apple and Tesla) make up 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue, creating, at least for the first four, a degree of shared mania where everybody justified buying tens of billions of dollars of GPUs a year by saying “the other guy is doing it!” This is one of the major reasons the AI bubble is happening, because people conflated NVIDIA’s incredible sales with “interest in AI,” rather than everybody buying GPUs. Don’t worry, I’ll explain the revenue side a little bit later. We’re here for the long haul. Anyway, NVIDIA is facing a problem — that the only thing that grows forever is cancer. On September 9 2025, the Wall Street Journal said that NVIDIA’s “wow” factor was fading, going from beating analyst estimates in by nearly 21% in its Fiscal Year Q2 2024 earnings to scraping by with a mere 1.52% beat in its most-recent earnings — something that for any other company, would be a good thing, but framed against the delusional expectations that generative AI has inspired, is a figure that looks nothing short of ominous. Per the Wall Street Journal: In any other scenario, 56% year-over-year growth would lead to an abundance of Dom Perignon and Huang signing hundreds of boobs, but this is NVIDIA, and that’s just not good enough. Back in February 2024, NVIDIA was booking 265% year-over-year growth, but in its February 2025 earnings, NVIDIA only grew by a measly 78% year-over-year. It isn’t so much that NVIDIA isn’t growing, but that to grow year-over-year at the rates that people expect is insane. Life was a lot easier when NVIDIA went from $6.05 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2023 to $22 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2024, but for it to grow even 55% year-over-year from Q2 FY2026 ($46.7 billion) to Q2 2027 would require it to make $72.385 billion in revenue in the space of three months, mostly from selling GPUs (which make up around 88% of its revenue). This would put Nvidia in the ballpark of Microsoft ($76 billion in the last quarter) and within the neighborhood of Apple ($94 billion in the last quarter), predominantly making money in an industry that a year-and-a-half ago barely made the company $6 billion in a quarter. And the market needs NVIDIA to perform, as the company makes up 8% of the value of the S&P 500. It’s not enough for it to be wildly profitable, or have a monopsony on selling GPUs, or for it to have effectively 10x’d their stock in a few years. It must continue to grow at the fastest rate of anything ever, making more and more money selling these GPUs to a small group of companies that immediately start losing money once they plug them in. While a few members of the Magnificent Seven could be depended on to funnel tens of billions of dollars into a furnace each quarter, there were limits, even for companies like Microsoft, which had bought over 485,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. To take a step back, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make their money by either selling access to Large Language Models that people incorporate into their products, or by renting out servers full of GPUs to run inference (as said previously, the process to generate an output by a model or series of models) or train AI models for companies that develop and market models themselves, namely Anthropic and OpenAI. The latter revenue stream of which is where Jensen Huang found a solution to that eternal growth problem: the neocloud, namely CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius. These businesses are fairly straightforward. They own (or lease) data centers that they then fill full of servers that are full of NVIDIA GPUs, which they then rent on an hourly basis to customers, either on a per-GPU basis or in large batches for larger customers, who guarantee they'll use a certain amount of compute and sign up to long-term (i.e. more than an hour at a time) commitments. A neocloud is a specialist cloud compute company that exists only to provide access to GPUs for AI, unlike Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which have healthy businesses selling other kinds of compute, with AI (as I’ll get into later) failing to provide much of a return on investment. It’s not just the fact that these companies are more specialized than, say, Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft Azure. As you’ve gathered from the name, these are new, young, and in almost all cases, incredibly precarious businesses — each with financial circumstances that would make a Greek finance minister blush. That’s because setting up a neocloud is expensive. Even if the company in question already has data centers — as CoreWeave did with its cryptocurrency mining operation — AI requires completely new data center infrastructure to house and cool the GPUs, and those GPUs also need paying for, and then there’s the other stuff I mentioned earlier, like power, water, and the other bits of the computer (the CPU, the motherboard, the memory and storage, and the housing). As a result, these neoclouds are forced to raise billions of dollars in debt, which they collateralize using the GPUs they already have, along with contracts from customers, which they use to buy more GPUs. CoreWeave, for example, has $25 billion in debt on estimated revenues of $5.35 billion, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. You know who also invests in these neoclouds? NVIDIA! NVIDIA is also one of CoreWeave’s largest customers (accounting for 15% of its revenue in 2024), and just signed a deal to buy $6.3 billion of any capacity that CoreWeave can’t otherwise sell to someone else through 2032, an extension of a $1.3 billion 2023 deal reported by the Information. It was the anchor investor ($250 million) in CoreWeave’s IPO, too. NVIDIA is currently doing the same thing with Lambda, another neocloud that NVIDIA invested in, which also plans to go public next year. NVIDIA is also one of Lambda’s largest customers, signing a deal with it this summer to rent 10,000 GPUs for $1.3 billion over four years. In the UK, NVIDIA has just invested $700 million in Nscale, a former crypto miner that has never built an AI data center, and that has, despite having no experience, committed $1 billion (and/or 100,000 GPUs) to an OpenAI data center in Norway. On Thursday, September 25, Nscale announced it had closed another funding round, with NVIDIA listed as a main backer — although it’s unclear how much money it put in. It would be safe to assume it’s another few hundred million. NVIDIA also invested in Nebius, an outgrowth of Russian conglomerate Yandex, and Nebius provides, through a partnership with NVIDIA, tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of compute credits to companies in NVIDIA’s Inception startup program. NVIDIA’s plan is simple: fund these neoclouds, let these neoclouds load themselves up with debt, at which point they buy GPUs from NVIDIA, which can then be used as collateral for loans, along with contracts from customers, allowing the neoclouds to buy even more GPUs. It’s like that Robinhood infinite money glitch… …except, that is, for one small problem. There don’t appear to be that many customers. As I went into recently on my premium newsletter, NVIDIA funds and sustains Neoclouds as a way of funnelling revenue to itself, as well as partners like Supermicro and Dell, resellers that take NVIDIA GPUs and put them in servers to sell pre-built to customers. These two companies made up 39% of NVIDIA’s revenues last quarter. Yet when you remove hyperscaler revenue — Microsoft, Amazon, Google, OpenAI and NVIDIA — from the revenues of these neoclouds, there’s barely $1 billion in revenue combined, across CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda. CoreWeave’s $5.35 billion revenue is predominantly made up of its contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft (offering compute for OpenAI), Google (hiring CoreWeave to offer compute for OpenAI), and OpenAI itself, which has promised CoreWeave $22.4 billion in business over the next few years. This is all a lot of stuff, so I’ll make it really simple: there is no real money in offering AI compute, but that isn’t Jensen Huang’s problem, so he will simply force NVIDIA to hand money to these companies so that they have contracts to point to when they raise debt to buy more NVIDIA GPUs. Neoclouds are effectively giant private equity vehicles that exist to raise money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, or for hyperscalers to move money around so that they don’t increase their capital expenditures and can, as Microsoft did earlier in the year, simply walk away from deals they don’t like. Nebius’ “$17.4 billion deal” with Microsoft even included a clause in its 6-K filing that Microsoft can terminate the deal in the event the capacity isn’t built by the delivery dates, and Nebius has already used the contract to raise $3 billion to… build the data center to provide compute for the contract. Here, let me break down the numbers: From my analysis, it appears that CoreWeave, despite expectations to make that $5.35 billion this year, has only around $500 million of non-Magnificent Seven or OpenAI AI revenue in 2025, with Lambda estimated to have around $100 million in AI revenue, and Nebius around $250 million without Microsoft’s share, and that’s being generous. In simpler terms, the Magnificent Seven is the AI bubble, and the AI bubble exists to buy more GPUs, because (as I’ll show) there’s no real money or growth coming out of this, other than in the amount that private credit is investing — “$50 billion a quarter, for the low end, for the past three quarters.” I dunno man, let’s start simple: $50 billion a quarter of data center funding is going into an industry that has less revenue than Genshin Impact. That feels pretty bad. Who’s gonna use these data centers? How are they going to even make money on them? Private equity firms don’t typically hold onto assets, they sell them or take them public. Doesn’t seem great to me! Anyway, if AI was truly the next big growth vehicle, neoclouds would be swimming in diverse global revenue streams. Instead, they’re heavily-centralized around the same few names, one of which (NVIDIA) directly benefits from their existence not as a company doing business, but as an entity that can accrue debt and spend money on GPUs. These Neoclouds are entirely dependent on a continual flow of private credit from firms like Goldman Sachs (Nebius, CoreWeave, Lambda for its IPO), JPMorgan (Lambda, Crusoe, CoreWeave), and Blackstone (Lambda, CoreWeave), who have in a very real sense created an entire debt-based infrastructure to feed billions of dollars directly to NVIDIA, all in the name of an AI revolution that's yet to arrive. The fact that the rest of the neocloud revenue stream is effectively either a hyperscaler or OpenAI is also concerning. Hyperscalers are, at this point, the majority of data center capital expenditures, and have yet to prove any kind of success from building out this capacity, outside, of course, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which has succeeded in generating revenue while burning billions of dollars. Hyperscaler revenue is also capricious, but even if it isn’t, why are there no other major customers? Why, across all of these companies, does there not seem to be one major customer who isn’t OpenAI? The answer is obvious: nobody that wants it can afford it, and those who can afford it don’t need it. It’s also unclear what exactly hyperscalers are doing with this compute, because it sure isn’t “making money.” While Microsoft makes $10 billion in revenue from renting compute to OpenAI via Microsoft Azure, it does so at-cost, and was charging OpenAI $1.30-per-hour for each A100GPU it rents, a loss of $2.2 an hour per GPU, meaning that it is likely losing money on this compute, especially as SemiAnalysis has the total cost per hour per GPU at around $1.46 with the cost of capital and debt associated for a hyperscaler, though it’s unclear if that’s for an H100 or A100 GPU. In any case, how do these neoclouds pay for their debt if the hyperscalers give up, or NVIDIA doesn’t send them money, or, more likely, private credit begins to notice that there’s no real revenue growth outside of circular compute deals with neoclouds’ largest supplier, investor and customer? They don’t! In fact, I have serious concerns that they can’t even build the capacity necessary to fulfil these deals, but nobody seems to worry about that. No, really! It appears to be taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of compute capacity. How exactly are any of these neoclouds (or Oracle itself) able to expand to actually capture this revenue? Who knows! But I assume somebody is going to say “OpenAI!” Here’s an insane statistic for you: OpenAI will account for — in both its own revenue (projected $13 billion) and in its own compute costs ($16 billion, according to The Information, although that figure is likely out of date, and seemingly only includes the compute it’ll use, and not that it has committed to build, and thus has spent money on) — about 50% of all AI revenues in 2025. That figure takes into account the $400m ARR for ServiceNow, Adobe, and Salesforce; the $35bn in revenue for the Magnificent Seven from AI (not profit, and based on figures from the previous year); revenue from neoclouds like CoreWeave, Nebius, and Lambda; and the estimated revenue from the entire generative AI industry (including Anthropic and other smaller players, like Perplexity and Anysphere) for a total of $55bn.OpenAI is the generative AI industry — and it’s a dog of a company. As a reminder, OpenAI has leaked that it’ll burn $115 billion in the next four years, and based on my estimates, it needs to raise more than $290 billion in the next four years based on its $300 billion deal with Oracle alone. That alone is a very, very bad sign, especially as we’re three years and $500 billion or more into this hype cycle with few signs of life outside of, well, OpenAI promising people money. Credit to Anthony Restaino for this horrifying graphic: This is not what a healthy, stable industry looks like. Alright, well, things can’t be that bad on the software side. Right? Right? As I covered on my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, everybody is losing money on generative AI, in part because the cost of running AI models is increasing, and in part because the software itself doesn’t do enough to warrant the costs associated with running them, which are already subsidized and unprofitable for the model providers. Outside of OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Anthropic), nobody seems to be making much revenue, with the most “successful” company being Anysphere, makers of AI coding tool Cursor, which hit $500 million ‘annualized” (so $41.6 million in one month) a few months ago, just before Anthropic and OpenAI jacked up the prices for “priority processing” on enterprise queries, raising its operating costs as a result. In any case, that’s some piss-poor revenue for an industry that’s meant to be the future of software. Smartwatches are projected to make $32 billion this year, and as mentioned, the Magnificent Seven expects to make $35 billion or so in revenue from AI this year. Even Anthropic and OpenAI seem a little lethargic, both burning billions of dollars while making, by my estimates, no more than $2 billion and $6.26 billion in 2025 so far, despite projections of $5 billion and $13 billion respectively. Outside of these two, AI startups are floundering, struggling to stay alive and raising money in several-hundred million dollar bursts as their negative-gross-margin businesses flounder. As I dug into a few months ago, I could find only 12 AI-powered companies making more than $8.3 million a month, with two of them slightly improving their revenues, specifically AI search company Perplexity (which has now hit $150 million ARR, or $12.5 million in a month) and AI coding startup Replit (which also hit $150 million ARR in September). Both of these companies burn ridiculous amounts of money. Perplexity burned 164% of its revenue on Amazon Web Services, OpenAI and Anthropic last year, and while Replit hasn’t leaked its costs, The Information reports its gross margins in July were 23%, which doesn’t include the costs of its free users, which you simply have to do with LLMs as free users are capable of costing you a hell of a lot of money. Problematically, your paid users can also cost you more than they bring in as well. In fact, every user loses you money in generative AI, because it’s impossible to do cost control in a consistent manner. A few months ago, I did a piece about Anthropic losing money on every single Claude Code subscriber, and I’ll walk you through it in a very simplified fashion: Anthropic is, to be clear, the second-largest model developer, and has some of the best AI talent in the industry. It has a better handle on its infrastructure than anyone outside of big tech and OpenAI. It still cannot seem to fix this problem, even with weekly rate limits. While one could assume that Anthropic is simply letting people run wild, my theory is far simpler: even the model developers have no real way of limiting user activity, likely due to the architecture of generative AI. I know it sounds insane, but at the most advanced level, model providers are still prompting their models, and whatever rate limits may be in place appear to, at times, get completely ignored, and there doesn’t seem to be anything they can do to stop it. No, really. Anthropic counts amongst its capitalist apex predators one lone Chinese man who spent $50,000 of their compute in the space of a month fucking around with Claude Code. Even if Anthropic was profitable — it isn’t, and will burn billions this year — a customer paying $200-a-month running up $50,000 in costs immediately devours the margin of any user running the service that day, if not that week or month. Even if Anthropic’s costs are half the published rates, one guy amounted to 125 users’ monthly revenue. That’s not a real business! That’s a bad business with out-of-control costs, and it doesn’t appear anybody has these costs under control. A few weeks ago, Replit — an unprofitable AI coding company — released a product called “Agent 3.” which promised to be “10x more autonomous” and offer “infinitely more possibilities,” “[testing] and [fixing] its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop.” In reality, this means you’d go and tell the model to build something and it would “go do it,” and you’ll be shocked to hear that these models can’t be relied upon to “go and do” anything. Please note that this was launched a few months after Replit raised its prices, shifting to obfuscated “effort-based” pricing that would charge “the full scope of the agent’s work.” Agent 3 has been a disaster. Users found tasks that previously cost a few dollars were spiralling into the hundreds of dollars, with The Register reporting one customer found themselves with a $1000 bill after a week: Another user complained that “costs skyrocketed, without any concrete results”: As I previously reported, in late May/early June, both OpenAI and Anthropic cranked up the pricing on their enterprise customers, leading to Replit and Cursor both shifting their prices. This abuse has now trickled down to their customers. Replit has now released an update that lets you choose how autonomous you want Agent 3 to be, which is a tacit admission that you can’t trust coding LLMs to build software. Replit’s users are still pissed off, complaining that Replit is charging them for activity when the agent doesn’t do anything, a consistent problem across its Reddit. While Reddit is not the full summation of all users across every company, it’s a fairly good barometer of user sentiment, and man, are users pissy. Traditionally, Silicon Valley startups have relied upon the same model of “grow really fast and burn a bunch of money, then “turn the profit lever.” AI does not have a “profit lever,” because the raw costs of providing access to AI models are so high (and they’re only increasing) that the basic economics of how the tech industry sells software don’t make sense. I’ll reiterate something I wrote a few weeks ago: In simpler terms, it is very, very difficult to imagine what one user — free or otherwise — might cost, and thus it’s hard to charge them on a monthly basis, or tell them what a service might cost them on average. This is a huge problem with AI coding environments. According to The Information, Claude Code was driving “nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from a few weeks ago” on July 31 2025. That annualized revenue works out to about $33 million a month in revenue for a company that predicts it will make at least $416 million a month by the end of the year, and for a product that has become the most-popular coding environment in the world, from the second-largest and best-funded AI company in the world. …is that it? Is that all that’s happening here? $33 million dollars, all of it unprofitable, after it felt, at least based on social media chatter and discussing with multiple different software engineers, that Claude Code had become ubiquitous with anything to do with LLMs. To be clear, Anthropic’s Sonnet and Opus models are consistently some of the most popular for programming on Openrouter, an aggregator of LLM usage, and Anthropic has been consistently-named as “the best at coding.” Some bright spark out there is going to say that Microsoft’s Github Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and guess what, that’s true, and in fact, I reported it! Here’s another fun fact: the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft loses “on average more than $20-a-month-per-user,” with “...some users [costing] the company as much as $80.” And that’s for the most-popular product! If you believe the New York Times or other outlets that simply copy and paste whatever Dario Amodei says, you’d think that the reason that software engineers are having trouble finding work is because their jobs are being replaced by AI. This grotesque, abusive, manipulative and offensive lie has been propagated throughout the entire business and tech media without anybody sitting down and asking whether it’s true, or even getting a good understanding of what it is that LLMs can actually do with code. Members of the media, I am begging you, stop doing this. I get it, every asshole is willing to give a quote saying that “coding is dead,” and that every executive is willing to burp out some nonsense about replacing all of their engineers, but I am fucking begging you to either use these things yourself, or speak to people that do. I am not a coder. I cannot write or read code. Nevertheless, I am capable of learning, and have spoken to numerous software engineers in the last few months, and basically reached a consensus of “this is kind of useful, sometimes.” However, one very silly man once said that I don’t speak to people who use these tools, so I went and spoke to three notable, experienced software engineers, and asked them to give me the straight truth about what coding LLMs can do. In simple terms, LLMs are capable of writing code, but can’t do software engineering, because software engineering is the process of understanding, maintaining and executing code to produce functional software, and LLMs do not “learn,” cannot “adapt,” and (to paraphrase Brown), break down the more of your code and variables you ask them to look at at once. It’s very easy to believe that software engineering is just writing code, but the reality is that software engineers maintain software, which includes writing and analyzing code among a vast array of different personalities and programs and problems. Good software engineering harkens back to Brian Merchant’s interviews with translators — while some may believe that translators simply tell you what words mean, true translation is communicating the meaning of a sentence, which is cultural, contextual, regional, and personal, and often requires the exercise of creativity and novel thinking. My editor, Matthew Hughes, gave an example of this in his newsletter: Similarly, coding is not just “a series of text that programs a computer,” but a series of interconnected characters that refers to other software in other places that must also function now and explain, on some level, to someone who has never, ever seen the code before, why it was done this way. This is, by the way, why we are still yet to get any tangible proof that AI is replacing software engineers…because it can’t. Of all the fields supposedly at risk from “AI disruption,” coding feels (or felt) the most tangible, if only because the answer to “can you write code with LLMs” wasn’t an immediate, unilateral no. The media has also been quick to say that AI “writes software,” which is true in the same way that ChatGPT “writes novels”. In reality, LLMs can generate code, and do some software engineering-adjacent tasks, but, like all Large Language Models, break down and go totally insane, hallucinating more as the tasks get more complex. And, as I pointed out earlier, software engineering is not just coding. It involves thinking about problems, finding solutions to novel challenges, designing stuff in a way that can be read and maintained by others, and that’s (ideally) scalable and secure. The whole fucking point of an “AI” is that you hand shit off to it! That’s what they’ve been selling it as! That’s why Jensen Huang told kids to stop learning to code, as with AI, there’s no point. And it was all a lie. Generative AI can’t do the job of a software engineer, and it fails while also costing abominable amounts of money. Coding LLMs seem like magic at first, because they (to quote a conversation with Carl Brown) make the easy things easier, but they also make the harder things harder. They don’t even speed up engineers — they actually make them slower! Yet coding is basically the only obvious use case for LLMs. I’m sure you’re gonna say “but I bet the enterprise is doing well!” and you are so very, very wrong. Before I go any further, let’s establish some facts: All of this is to say that Microsoft has one of the largest commercial software empires in history, thousands (if not tens of thousands) of salespeople, and thousands of companies that literally sell Microsoft services for a living. And it can’t sell AI. A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers. This would amount to, if each of these users paid annually at the full rate of $30-a-month, to about $2.88 billion in annual revenue for a product category that makes $33 billion a fucking quarter. And I must be clear, I am 100% sure these users aren’t all paying $30 a month. The Information reported a few weeks ago that Microsoft has been “reducing the software’s price with more generous discounts on the AI features, according to customers and salespeople,” heavily suggesting discounts had already been happening. Enterprise software is traditionally sold at a discount anyway — or, put a different way, with bulk pricing for those who sign up a bunch of users at once. In fact, I’ve found evidence that it’s been doing this a while, with a 15% discount on annual Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions for orders of 10-to-300 seats mentioned by an IT consultant back in late 2024, and another that’s currently running through September 30, 2025 through Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider program, with up to 2400 licenses discounted if you pay upfront for the year. Microsoft seems to do this a lot, as I found another example of an offer that ran from January 1 2025 through March 31 2025. An “active” user is someone who has taken one action on Copilot in any Microsoft 365 app in the space of 28 days. Now, I know. That word, active. Maybe you’re thinking “Ed, this is like the gym model! There are unpaid licenses that Microsoft is getting paid for!” Fine! Let’s assume that Microsoft also has, based on research that suggests this is the case for all software companies, another 50% — four million — of paid Copilot licenses that aren’t being used. That still makes this 12 million users, which is still a putrid 2.72% conversion rate. So, why aren’t people paying for Copilot? Let’s hear from someone who talked to The Information: Microsoft 365 Copilot has been such a disaster that Microsoft will now integrate Anthropic’s models in an attempt and make them better. Oh, one other thing: sources also confirm GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%. I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August. So, The Information reported a few months ago that Microsoft’s projected AI revenues would be $13 billion, with $10 billion of that from OpenAI, leaving about $3 billion of total revenue across Microsoft 365 Copilot and any other foreseeable feature that Microsoft sells with “AI” on it. This heavily suggests that Microsoft is making somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on Azure or Microsoft 365 Copilot, though I suppose there are other places it could be making AI revenue too. Right? I guess. In any case, Microsoft’s net income (read: profit) in its last quarterly earnings was $27.2 billion. Pathetic. One of the comfortable lies that people tell themselves is that the AI bubble is similar to the fiber boom, or the dot com bubble, or Uber, or that we’re in the “growth stage,” or that “this is what software companies do, they spend a bunch of money then “pull the profit lever.” This is nothing like anything you’ve seen before, because this is the dumbest shit that the tech industry has ever done. AI data centers are nothing like fiber, because there are very few actual use cases for these GPUs outside of AI, and none of them are remotely hyperscale revenue drivers. As I discussed a month or so ago, data center development accounted for more of America’s GDP growth than all consumer spending combined, and there really isn’t any demand for AI in general, let alone at the scale that these hundreds of billions of dollars are being sunk into. The conservative estimate of capital expenditures related to data centers is around $400 billion, but given the $50 billion a quarter in private credit, I’m going to guess it breaks $500 billion, all to build capacity for an industry yet to prove itself. And this NVIDIA-OpenAI “$100 billion funding” news should only fill you full of dread, but also it isn’t fucking finalized, stop reporting it as if it’s done, I swear to god- Anyway, according to CNBC, “the initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized,” with “successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company’s then-current valuation as new capacity comes online.” At no point is anyone asking how, exactly, OpenAI builds data centers to fill full of these GPUs. In fact, I am genuinely shocked (and a little disgusted!) by how poorly this story has been told. Let’s go point by point: To be clear, when I say OpenAI needs at least $300 billion over the next four years, that’s if you believe its projections, which you shouldn’t. Let’s walk through its (alleged) numbers, while plagiarizing myself: According to The Information, here's the breakdown (these are projections): OpenAI's current reported burn is $116 billion through 2030, which means there is no way that these projections include $300 billion in compute costs, even when you factor in revenue. There is simply no space in these projections to absorb that $300 billion, and from what I can tell, by 2029, OpenAI will have actually burned more than $290 billion, assuming that it survives that long, which I do not believe it will. Don’t worry, though. OpenAI is about to make some crazy money. Here are the projections that CFO Sarah Friar signed off on: Just so we are clear, OpenAI intends to 10x its revenue in the space of four years, selling software and access to models in an industry with about $60 billion of revenue in 2025. How will it do this? It doesn’t say. I don’t know OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, but I do know that signing off on these numbers is, at the very least, ethically questionable. Putting aside the ridiculousness of OpenAI’s deals, or its funding requirements, Friar has willfully allowed Sam Altman and OpenAI to state goals that defy reality or good sense, all to take advantage of investors and public markets that have completely lost the plot. I need to be blunter: OpenAI has signed multiple different deals and contracts for amounts it cannot afford to pay, that it cannot hope to raise the money to pay for, that defy the amounts of venture capital and private credit available, all to sustain a company that will burn $300 billion and has no path to profitability of any kind. So, as I said above, CNBC reported on September 23, 2025 that the NVIDIA deal will be delivered in $10 billion tranches, the first of which is “expected to close within a month,” and the rest delivered “as new capacity comes online.” This is, apparently, all part of a plan to build 10GW of data center capacity with NVIDIA. A few key points: So, let’s start simple: data centers take forever to build. As I said previously, based on current reports, it’s taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of data center capacity, and nowhere in these reports does one reporter take a second to say “hey, what data centers are you talking about?” or “hey, didn’t Sam Altman say back in July that he was building 10GW of data center capacity with Oracle?” But wait, now Oracle and OpenAI have done another announcement that says they’re only doing 7GW, but they’re “ahead of schedule” on 10GW? Wait, is NVIDIA’s 10GW the same 10GW as Oracle and OpenAI are working on? Is it different? Nobody seems to know or care! Anyway, I cannot be clear enough how unlikely it is that (as NVIDIA has said) “the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026,” and that’s if it has bought the land and got the permits and ordered the construction, none of which has happened yet. But let’s get really specific on costs! Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI is a $15 billion joint venture, which means a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion. Abilene’s eight buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs. Though this math is a little funky due to NVIDIA promising to install its new Rubin GPUs in these theoretical data centers, that means these data centers will require a little under $200 billion worth of GPUs. By my maths that’s $325 billion. I’m so tired of this. A number of you have sent me the following image with some sort of comment about how “this is how it’ll work,” and you are wrong, because this is neither how it works nor how it will work nor accurate on any level. In the current relationship, NVIDIA Is Not Sending OpenAI $100 Billion, nor will it send it that much money, because 90% of OpenAI’s funding is gated behind building 9 or 10 gigawatts of data center capacity. In the current relationship, OpenAI does not have the money to pay Oracle. Also, can Oracle even afford to give that much money to NVIDIA? It had negative free cash flow last quarter, already has $104 billion in debt, and its biggest new customer cannot afford a single fucking thing it’s promised. The only company in this diagram that actually can afford to do any of this shit is NVIDIA, and even then it only has $56 billion cash on hand. In any case, as I went over on Friday, OpenAI has promised about a trillion dollars between compute contracts across Oracle, Microsoft, Google and CoreWeave, 17 Gigawatts of promised data centers in America between NVIDIA and “Stargate,” several more gigawatts of international data centers, custom chips from Broadcom, and their own company operations. How exactly does this get paid for? Nobody seems to ask these questions! Why am I the asshole doing this? Don’t we have tech analysts that are meant to analyse shit? AHhhhh- Every time I sit down to write about this subject the newsletters seem to get longer, because people are so painfully attached to the norms and tropes of the past. This post is, already, 17,500 words — a record for this newsletter — and I’ve still not finished editing and expanding it. What we’re witnessing is one of the most egregious wastes of capital in history, sold by career charlatans with their reputations laundered by a tech and business media afraid to criticize the powerful and analysts that don’t seem to want to tell their investors the truth. There are no historic comparisons here — even Britain’s abominable 1800s railway bubble, which absorbed half of the country’s national income, created valuable infrastructure for trains, a vehicle that can move people to and from places. GPUs are not trains, nor are they cars, or even CPUs. They are not adaptable to many other kinds of work, nor are they “the infrastructure of the future of tech,” because they’re already quite old and with everybody focused on buying them, you’d absolutely see one other use case by now that actually mattered. GPUs are expensive, power-hungry, environmentally destructive and require their own kinds of cooling and server infrastructure, making every GPU data center and environmental and fiscal bubble unto themselves. And, whereas the Victorian train infrastructure still exists in the UK — though it has been upgraded over the years — a GPU has a limited useful lifespan. These are cards that can — and will — break after a period of extended usage, whether that period is five years or later, and they’ll inevitably be superseded by something better and more powerful, meaning that the resale value of that GPU will only go down, with a price depreciation that’s akin to a new car. I am telling you, as I have been telling you for years, again and again and again, that the demand is not there for generative AI, and the demand is never, ever arriving. The only reason anyone humours any of this crap is the endless hoarding of GPUs to build capacity for a revolution that will never arrive. Well, that and OpenAI, a company built and sold on lies about ChatGPT’s capabilities. ChatGPT’s popularity — and OpenAI’s hunger for endless amounts of compute — have created the illusion of demand due to the sheer amount of capacity required to keep their services operational, all so they can burn $8 billion or more in 2025 and, if my estimates are right, nearly a trillion dollars by 2030. This NVIDIA deal is a farce — an obvious attempt by the largest company on the American stock market to prop up the one significant revenue-generator in the entire industry, knowing that time is running out for it to create new avenues for eternal growth. I’d argue that NVIDIA’s deal also shows the complete contempt that these companies have for the media. There are no details about how this deal works beyond the initial $10 billion, there’s no land purchased, no data center construction started, and yet the media slurps it down without a second thought. I am but one man, and I am fucking peculiar. I did not learn financial analysis in school, but I appear to be one of the few people doing even the most basic analysis of these deals, and while I’m having a great time doing so, I am also exceedingly frustrated at how little effort is being put into prying apart these deals. I realize how ridiculous all of this sounds. I get it. There’s so much money being promised to so many people, market rallies built off the back of massive deals, and I get that the assumption is that this much money can’t be wrong, that this many people wouldn’t just say stuff without intending to follow through, or without considering whether their company could afford it. I know it’s hard to conceive that hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested in something for no apparent reason, but it’s happening, right god damn now, in front of your eyes, and I am going to be merciless on anyone who attempts to write a “how could we see this coming?” Generative AI has never been reliable, has always been unprofitable, and has always been unsustainable, and I’ve been saying so since February 2024. The economics have never made sense, something I’ve said repeatedly since April 2024, and when I wrote “How Does OpenAI Survive?” in July 2024, I had multiple people suggest I was being alarmist. Here’s some alarmism for you: the longer it takes for OpenAI to die, the more damage it will cause to the tech industry. On Friday, when I put out my piece on OpenAI needing a trillion dollars, I asked analyst Gil Luria if the capital was there to build the 17 Gigawatts that OpenAI had allegedly planned to build. He said the following: That doesn’t sound good! Anyway, as I discussed earlier, venture capital could run out in six quarters, with investor and researcher Jon Sakoda estimating that there will only be around $164 billion of dry powder (available capital) in US VC firms by the end of 2025. In July, The French Tech Journal reported (using Pitchbook data) that global venture capital deal activity reached its lowest first-half total since 2018, with $139.4 billion in deal value in the first half of 2025, down from $183.4 billion in the first half of 2024, meaning that any further expansion or demands for venture capital from OpenAI will likely sap the dwindling funds available from other startups. Things get worse when you narrow things to US venture capital. In a piece from April, EY reported that VC-backed investment in US companies hit $80 billion in Q1 2025, but “one $40 billion deal” accounted for half of the investment — OpenAI’s $40 billion deal of which only $10 billion has actually closed, and that didn’t happen until fucking June. Without the imaginary money from OpenAI, US venture would have declined by 36%. The longer that OpenAI survives, the longer it will sap the remaining billions from the tech ecosystem, and I expect it to extend its tendrils to private credit too. The $325 billion it needs just to fulfil its NVIDIA contract, albeit over 4 years, is an egregious sum that I believe exceeds the available private capital in the world. Let’s get specific, and check out the top 10 private equity firms’ available capital! Assuming that all of this capital is currently available, the top 10 private equity firms in the world have around $477 billion of available capital. We can, of course, include investment banks — Goldman Sachs had around $520 billion cash in hand available at the end of its last quarter, and JPMorgan over $1.7 trillion, but JP Morgan has only dedicated $50 billion in direct lending commitments as of February 2025, and while Goldman Sachs expanded its direct private credit lending by $15 billion back in June, that appears to be an extension of its “more than $20 billion” direct lending close from mid-2024. Include both of those, and that brings us up to — if we assume that all of these funds are available — $562 billion in capital and about $164 billion in US venture available to spend, and that’s meant to go to more places than just OpenAI. Sure, sure, there’s more than just the top 10 private equity firms and there’s venture money outside of the US, but what could it be? Like, another $150 billion? You see, OpenAI needs to buy those GPUs, and it needs to build those data centers, and it needs to pay its thousands of staff and marketing and sales costs too. While OpenAI likely wouldn’t be the ones raising the money for the data centers — and honestly, I’m not sure who would do it at this point? — somebody is going to need to build TWENTY GIGAWATTS OF DATA CENTERS if we’re to believe both Oracle and NVIDIA You may argue that venture funds and private credit can raise more, and you’re right! But at this point, there have been few meaningful acquisitions of AI companies, and zero exits from the billions of dollars put into data centers. Even OpenAI admits in its own announcement about new Stargate sites that this will be a “$400 billion investment over 3 years.” Where the fuck is that money coming from? Is OpenAI really going to absorb massive chunks of all available private credit and venture capital for the next few years? And no, god, stop saying the US government will bail this out. It will have to bail out hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no scenario where it’s anything less than that, and I’ve already been over this. While the US government has spent equivalent sums in the past to support private business (the total $440 billion dispersed during the Great Recession’s TARP program, where the Treasury bought toxic assets from investment banks to stop them from imploding a la Lehman, springs to mind), it’s hard to imagine any case where OpenAI is seen as vital to the global financial system — and the economic health of the US — as the banking system. Sure, we spent around $1tn — if we’re being specific, $953bn — on the Paycheck Protection Program during the Covid era, but that was to keep people employed at a time when the economy outside of Zoom and Walmart had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist. There was an urgency that doesn’t apply here. If OpenAI goes tits up, Softbank loses some money — nothing new there — and Satya Nadella has to explain why he spent tens of billions of dollars on a bunch of data centers filled with $50,000 GPUs that are, at this point, ornamental. And while there will be — and have been — disastrous economic consequences, they won’t be as systemically catastrophic as that of the pandemic, or the global financial crisis. To be clear, it’ll be bad, but not as bad. And there’s also the problem of moral hazard — if the government steps in, what’s to stop big tech chasing its next fruitless rainbow? — and optics. If people resented bailing out the banks after they acted like profligate gamblers and lost, how will they feel bailing out fucking Sam Altman and Jensen Huang? I do apologize for the length of this piece, but the significance of this bubble requires depth. There is little demand, little real money, and little reason to continue, and the sheer lack of responsibility and willingness to kneel before the powerful fills me full of angry bile. I understand many journalists are not in a position where they can just write “this shit sounds stupid,” but we have entered a deeply stupid era, and by continuing to perpetuate the myth of AI, the media guarantees that retail investors and regular people’s 401Ks will suffer. It is now inevitable that this bubble bursts. Deutsche Bank has said the AI boom is unsustainable outside of tech spending “remaining parabolic,” which it says “is highly unlikely,” and Bain Capital has said that $2 trillion in new revenue is needed to fund AI’s scaling, and even that math is completely fucked as it talks about “AI-related savings”: Even when stared in the face by a ridiculous idea — $2 trillion of new revenue in a global software market that’s expected to be around $817 billion in 2025 — Bain still oinks out some nonsense about the “savings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support and R&D,” yet another myth perpetuated I assume to placate the fucking morons sinking billions into this. Every single “vibe coding is the future,” “the power of AI,” and “AI job loss” story written perpetuates a myth that will only lead to more regular people getting hurt when the bubble bursts. Every article written about OpenAI or NVIDIA or Oracle that doesn’t explicitly state that the money doesn’t exist, that the revenues are impossible, that one of the companies involved burns billions of dollars and has no path to profitability, is an act of irresponsible make believe and mythos. I am nobody. I am not a financier. I am not anybody special. I just write a lot, and read a lot, and can do the most basic maths in the world. I am not trying to be anything other than myself, nor do I have an agenda, other than the fact that I like doing this and I hate how this story is being told. I never planned for this newsletter to get this big, and now that it has, I’m going to keep doing the same thing every week. I also believe that the way to stop this happening again is to have a thorough and well-sourced explanation of everything as it happens, ripping down the narratives as they’re spun and making it clear who benefits from them and how and why they’re choosing to do so. When things collapse, we need to be clear about how many times people chose to look the other way, or to find good faith ways to interpret bad faith announcements and leak.

Full Content:
Soundtrack: Queens of the Stone Age - First It Giveth Before we go any further: This is, for the third time this year, the longest newsletter I've ever written, weighing in somewhere around 18,500 words. I've written it specifically to be read at your leisure — dip in and out where you'd like — but also in one go. This is my comprehensive case that yes, we’re in a bubble, one that will inevitably (and violently) collapse in the near future. I'll also be cutting this into a four-part episode starting tomorrow on my podcast Better Offline. I deeply appreciate your time. If you like this newsletter, please think about subscribing to the premium, which I write weekly. Thanks for reading. Alright, let’s do this one last time. In 2022, a (kind-of) company called OpenAI surprised the world with a website called ChatGPT that could generate text that sort-of sounded like a person using a technology called Large Language Models (LLMs), which can also be used to generate images, video and computer code. Large Language Models require entire clusters of servers connected with high-speed networking, all containing this thing called a GPU — graphics processing units. These are different to the GPUs in your Xbox, or laptop, or gaming PC. They cost much, much more, and they’re good at doing the processes of inference (the creation of the output of any LLM) and training (feeding masses of training data to models, or feeding them information about what a good output might look like, so they can later identify a thing or replicate it). These models showed some immediate promise in their ability to articulate concepts or generate video, visuals, audio, text and code. They also immediately had one glaring, obvious problem: because they’re probabilistic, these models can’t actually be relied upon to do the same thing every single time. So, if you generated a picture of a person that you wanted to, for example, use in a story book, every time you created a new page, using the same prompt to describe the protagonist, that person would look different — and that difference could be minor (something that a reader should shrug off), or it could make that character look like a completely different person. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of generative AI meant that whenever you asked it a question, it would guess as to the answer, not because it knew the answer, but rather because it was guessing on the right word to add in a sentence based on previous training data. As a result, these models would frequently make mistakes — something which we later referred to as “hallucinations.” And that’s not even mentioning the cost of training these models, the cost of running them, the vast amounts of computational power they required, the fact that the legality of using material scraped from books and the web without the owner’s permission was (and remains) legally dubious, or the fact that nobody seemed to know how to use these models to actually create profitable businesses. These problems were overshadowed by something flashy, and new, and something that investors — and the tech media — believed would eventually automate the single thing that’s proven most resistant to automation: namely, knowledge work and the creative economy. This newness and hype and these expectations sent the market into a frenzy, with every hyperscaler immediately creating the most aggressive market for one supplier I’ve ever seen. NVIDIA has sold over $200 billion of GPUs since the beginning of 2023, becoming the largest company on the stock market and trading at over $170 as of writing this sentence only a few years after being worth $19.52 a share. While I’ve talked about some of the propelling factors behind the AI wave — automation and novelty — that’s not a complete picture. A huge reason why everybody decided to “do AI” was because the software industry’s growth was slowing, with SaaS (Software As A Service) company valuations stalling or dropping, resulting in the terrifying prospect of companies having to “under promise and over deliver” and “be efficient.” Things that normal companies — those whose valuations aren’t contingent on ever-increasing, ever-constant growth — don’t have to worry about, because they’re normal companies. Suddenly, there was the promise of a new technology — Large Language Models — that were getting exponentially more powerful, which was mostly a lie but hard to disprove because “powerful” can mean basically anything, and the definition of “powerful” depended entirely on whoever you asked at any given time, and what that person’s motivations were. The media also immediately started tripping on its own feet, mistakenly claiming OpenAI’s GPT-4 model tricked a Taskrabbit into solving a CAPTCHA (it didn’t — this never happened), or saying that “people who don’t know how to code already [used] bots to produce full-fledged games,” and if you’re wondering what “full-fledged” means, it means “pong” and a cobbled-together rolling demo of SkyRoads, a game from 1993. The media (and investors) helped peddle the narrative that AI was always getting better, could do basically anything, and that any problems you saw today would be inevitably solved in a few short months, or years, or, well, at some point I guess. LLMs were touted as a digital panacea, and the companies building them offered traditional software companies the chance to plug these models into their software using an API, thus allowing them to ride the same generative AI wave that every other company was riding. The model companies similarly started going after individual and business customers, offering software and subscriptions that promised the world, though this mostly boiled down to chatbots that could generate stuff, and then doubled down with the promise of “agents” — a marketing term that’s meant to make you think “autonomous digital worker” but really means “broken digital product.” Throughout this era, investors and the media spoke with a sense of inevitability that they never really backed up with data. It was an era based on confidently-asserted “vibes.” Everything was always getting better and more powerful, even though there was never much proof that this was truly disruptive technology, other than in its ability to disrupt apps you were using with AI — making them worse by, for example, suggesting questions on every Facebook post that you could ask Meta AI, but which Meta AI couldn’t answer. “AI” was omnipresent, and it eventually grew to mean everything and nothing. OpenAI would see its every move lorded over like a gifted child, its CEO Sam Altman called the “Oppenheimer of Our Age,” even if it wasn’t really obvious why everyone was impressed. GPT-4 felt like something a bit different, but was it actually meaningful? The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is built and sold on not just faith, but a series of myths that the AI boosters expect us to believe with the same certainty that we treat things like gravity, or the boiling point of water. Can large language models actually replace coders? Not really, no, and I’ll get into why later in the piece. Can Sora — OpenAI’s video creation tool — replace actors or animators? No, not at all, but it still fills the air full of tension because you can immediately see who is pre-registered to replace everyone that works for them. AI is apparently replacing workers, but nobody appears to be able to prove it! But every few weeks a story runs where everybody tries to pretend that AI is replacing workers with some poorly-sourced and incomprehensible study, never actually saying “someone’s job got replaced by AI” because it isn’t happening at scale, and because if you provide real-world examples, people can actually check. To be clear, some people have lost jobs to AI, just not the white collar workers, software engineers, or really any of the career paths that the mainstream media and AI investors would have you believe. Brian Merchant has done excellent work covering how LLMs have devoured the work of translators, using cheap, “almost good” automation to lower already-stagnant wages in a field that was already hurting before the advent of generative AI, with some having to abandon the field, and others pushed into bankruptcy. I’ve heard the same for art directors, SEO experts, and copy editors, and Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal covered these last year. These are all fields with something in common: shitty bosses with little regard for their customers who have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to slash contract labor. To quote Merchant, “the drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of ‘powerful AI’ encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have.” Across the board, the people being “replaced” by AI are the victims of lazy, incompetent cost-cutters who don’t care if they ship poorly-translated text. To quote Merchant again, “[AI hype] has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting “good enough” automation output for video games and media products.” Yet the jobs crisis facing translators speaks to the larger flaws of the Large Language Model era, and why other careers aren’t seeing this kind of disruption. Generative AI creates outputs, and by extension defines all labor as some kind of output created from a request. In the case of translation, it’s possible for a company to get by with a shitty version, because many customers see translation as “what do these words say,” even though (as one worker told Merchant) translation is about conveying meaning. Nevertheless, “translation” work had already started to condense to a world where humans would at times clean up machine-generated text, and the same worker warned that the same might come for other industries. Yet the problem is that translation is a heavily output-driven industry, one where (idiot) bosses can say “oh yeah that’s fine” because they ran an output back through Google Translate and it seemed fine in their native tongue. The problems of a poor translation are obvious, but the customers of translation are, it seems, often capable of getting by with a shitty product. The problem is that most jobs are not output-driven at all, and what we’re buying from a human being is a person’s ability to think. Every CEO talking about AI replacing workers is an example of the real problem: that most companies are run by people who don’t understand or experience the problems they’re solving, don’t do any real work, don’t face any real problems, and thus can never be trusted to solve them. The Era of the Business Idiot is the result of letting management consultants and neoliberal “free market” sociopaths take over everything, leaving us with companies run by people who don’t know how the companies make money, just that they must always make more. When you’re a big, stupid asshole, every job that you see is condensed to its outputs, and not the stuff that leads up to the output, or the small nuances and conscious decisions that make an output good as opposed to simply acceptable, or even bad. What does a software engineer do? They write code! What does a writer do? They write words! What does a hairdresser do? They cut hair! Yet that’s not actually the case. As I’ll get into later, a software engineer does far more than just code, and when they write code they’re not just saying “what would solve this problem?” with a big smile on their face — they’re taking into account their years of experience, what code does, what code could do, all the things that might break as a result, and all of the things that you can’t really tell from just looking at code, like whether there’s a reason things are made in a particular way. A good coder doesn’t just hammer at the keyboard with the aim of doing a particular task. They factor in questions like: How does this functionality fit into the code that’s already here? Or, if someone has to update this code in the future, how do I make it easy for them to understand what I’ve written and to make changes without breaking a bunch of other stuff? A writer doesn’t just “write words.” They jostle ideas and ideals and emotions and thoughts and facts and feelings into a condensed piece of text, explaining both what’s happening and why it’s happening from their perspective, finding nuanced ways to convey large topics, none of which is the result of a single (or many) prompts but the ever-shifting sand of a writer’s brain. Good writing is a fight between a bunch of different factors: structure, style, intent, audience, and prioritizing the things that you (or your client) care about in the text. It’s often emotive — or at the very least, driven or inspired by a given emotion — which is something that an AI simply can’t replicate in a way that’s authentic and believable. And a hairdresser doesn’t just cut hair, but cuts your hair, which may be wiry, dry, oily, long, short, healthy, unhealthy, on a scalp with particular issues, at a time of year when perhaps you want to change length, at a time that fits you, in “the way you like” which may be impossible to actually write down but they get it just right. And they make conversation, making you feel at ease while they snip and clip away at your tresses, with you having to trust that they’ll get it right. This is the true nature of labor that executives fail to comprehend at scale: that the things we do are not units of work, but extrapolations of experience, emotion, and context that cannot be condensed in written meaning. Business Idiots see our labor as the result of a smart manager saying “do this,” rather than human ingenuity interpreting both a request and the shit the manager didn’t say. What does a CEO do? Uhhh, um, well, a Harvard study says they spend 25% of their time on “people and relationships,” 25% on “functional and business unit reviews,” 16% on “organization and culture,” and 21% on “strategy,” with a few percent here and there for things like “professional development.” That’s who runs the vast majority of companies: people that describe their work predominantly as “looking at stuff,” “talking to people” and “thinking about what we do next.” The most highly-paid jobs in the world are impossible to describe, their labor described in a mish-mash of LinkedInspiraton, yet everybody else’s labor is an output that can be automated. As a result, Large Language Models seem like magic. When you see everything as an outcome — an outcome you may or may not understand, and definitely don’t understand the process behind, let alone care about — you kind of already see your workers as LLMs. You create a stratification of the workforce that goes beyond the normal organizational chart, with senior executives — those closer to the class level of CEO — acting as those who have risen above the doldrums of doing things to the level of “decisionmaking,” a fuzzy term that can mean everything from “making nuanced decisions with input from multiple different subject-matter experts” to, as ServiceNow Bill McDermott did in 2022, “[make] it clear to everybody [in a boardroom of other executives], everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.” The same extends to some members of the business and tech media that have, for the most part, gotten by without having to think too hard about the actual things the companies are saying. I realize this sounds a little mean, and I must be clear it doesn’t mean that these people know nothing, just that it’s been possible to scoot through the world without thinking too hard about whether or not something is true. When Salesforce said back in 2024 that its “Einstein Trust Layer” and AI would be “transformational for jobs,” the media dutifully wrote it down and published it without a second thought. It fully trusted Marc Benioff when he said that Agentforce agents would replace human workers, and then again when he said that AI agents are doing “30% to 50% of all the work in Salesforce itself,” even though that’s an unproven and nakedly ridiculous statement. Salesforce’s CFO said earlier this year that AI wouldn’t boost sales growth in 2025. One would think this would change how they’re covered, or how seriously one takes Marc Benioff. It hasn’t, because nobody is paying attention. In fact, nobody seems to be doing their job. This is how the core myths of generative AI were built: by executives saying stuff and the media publishing it without thinking too hard. AI is replacing workers! AI is writing entire computer programs! AI is getting exponentially more-powerful! What does “powerful” mean? That the models are getting better on benchmarks that are rigged in their favor, but because nobody fucking explains it, regular people are regularly told that AI is “powerful.” The only thing “powerful” about generative AI is its mythology. The world’s executives, entirely disconnected from labor and actual production, are doing the only thing they know how to — spend a bunch of money and say vague stuff about “AI being the future.” There are people — journalists, investors, and analysts — that have built entire careers on filling in the gaps for the powerful as they splurge billions of dollars and repeat with increasing desperation that “the future is here” as absolutely nothing happens. You’ve likely seen a few ridiculous headlines recently. One of the most recent, and most absurd, is that that OpenAI will pay Oracle $300 billion over four years, closely followed with the claim that NVIDIA will “invest” “$100 billion” in OpenAI to build 10GW of AI data centers, though the deal is structured in a way that means that OpenAI is paid “progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” and OpenAI will be leasing the chips (rather than buying them outright). I must be clear that these deals are intentionally made to continue the myth of generative AI, to pump NVIDIA, and to make sure OpenAI insiders can sell $10.3 billion of shares. OpenAI cannot afford the $300 billion, NVIDIA hasn’t sent OpenAI a cent and won’t do so if it can’t build the data centers, which OpenAI most assuredly can’t afford to do. NVIDIA needs this myth to continue, because in truth, all of these data centers are being built for demand that doesn’t exist, or that — if it exists — doesn’t necessarily translate into business customers paying huge amounts for access to OpenAI’s generative AI services. NVIDIA, OpenAI, CoreWeave and other AI-related companies hope that by announcing theoretical billions of dollars (or hundreds of billions of dollars) of these strange, vague and impossible-seeming deals, they can keep pretending that demand is there, because why else would they build all of these data centers, right? That, and the entire stock market rests on NVIDIA’s back. It accounts for 7% to 8% of the value of the S&P 500, and Jensen Huang needs to keep selling GPUs. I intend to explain later on how all of this works, and how brittle it really is. The intention of these deals is simple: to make you think “this much money can’t be wrong.” It can. These people need you to believe this is inevitable, but they are being proven wrong, again and again, and today I’m going to continue doing so. Underpinning these stories about huge amounts of money and endless opportunity lies a dark secret — that none of this is working, and all of this money has been invested in a technology that doesn’t make much revenue and loves to burn millions or billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. Over half a trillion dollars has gone into an entire industry without a single profitable company developing models or products built on top of models. By my estimates, there is around $44 billion of revenue in generative AI this year (when you add in Anthropic and OpenAI’s revenues to the pot, along with the other stragglers) and most of that number has been gathered through reporting from outlets like The Information, because none of these companies share their revenues, all of them lose shit tons of money, and their actual revenues are really, really small. Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue — Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported “$13 billion in annualized revenue,” so around $1.083 billion a month. Microsoft is a sales MACHINE. It is built specifically to create or exploit software markets, suffocating competitors by using its scale to drive down prices, and to leverage the ecosystem that it’s created over the past few decades. $1 billion a month in revenue is chump change for an organization that makes over $27 billion a quarter in PROFITS. Don’t worry Satya, I’ll come back to you later. “But Ed, the early days!” Worry not — I’ve got that covered. This is nothing like any other era of tech. There has never been this kind of cash-rush, even in the fiber boom. Over a decade, Amazon spent about one-tenth of the capex that the Magnificent Seven spent in two years on generative AI building AWS — something that now powers a vast chunk of the web, and has long been Amazon’s most profitable business unit. Generative AI is nothing like Uber, with OpenAI and Anthropic’s true costs coming in at about $159 billion in the past two years, approaching five times Uber’s $30 billion all-time burn. And that’s before the bullshit with NVIDIA and Oracle. Microsoft last reported AI revenue in January. It’s October this week. Why did it stop reporting this number, you think? Is it because the numbers are so good it couldn’t possibly let people know? As a general rule, publicly traded companies — especially those where the leadership are compensated primarily in equity — tend to brag about their successes, in part because said bragging boosts the value of the thing that the leadership gets paid in. There’s no benefit to being shy. Oracle literally made a regulatory filing to boast it had a $30 billion customer, which turned out to be OpenAI, who eventually agreed (publicly) to spend $300 billion in compute over five years. Which is to say that Microsoft clearly doesn’t have any good news to share, and as I’ll reveal later, they can’t even get 3% of their 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot. If Microsoft can’t sell this shit, nobody can. Anyway, I’m nearly done, sorry, you see, I’m writing this whole thing as if you’re brand new and walking up to this relatively unprepared, so I need to introduce another company. In 2020, a splinter group jumped off of OpenAI, funded by Amazon and Google to do much the same thing as OpenAI but pretend to be nicer about it until they have to raise from the Middle East. Anthropic has always been better at coding for some reason, and people really like its Claude models. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have become the only two companies in generative AI to make any real progress, either in terms of recognition or in sheer commercial terms, accounting for the majority of the revenue in the AI industry. In a very real sense, the AI industry’s revenue is OpenAI and Anthropic. In the year where Microsoft recorded $13bn in AI revenues, $10 billion came from OpenAI’s spending on Microsoft Azure. Anthropic burned $5.3 billion last year — with the vast majority of that going towards compute. Outside of these two companies, there’s barely enough revenue to justify a single data center. Where we sit today is a time of immense tension. Mark Zuckerberg says we’re in a bubble, Sam Altman says we’re in a bubble, Alibaba Chairman and billionaire Joe Tsai says we’re in a bubble, Apollo says we’re in a bubble, nobody is making money and nobody knows why they’re actually doing this anymore, just that they must do it immediately. And they have yet to make the case that generative AI warranted any of these expenditures. That was undoubtedly the longest introduction to a newsletter I’ve ever written, and the reason why I took my time was because this post demands a level of foreshadowing and exposition, and because I want to make it make sense to anyone who reads it — whether they’ve read my newsletter for years, or whether they’re only just now investigating their suspicions that generative AI may not be all it’s cracked up to be. Today I will make the case that generative AI’s fundamental growth story is flawed, and explain why we’re in the midst of an egregious bubble. This industry is sold by keeping things vague, and knowing that most people don’t dig much deeper than a headline, a problem I simply do not have. This industry is effectively in service of two companies — OpenAI and NVIDIA — who pump headlines out through endless contracts between them and subsidiaries or investments to give the illusion of activity. OpenAI is now, at this point, on the hook for over a trillion dollars, an egregious sum for a company that already forecast billions in losses, with no clear explanation as to how it’ll afford any of this beyond “we need more money” and the vague hope that there’s another Softbank or Microsoft waiting in the wings to swoop in and save the day. I’m going to walk you through where I see this industry today, and why I see no future for it beyond a fiery apocalypse. While everybody (reasonably!) harps on about hallucinations — which, to remind you, is when a model authoritatively states something that isn’t true — but the truth is far more complex, and far worse than it seems. You cannot rely on a large language model to do what you want. Even the most highly-tuned models on the most expensive and intricate platform can’t actually be relied upon to do exactly what you want. A “hallucination” isn’t just when these models say something that isn’t true. It’s when they decide to do something wrong because it seems the most likely thing to do, or when a coding model decides to go on a wild goose chase, failing the user and burning a ton of money in the process. The advent of “reasoning” models — those engineered to ‘think’ through problems in a way reminiscent of a human — and the expansion of what people are (trying) to use LLMs for demands that the definition of an AI hallucination be widened, not merely referring to factual errors, but fundamental errors in understanding the user’s request or intent, or what constitutes a task, in part because these models cannot think and do not know anything. However successful a model might be in generating something good *once*, it will also often generate something bad, or it’ll generate the right thing but in an inefficient and over-verbose fashion. You do not know what you’re going to get each time, and hallucinations multiply with the complexity of the thing you’re asking for, or whether a task contains multiple steps (which is a fatal blow to the idea of “agents.” You can add as many levels of intrigue and “reasoning” as you want, but Large Language Models cannot be trusted to do something correctly, or even consistently, every time. Model companies have successfully convinced everybody that the issue is that users are prompting the models wrong, and that people need to be “trained to use AI,” but what they’re doing is training people to explain away the inconsistencies of Large Language Models, and to assume individual responsibility for what is an innate flaw in how large language models work. Large Language Models are also uniquely expensive. Many mistakenly try and claim this is like the dot com boom or Uber, but the basic unit economics of generative AI are insane. Providers must purchase tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs each costing $50,000 a piece, and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of infrastructure for large clusters. And that’s without mentioning things like staffing, construction, power, or water. Then you turn them on and start losing money. Despite hundreds of billions of GPUs sold, nobody seems to make any money, other than NVIDIA, the company that makes them, and resellers like Dell and Supermicro who buy the GPUs, put them in servers, and sell them to other people. This arrangement works out great for Jensen Huang, and terribly for everybody else. I am going to explain the insanity of the situation we find ourselves in, and why I continue to do this work undeterred. The bubble has entered its most pornographic, aggressive and destructive stage, where the more obvious it becomes that they’re cooked, the more ridiculous the generative AI industry will act — a dark juxtaposition against every new study that says “generative AI does not work” or new story about ChatGPT’s uncanny ability to activate mental illness in people. So, let’s start simple: NVIDIA is a hardware company that sells GPUs, including the consumer GPUs that you’d see in a modern gaming PC, but when you read someone say “GPU” within the context of AI, they mean enterprise-focused GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and more modern GPUs like the Blackwell-series B200 and GB200 (which combines two GPUs with an NVIDIA CPU). These GPUs cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 (or as high as $70,000 for the newer Blackwell GPUs), and require tens of thousands of dollars more of infrastructure — networking to “cluster” server racks of GPUs together to provide compute, and massive cooling systems to deal with the massive amounts of heat they produce, as well as the servers themselves that they run on, which typically use top-of-the-line data center CPUs, and contain vast quantities of high-speed memory and storage. While the GPU itself is likely the most expensive single item within an AI server, the other costs — and I’m not even factoring in the actual physical building that the server lives in, or the water or electricity that it uses — add up. I’ve mentioned NVIDIA because it has a virtual monopoly in this space. Generative AI effectively requires NVIDIA GPUs, in part because it’s the only company really making the kinds of high-powered cards that generative AI demands, and because NVIDIA created something called CUDA — a collection of software tools that lets programmers write software that runs on GPUs, which were traditionally used primarily for rendering graphics in games. While there are open-source alternatives, as well as alternatives from Intel (with its ARC GPUs) and AMD (Nvidia’s main rival in the consumer space), these aren’t nearly as mature or feature-rich. Due to the complexities of AI models, one cannot just stand up a few of these things either — you need clusters of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of them for it to be worthwhile, making any investment in GPUs in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, especially considering they require completely different data center architecture to make them run. A common request — like asking a generative AI model to parse through thousands of lines of code and make a change or an addition — may use multiple of these $50,000 GPUs at the same time, and so if you aspire to serve thousands, or millions of concurrent users, you need to spend big. Really big. It’s these factors — the vendor lock-in, the ecosystem, and the fact that generative AI only works when you’re buying GPUs at scale — that underpin the rise of Nvidia. But beyond the economic and technical factors, there are human ones, too. To understand the AI bubble is to understand why CEOs do the things they do. Because an executive’s job is so vague, they can telegraph the value of their “labor” by spending money on initiatives and making partnerships. AI gave hyperscalers the excuse to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and buy a bunch of GPUs to go in them, because that, to the markets, looks like they’re doing something. By virtue of spending a lot of money in a frighteningly short amount of time, Satya Nadella received multiple glossy profiles, all without having to prove that AI can really do anything, be it a job or make Microsoft money. Nevertheless, AI allowed CEOs to look busy, and once the markets and journalists had agreed on the consensus opinion that “AI would be big,” all that these executives had to do was buy GPUs and “do AI.” We are in the midst of one of the darkest forms of software in history, described by many as an unwanted guest invading their products, their social media feeds, their bosses’ empty minds, and resting in the hands of monsters. Every story of its success feels bereft of any real triumph, with every literal description of its abilities involving multiple caveats about the mistakes it makes or the incredible costs of running it. Generative AI exists for two reasons: to cost money, and to make executives look busy. It was meant to be the new enterprise software and the new iPhone and the new Netflix all at once, a panacea where software guys pay one hardware guy for GPUs to unlock the incredible value creation of the future. Generative AI was always set up to fail, because it was meant to be everything, was talked about like it was everything, is still sold like it’s everything, yet for all the fucking hype, it all comes down to two companies: OpenAI, and, of course, NVIDIA. NVIDIA was, for a while, living high on the hog. All CEO Jensen Huang had to do every three months was saying “check out these numbers” and the markets and business journalists would squeal with glee, even as he said stuff like “the more you buy the more you save,” in part tipping his head to the (very real and sensible) idea of accelerated computing, but framed within the context of the cash inferno that’s generative AI, seems ludicrous. Huang’s showmanship worked really well for NVIDIA for a while, because for a while the growth was easy. Everybody was buying GPUs. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (and to a lesser extent Apple and Tesla) make up 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue, creating, at least for the first four, a degree of shared mania where everybody justified buying tens of billions of dollars of GPUs a year by saying “the other guy is doing it!” This is one of the major reasons the AI bubble is happening, because people conflated NVIDIA’s incredible sales with “interest in AI,” rather than everybody buying GPUs. Don’t worry, I’ll explain the revenue side a little bit later. We’re here for the long haul. Anyway, NVIDIA is facing a problem — that the only thing that grows forever is cancer. On September 9 2025, the Wall Street Journal said that NVIDIA’s “wow” factor was fading, going from beating analyst estimates in by nearly 21% in its Fiscal Year Q2 2024 earnings to scraping by with a mere 1.52% beat in its most-recent earnings — something that for any other company, would be a good thing, but framed against the delusional expectations that generative AI has inspired, is a figure that looks nothing short of ominous. Per the Wall Street Journal: In any other scenario, 56% year-over-year growth would lead to an abundance of Dom Perignon and Huang signing hundreds of boobs, but this is NVIDIA, and that’s just not good enough. Back in February 2024, NVIDIA was booking 265% year-over-year growth, but in its February 2025 earnings, NVIDIA only grew by a measly 78% year-over-year. It isn’t so much that NVIDIA isn’t growing, but that to grow year-over-year at the rates that people expect is insane. Life was a lot easier when NVIDIA went from $6.05 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2023 to $22 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2024, but for it to grow even 55% year-over-year from Q2 FY2026 ($46.7 billion) to Q2 2027 would require it to make $72.385 billion in revenue in the space of three months, mostly from selling GPUs (which make up around 88% of its revenue). This would put Nvidia in the ballpark of Microsoft ($76 billion in the last quarter) and within the neighborhood of Apple ($94 billion in the last quarter), predominantly making money in an industry that a year-and-a-half ago barely made the company $6 billion in a quarter. And the market needs NVIDIA to perform, as the company makes up 8% of the value of the S&P 500. It’s not enough for it to be wildly profitable, or have a monopsony on selling GPUs, or for it to have effectively 10x’d their stock in a few years. It must continue to grow at the fastest rate of anything ever, making more and more money selling these GPUs to a small group of companies that immediately start losing money once they plug them in. While a few members of the Magnificent Seven could be depended on to funnel tens of billions of dollars into a furnace each quarter, there were limits, even for companies like Microsoft, which had bought over 485,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. To take a step back, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make their money by either selling access to Large Language Models that people incorporate into their products, or by renting out servers full of GPUs to run inference (as said previously, the process to generate an output by a model or series of models) or train AI models for companies that develop and market models themselves, namely Anthropic and OpenAI. The latter revenue stream of which is where Jensen Huang found a solution to that eternal growth problem: the neocloud, namely CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius. These businesses are fairly straightforward. They own (or lease) data centers that they then fill full of servers that are full of NVIDIA GPUs, which they then rent on an hourly basis to customers, either on a per-GPU basis or in large batches for larger customers, who guarantee they'll use a certain amount of compute and sign up to long-term (i.e. more than an hour at a time) commitments. A neocloud is a specialist cloud compute company that exists only to provide access to GPUs for AI, unlike Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which have healthy businesses selling other kinds of compute, with AI (as I’ll get into later) failing to provide much of a return on investment. It’s not just the fact that these companies are more specialized than, say, Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft Azure. As you’ve gathered from the name, these are new, young, and in almost all cases, incredibly precarious businesses — each with financial circumstances that would make a Greek finance minister blush. That’s because setting up a neocloud is expensive. Even if the company in question already has data centers — as CoreWeave did with its cryptocurrency mining operation — AI requires completely new data center infrastructure to house and cool the GPUs, and those GPUs also need paying for, and then there’s the other stuff I mentioned earlier, like power, water, and the other bits of the computer (the CPU, the motherboard, the memory and storage, and the housing). As a result, these neoclouds are forced to raise billions of dollars in debt, which they collateralize using the GPUs they already have, along with contracts from customers, which they use to buy more GPUs. CoreWeave, for example, has $25 billion in debt on estimated revenues of $5.35 billion, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. You know who also invests in these neoclouds? NVIDIA! NVIDIA is also one of CoreWeave’s largest customers (accounting for 15% of its revenue in 2024), and just signed a deal to buy $6.3 billion of any capacity that CoreWeave can’t otherwise sell to someone else through 2032, an extension of a $1.3 billion 2023 deal reported by the Information. It was the anchor investor ($250 million) in CoreWeave’s IPO, too. NVIDIA is currently doing the same thing with Lambda, another neocloud that NVIDIA invested in, which also plans to go public next year. NVIDIA is also one of Lambda’s largest customers, signing a deal with it this summer to rent 10,000 GPUs for $1.3 billion over four years. In the UK, NVIDIA has just invested $700 million in Nscale, a former crypto miner that has never built an AI data center, and that has, despite having no experience, committed $1 billion (and/or 100,000 GPUs) to an OpenAI data center in Norway. On Thursday, September 25, Nscale announced it had closed another funding round, with NVIDIA listed as a main backer — although it’s unclear how much money it put in. It would be safe to assume it’s another few hundred million. NVIDIA also invested in Nebius, an outgrowth of Russian conglomerate Yandex, and Nebius provides, through a partnership with NVIDIA, tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of compute credits to companies in NVIDIA’s Inception startup program. NVIDIA’s plan is simple: fund these neoclouds, let these neoclouds load themselves up with debt, at which point they buy GPUs from NVIDIA, which can then be used as collateral for loans, along with contracts from customers, allowing the neoclouds to buy even more GPUs. It’s like that Robinhood infinite money glitch… …except, that is, for one small problem. There don’t appear to be that many customers. As I went into recently on my premium newsletter, NVIDIA funds and sustains Neoclouds as a way of funnelling revenue to itself, as well as partners like Supermicro and Dell, resellers that take NVIDIA GPUs and put them in servers to sell pre-built to customers. These two companies made up 39% of NVIDIA’s revenues last quarter. Yet when you remove hyperscaler revenue — Microsoft, Amazon, Google, OpenAI and NVIDIA — from the revenues of these neoclouds, there’s barely $1 billion in revenue combined, across CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda. CoreWeave’s $5.35 billion revenue is predominantly made up of its contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft (offering compute for OpenAI), Google (hiring CoreWeave to offer compute for OpenAI), and OpenAI itself, which has promised CoreWeave $22.4 billion in business over the next few years. This is all a lot of stuff, so I’ll make it really simple: there is no real money in offering AI compute, but that isn’t Jensen Huang’s problem, so he will simply force NVIDIA to hand money to these companies so that they have contracts to point to when they raise debt to buy more NVIDIA GPUs. Neoclouds are effectively giant private equity vehicles that exist to raise money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, or for hyperscalers to move money around so that they don’t increase their capital expenditures and can, as Microsoft did earlier in the year, simply walk away from deals they don’t like. Nebius’ “$17.4 billion deal” with Microsoft even included a clause in its 6-K filing that Microsoft can terminate the deal in the event the capacity isn’t built by the delivery dates, and Nebius has already used the contract to raise $3 billion to… build the data center to provide compute for the contract. Here, let me break down the numbers: From my analysis, it appears that CoreWeave, despite expectations to make that $5.35 billion this year, has only around $500 million of non-Magnificent Seven or OpenAI AI revenue in 2025, with Lambda estimated to have around $100 million in AI revenue, and Nebius around $250 million without Microsoft’s share, and that’s being generous. In simpler terms, the Magnificent Seven is the AI bubble, and the AI bubble exists to buy more GPUs, because (as I’ll show) there’s no real money or growth coming out of this, other than in the amount that private credit is investing — “$50 billion a quarter, for the low end, for the past three quarters.” I dunno man, let’s start simple: $50 billion a quarter of data center funding is going into an industry that has less revenue than Genshin Impact. That feels pretty bad. Who’s gonna use these data centers? How are they going to even make money on them? Private equity firms don’t typically hold onto assets, they sell them or take them public. Doesn’t seem great to me! Anyway, if AI was truly the next big growth vehicle, neoclouds would be swimming in diverse global revenue streams. Instead, they’re heavily-centralized around the same few names, one of which (NVIDIA) directly benefits from their existence not as a company doing business, but as an entity that can accrue debt and spend money on GPUs. These Neoclouds are entirely dependent on a continual flow of private credit from firms like Goldman Sachs (Nebius, CoreWeave, Lambda for its IPO), JPMorgan (Lambda, Crusoe, CoreWeave), and Blackstone (Lambda, CoreWeave), who have in a very real sense created an entire debt-based infrastructure to feed billions of dollars directly to NVIDIA, all in the name of an AI revolution that's yet to arrive. The fact that the rest of the neocloud revenue stream is effectively either a hyperscaler or OpenAI is also concerning. Hyperscalers are, at this point, the majority of data center capital expenditures, and have yet to prove any kind of success from building out this capacity, outside, of course, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which has succeeded in generating revenue while burning billions of dollars. Hyperscaler revenue is also capricious, but even if it isn’t, why are there no other major customers? Why, across all of these companies, does there not seem to be one major customer who isn’t OpenAI? The answer is obvious: nobody that wants it can afford it, and those who can afford it don’t need it. It’s also unclear what exactly hyperscalers are doing with this compute, because it sure isn’t “making money.” While Microsoft makes $10 billion in revenue from renting compute to OpenAI via Microsoft Azure, it does so at-cost, and was charging OpenAI $1.30-per-hour for each A100GPU it rents, a loss of $2.2 an hour per GPU, meaning that it is likely losing money on this compute, especially as SemiAnalysis has the total cost per hour per GPU at around $1.46 with the cost of capital and debt associated for a hyperscaler, though it’s unclear if that’s for an H100 or A100 GPU. In any case, how do these neoclouds pay for their debt if the hyperscalers give up, or NVIDIA doesn’t send them money, or, more likely, private credit begins to notice that there’s no real revenue growth outside of circular compute deals with neoclouds’ largest supplier, investor and customer? They don’t! In fact, I have serious concerns that they can’t even build the capacity necessary to fulfil these deals, but nobody seems to worry about that. No, really! It appears to be taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of compute capacity. How exactly are any of these neoclouds (or Oracle itself) able to expand to actually capture this revenue? Who knows! But I assume somebody is going to say “OpenAI!” Here’s an insane statistic for you: OpenAI will account for — in both its own revenue (projected $13 billion) and in its own compute costs ($16 billion, according to The Information, although that figure is likely out of date, and seemingly only includes the compute it’ll use, and not that it has committed to build, and thus has spent money on) — about 50% of all AI revenues in 2025. That figure takes into account the $400m ARR for ServiceNow, Adobe, and Salesforce; the $35bn in revenue for the Magnificent Seven from AI (not profit, and based on figures from the previous year); revenue from neoclouds like CoreWeave, Nebius, and Lambda; and the estimated revenue from the entire generative AI industry (including Anthropic and other smaller players, like Perplexity and Anysphere) for a total of $55bn.OpenAI is the generative AI industry — and it’s a dog of a company. As a reminder, OpenAI has leaked that it’ll burn $115 billion in the next four years, and based on my estimates, it needs to raise more than $290 billion in the next four years based on its $300 billion deal with Oracle alone. That alone is a very, very bad sign, especially as we’re three years and $500 billion or more into this hype cycle with few signs of life outside of, well, OpenAI promising people money. Credit to Anthony Restaino for this horrifying graphic: This is not what a healthy, stable industry looks like. Alright, well, things can’t be that bad on the software side. Right? Right? As I covered on my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, everybody is losing money on generative AI, in part because the cost of running AI models is increasing, and in part because the software itself doesn’t do enough to warrant the costs associated with running them, which are already subsidized and unprofitable for the model providers. Outside of OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Anthropic), nobody seems to be making much revenue, with the most “successful” company being Anysphere, makers of AI coding tool Cursor, which hit $500 million ‘annualized” (so $41.6 million in one month) a few months ago, just before Anthropic and OpenAI jacked up the prices for “priority processing” on enterprise queries, raising its operating costs as a result. In any case, that’s some piss-poor revenue for an industry that’s meant to be the future of software. Smartwatches are projected to make $32 billion this year, and as mentioned, the Magnificent Seven expects to make $35 billion or so in revenue from AI this year. Even Anthropic and OpenAI seem a little lethargic, both burning billions of dollars while making, by my estimates, no more than $2 billion and $6.26 billion in 2025 so far, despite projections of $5 billion and $13 billion respectively. Outside of these two, AI startups are floundering, struggling to stay alive and raising money in several-hundred million dollar bursts as their negative-gross-margin businesses flounder. As I dug into a few months ago, I could find only 12 AI-powered companies making more than $8.3 million a month, with two of them slightly improving their revenues, specifically AI search company Perplexity (which has now hit $150 million ARR, or $12.5 million in a month) and AI coding startup Replit (which also hit $150 million ARR in September). Both of these companies burn ridiculous amounts of money. Perplexity burned 164% of its revenue on Amazon Web Services, OpenAI and Anthropic last year, and while Replit hasn’t leaked its costs, The Information reports its gross margins in July were 23%, which doesn’t include the costs of its free users, which you simply have to do with LLMs as free users are capable of costing you a hell of a lot of money. Problematically, your paid users can also cost you more than they bring in as well. In fact, every user loses you money in generative AI, because it’s impossible to do cost control in a consistent manner. A few months ago, I did a piece about Anthropic losing money on every single Claude Code subscriber, and I’ll walk you through it in a very simplified fashion: Anthropic is, to be clear, the second-largest model developer, and has some of the best AI talent in the industry. It has a better handle on its infrastructure than anyone outside of big tech and OpenAI. It still cannot seem to fix this problem, even with weekly rate limits. While one could assume that Anthropic is simply letting people run wild, my theory is far simpler: even the model developers have no real way of limiting user activity, likely due to the architecture of generative AI. I know it sounds insane, but at the most advanced level, model providers are still prompting their models, and whatever rate limits may be in place appear to, at times, get completely ignored, and there doesn’t seem to be anything they can do to stop it. No, really. Anthropic counts amongst its capitalist apex predators one lone Chinese man who spent $50,000 of their compute in the space of a month fucking around with Claude Code. Even if Anthropic was profitable — it isn’t, and will burn billions this year — a customer paying $200-a-month running up $50,000 in costs immediately devours the margin of any user running the service that day, if not that week or month. Even if Anthropic’s costs are half the published rates, one guy amounted to 125 users’ monthly revenue. That’s not a real business! That’s a bad business with out-of-control costs, and it doesn’t appear anybody has these costs under control. A few weeks ago, Replit — an unprofitable AI coding company — released a product called “Agent 3.” which promised to be “10x more autonomous” and offer “infinitely more possibilities,” “[testing] and [fixing] its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop.” In reality, this means you’d go and tell the model to build something and it would “go do it,” and you’ll be shocked to hear that these models can’t be relied upon to “go and do” anything. Please note that this was launched a few months after Replit raised its prices, shifting to obfuscated “effort-based” pricing that would charge “the full scope of the agent’s work.” Agent 3 has been a disaster. Users found tasks that previously cost a few dollars were spiralling into the hundreds of dollars, with The Register reporting one customer found themselves with a $1000 bill after a week: Another user complained that “costs skyrocketed, without any concrete results”: As I previously reported, in late May/early June, both OpenAI and Anthropic cranked up the pricing on their enterprise customers, leading to Replit and Cursor both shifting their prices. This abuse has now trickled down to their customers. Replit has now released an update that lets you choose how autonomous you want Agent 3 to be, which is a tacit admission that you can’t trust coding LLMs to build software. Replit’s users are still pissed off, complaining that Replit is charging them for activity when the agent doesn’t do anything, a consistent problem across its Reddit. While Reddit is not the full summation of all users across every company, it’s a fairly good barometer of user sentiment, and man, are users pissy. Traditionally, Silicon Valley startups have relied upon the same model of “grow really fast and burn a bunch of money, then “turn the profit lever.” AI does not have a “profit lever,” because the raw costs of providing access to AI models are so high (and they’re only increasing) that the basic economics of how the tech industry sells software don’t make sense. I’ll reiterate something I wrote a few weeks ago: In simpler terms, it is very, very difficult to imagine what one user — free or otherwise — might cost, and thus it’s hard to charge them on a monthly basis, or tell them what a service might cost them on average. This is a huge problem with AI coding environments. According to The Information, Claude Code was driving “nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from a few weeks ago” on July 31 2025. That annualized revenue works out to about $33 million a month in revenue for a company that predicts it will make at least $416 million a month by the end of the year, and for a product that has become the most-popular coding environment in the world, from the second-largest and best-funded AI company in the world. …is that it? Is that all that’s happening here? $33 million dollars, all of it unprofitable, after it felt, at least based on social media chatter and discussing with multiple different software engineers, that Claude Code had become ubiquitous with anything to do with LLMs. To be clear, Anthropic’s Sonnet and Opus models are consistently some of the most popular for programming on Openrouter, an aggregator of LLM usage, and Anthropic has been consistently-named as “the best at coding.” Some bright spark out there is going to say that Microsoft’s Github Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and guess what, that’s true, and in fact, I reported it! Here’s another fun fact: the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft loses “on average more than $20-a-month-per-user,” with “...some users [costing] the company as much as $80.” And that’s for the most-popular product! If you believe the New York Times or other outlets that simply copy and paste whatever Dario Amodei says, you’d think that the reason that software engineers are having trouble finding work is because their jobs are being replaced by AI. This grotesque, abusive, manipulative and offensive lie has been propagated throughout the entire business and tech media without anybody sitting down and asking whether it’s true, or even getting a good understanding of what it is that LLMs can actually do with code. Members of the media, I am begging you, stop doing this. I get it, every asshole is willing to give a quote saying that “coding is dead,” and that every executive is willing to burp out some nonsense about replacing all of their engineers, but I am fucking begging you to either use these things yourself, or speak to people that do. I am not a coder. I cannot write or read code. Nevertheless, I am capable of learning, and have spoken to numerous software engineers in the last few months, and basically reached a consensus of “this is kind of useful, sometimes.” However, one very silly man once said that I don’t speak to people who use these tools, so I went and spoke to three notable, experienced software engineers, and asked them to give me the straight truth about what coding LLMs can do. In simple terms, LLMs are capable of writing code, but can’t do software engineering, because software engineering is the process of understanding, maintaining and executing code to produce functional software, and LLMs do not “learn,” cannot “adapt,” and (to paraphrase Brown), break down the more of your code and variables you ask them to look at at once. It’s very easy to believe that software engineering is just writing code, but the reality is that software engineers maintain software, which includes writing and analyzing code among a vast array of different personalities and programs and problems. Good software engineering harkens back to Brian Merchant’s interviews with translators — while some may believe that translators simply tell you what words mean, true translation is communicating the meaning of a sentence, which is cultural, contextual, regional, and personal, and often requires the exercise of creativity and novel thinking. My editor, Matthew Hughes, gave an example of this in his newsletter: Similarly, coding is not just “a series of text that programs a computer,” but a series of interconnected characters that refers to other software in other places that must also function now and explain, on some level, to someone who has never, ever seen the code before, why it was done this way. This is, by the way, why we are still yet to get any tangible proof that AI is replacing software engineers…because it can’t. Of all the fields supposedly at risk from “AI disruption,” coding feels (or felt) the most tangible, if only because the answer to “can you write code with LLMs” wasn’t an immediate, unilateral no. The media has also been quick to say that AI “writes software,” which is true in the same way that ChatGPT “writes novels”. In reality, LLMs can generate code, and do some software engineering-adjacent tasks, but, like all Large Language Models, break down and go totally insane, hallucinating more as the tasks get more complex. And, as I pointed out earlier, software engineering is not just coding. It involves thinking about problems, finding solutions to novel challenges, designing stuff in a way that can be read and maintained by others, and that’s (ideally) scalable and secure. The whole fucking point of an “AI” is that you hand shit off to it! That’s what they’ve been selling it as! That’s why Jensen Huang told kids to stop learning to code, as with AI, there’s no point. And it was all a lie. Generative AI can’t do the job of a software engineer, and it fails while also costing abominable amounts of money. Coding LLMs seem like magic at first, because they (to quote a conversation with Carl Brown) make the easy things easier, but they also make the harder things harder. They don’t even speed up engineers — they actually make them slower! Yet coding is basically the only obvious use case for LLMs. I’m sure you’re gonna say “but I bet the enterprise is doing well!” and you are so very, very wrong. Before I go any further, let’s establish some facts: All of this is to say that Microsoft has one of the largest commercial software empires in history, thousands (if not tens of thousands) of salespeople, and thousands of companies that literally sell Microsoft services for a living. And it can’t sell AI. A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers. This would amount to, if each of these users paid annually at the full rate of $30-a-month, to about $2.88 billion in annual revenue for a product category that makes $33 billion a fucking quarter. And I must be clear, I am 100% sure these users aren’t all paying $30 a month. The Information reported a few weeks ago that Microsoft has been “reducing the software’s price with more generous discounts on the AI features, according to customers and salespeople,” heavily suggesting discounts had already been happening. Enterprise software is traditionally sold at a discount anyway — or, put a different way, with bulk pricing for those who sign up a bunch of users at once. In fact, I’ve found evidence that it’s been doing this a while, with a 15% discount on annual Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions for orders of 10-to-300 seats mentioned by an IT consultant back in late 2024, and another that’s currently running through September 30, 2025 through Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider program, with up to 2400 licenses discounted if you pay upfront for the year. Microsoft seems to do this a lot, as I found another example of an offer that ran from January 1 2025 through March 31 2025. An “active” user is someone who has taken one action on Copilot in any Microsoft 365 app in the space of 28 days. Now, I know. That word, active. Maybe you’re thinking “Ed, this is like the gym model! There are unpaid licenses that Microsoft is getting paid for!” Fine! Let’s assume that Microsoft also has, based on research that suggests this is the case for all software companies, another 50% — four million — of paid Copilot licenses that aren’t being used. That still makes this 12 million users, which is still a putrid 2.72% conversion rate. So, why aren’t people paying for Copilot? Let’s hear from someone who talked to The Information: Microsoft 365 Copilot has been such a disaster that Microsoft will now integrate Anthropic’s models in an attempt and make them better. Oh, one other thing: sources also confirm GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%. I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August. So, The Information reported a few months ago that Microsoft’s projected AI revenues would be $13 billion, with $10 billion of that from OpenAI, leaving about $3 billion of total revenue across Microsoft 365 Copilot and any other foreseeable feature that Microsoft sells with “AI” on it. This heavily suggests that Microsoft is making somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on Azure or Microsoft 365 Copilot, though I suppose there are other places it could be making AI revenue too. Right? I guess. In any case, Microsoft’s net income (read: profit) in its last quarterly earnings was $27.2 billion. Pathetic. One of the comfortable lies that people tell themselves is that the AI bubble is similar to the fiber boom, or the dot com bubble, or Uber, or that we’re in the “growth stage,” or that “this is what software companies do, they spend a bunch of money then “pull the profit lever.” This is nothing like anything you’ve seen before, because this is the dumbest shit that the tech industry has ever done. AI data centers are nothing like fiber, because there are very few actual use cases for these GPUs outside of AI, and none of them are remotely hyperscale revenue drivers. As I discussed a month or so ago, data center development accounted for more of America’s GDP growth than all consumer spending combined, and there really isn’t any demand for AI in general, let alone at the scale that these hundreds of billions of dollars are being sunk into. The conservative estimate of capital expenditures related to data centers is around $400 billion, but given the $50 billion a quarter in private credit, I’m going to guess it breaks $500 billion, all to build capacity for an industry yet to prove itself. And this NVIDIA-OpenAI “$100 billion funding” news should only fill you full of dread, but also it isn’t fucking finalized, stop reporting it as if it’s done, I swear to god- Anyway, according to CNBC, “the initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized,” with “successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company’s then-current valuation as new capacity comes online.” At no point is anyone asking how, exactly, OpenAI builds data centers to fill full of these GPUs. In fact, I am genuinely shocked (and a little disgusted!) by how poorly this story has been told. Let’s go point by point: To be clear, when I say OpenAI needs at least $300 billion over the next four years, that’s if you believe its projections, which you shouldn’t. Let’s walk through its (alleged) numbers, while plagiarizing myself: According to The Information, here's the breakdown (these are projections): OpenAI's current reported burn is $116 billion through 2030, which means there is no way that these projections include $300 billion in compute costs, even when you factor in revenue. There is simply no space in these projections to absorb that $300 billion, and from what I can tell, by 2029, OpenAI will have actually burned more than $290 billion, assuming that it survives that long, which I do not believe it will. Don’t worry, though. OpenAI is about to make some crazy money. Here are the projections that CFO Sarah Friar signed off on: Just so we are clear, OpenAI intends to 10x its revenue in the space of four years, selling software and access to models in an industry with about $60 billion of revenue in 2025. How will it do this? It doesn’t say. I don’t know OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, but I do know that signing off on these numbers is, at the very least, ethically questionable. Putting aside the ridiculousness of OpenAI’s deals, or its funding requirements, Friar has willfully allowed Sam Altman and OpenAI to state goals that defy reality or good sense, all to take advantage of investors and public markets that have completely lost the plot. I need to be blunter: OpenAI has signed multiple different deals and contracts for amounts it cannot afford to pay, that it cannot hope to raise the money to pay for, that defy the amounts of venture capital and private credit available, all to sustain a company that will burn $300 billion and has no path to profitability of any kind. So, as I said above, CNBC reported on September 23, 2025 that the NVIDIA deal will be delivered in $10 billion tranches, the first of which is “expected to close within a month,” and the rest delivered “as new capacity comes online.” This is, apparently, all part of a plan to build 10GW of data center capacity with NVIDIA. A few key points: So, let’s start simple: data centers take forever to build. As I said previously, based on current reports, it’s taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of data center capacity, and nowhere in these reports does one reporter take a second to say “hey, what data centers are you talking about?” or “hey, didn’t Sam Altman say back in July that he was building 10GW of data center capacity with Oracle?” But wait, now Oracle and OpenAI have done another announcement that says they’re only doing 7GW, but they’re “ahead of schedule” on 10GW? Wait, is NVIDIA’s 10GW the same 10GW as Oracle and OpenAI are working on? Is it different? Nobody seems to know or care! Anyway, I cannot be clear enough how unlikely it is that (as NVIDIA has said) “the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026,” and that’s if it has bought the land and got the permits and ordered the construction, none of which has happened yet. But let’s get really specific on costs! Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI is a $15 billion joint venture, which means a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion. Abilene’s eight buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs. Though this math is a little funky due to NVIDIA promising to install its new Rubin GPUs in these theoretical data centers, that means these data centers will require a little under $200 billion worth of GPUs. By my maths that’s $325 billion. I’m so tired of this. A number of you have sent me the following image with some sort of comment about how “this is how it’ll work,” and you are wrong, because this is neither how it works nor how it will work nor accurate on any level. In the current relationship, NVIDIA Is Not Sending OpenAI $100 Billion, nor will it send it that much money, because 90% of OpenAI’s funding is gated behind building 9 or 10 gigawatts of data center capacity. In the current relationship, OpenAI does not have the money to pay Oracle. Also, can Oracle even afford to give that much money to NVIDIA? It had negative free cash flow last quarter, already has $104 billion in debt, and its biggest new customer cannot afford a single fucking thing it’s promised. The only company in this diagram that actually can afford to do any of this shit is NVIDIA, and even then it only has $56 billion cash on hand. In any case, as I went over on Friday, OpenAI has promised about a trillion dollars between compute contracts across Oracle, Microsoft, Google and CoreWeave, 17 Gigawatts of promised data centers in America between NVIDIA and “Stargate,” several more gigawatts of international data centers, custom chips from Broadcom, and their own company operations. How exactly does this get paid for? Nobody seems to ask these questions! Why am I the asshole doing this? Don’t we have tech analysts that are meant to analyse shit? AHhhhh- Every time I sit down to write about this subject the newsletters seem to get longer, because people are so painfully attached to the norms and tropes of the past. This post is, already, 17,500 words — a record for this newsletter — and I’ve still not finished editing and expanding it. What we’re witnessing is one of the most egregious wastes of capital in history, sold by career charlatans with their reputations laundered by a tech and business media afraid to criticize the powerful and analysts that don’t seem to want to tell their investors the truth. There are no historic comparisons here — even Britain’s abominable 1800s railway bubble, which absorbed half of the country’s national income, created valuable infrastructure for trains, a vehicle that can move people to and from places. GPUs are not trains, nor are they cars, or even CPUs. They are not adaptable to many other kinds of work, nor are they “the infrastructure of the future of tech,” because they’re already quite old and with everybody focused on buying them, you’d absolutely see one other use case by now that actually mattered. GPUs are expensive, power-hungry, environmentally destructive and require their own kinds of cooling and server infrastructure, making every GPU data center and environmental and fiscal bubble unto themselves. And, whereas the Victorian train infrastructure still exists in the UK — though it has been upgraded over the years — a GPU has a limited useful lifespan. These are cards that can — and will — break after a period of extended usage, whether that period is five years or later, and they’ll inevitably be superseded by something better and more powerful, meaning that the resale value of that GPU will only go down, with a price depreciation that’s akin to a new car. I am telling you, as I have been telling you for years, again and again and again, that the demand is not there for generative AI, and the demand is never, ever arriving. The only reason anyone humours any of this crap is the endless hoarding of GPUs to build capacity for a revolution that will never arrive. Well, that and OpenAI, a company built and sold on lies about ChatGPT’s capabilities. ChatGPT’s popularity — and OpenAI’s hunger for endless amounts of compute — have created the illusion of demand due to the sheer amount of capacity required to keep their services operational, all so they can burn $8 billion or more in 2025 and, if my estimates are right, nearly a trillion dollars by 2030. This NVIDIA deal is a farce — an obvious attempt by the largest company on the American stock market to prop up the one significant revenue-generator in the entire industry, knowing that time is running out for it to create new avenues for eternal growth. I’d argue that NVIDIA’s deal also shows the complete contempt that these companies have for the media. There are no details about how this deal works beyond the initial $10 billion, there’s no land purchased, no data center construction started, and yet the media slurps it down without a second thought. I am but one man, and I am fucking peculiar. I did not learn financial analysis in school, but I appear to be one of the few people doing even the most basic analysis of these deals, and while I’m having a great time doing so, I am also exceedingly frustrated at how little effort is being put into prying apart these deals. I realize how ridiculous all of this sounds. I get it. There’s so much money being promised to so many people, market rallies built off the back of massive deals, and I get that the assumption is that this much money can’t be wrong, that this many people wouldn’t just say stuff without intending to follow through, or without considering whether their company could afford it. I know it’s hard to conceive that hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested in something for no apparent reason, but it’s happening, right god damn now, in front of your eyes, and I am going to be merciless on anyone who attempts to write a “how could we see this coming?” Generative AI has never been reliable, has always been unprofitable, and has always been unsustainable, and I’ve been saying so since February 2024. The economics have never made sense, something I’ve said repeatedly since April 2024, and when I wrote “How Does OpenAI Survive?” in July 2024, I had multiple people suggest I was being alarmist. Here’s some alarmism for you: the longer it takes for OpenAI to die, the more damage it will cause to the tech industry. On Friday, when I put out my piece on OpenAI needing a trillion dollars, I asked analyst Gil Luria if the capital was there to build the 17 Gigawatts that OpenAI had allegedly planned to build. He said the following: That doesn’t sound good! Anyway, as I discussed earlier, venture capital could run out in six quarters, with investor and researcher Jon Sakoda estimating that there will only be around $164 billion of dry powder (available capital) in US VC firms by the end of 2025. In July, The French Tech Journal reported (using Pitchbook data) that global venture capital deal activity reached its lowest first-half total since 2018, with $139.4 billion in deal value in the first half of 2025, down from $183.4 billion in the first half of 2024, meaning that any further expansion or demands for venture capital from OpenAI will likely sap the dwindling funds available from other startups. Things get worse when you narrow things to US venture capital. In a piece from April, EY reported that VC-backed investment in US companies hit $80 billion in Q1 2025, but “one $40 billion deal” accounted for half of the investment — OpenAI’s $40 billion deal of which only $10 billion has actually closed, and that didn’t happen until fucking June. Without the imaginary money from OpenAI, US venture would have declined by 36%. The longer that OpenAI survives, the longer it will sap the remaining billions from the tech ecosystem, and I expect it to extend its tendrils to private credit too. The $325 billion it needs just to fulfil its NVIDIA contract, albeit over 4 years, is an egregious sum that I believe exceeds the available private capital in the world. Let’s get specific, and check out the top 10 private equity firms’ available capital! Assuming that all of this capital is currently available, the top 10 private equity firms in the world have around $477 billion of available capital. We can, of course, include investment banks — Goldman Sachs had around $520 billion cash in hand available at the end of its last quarter, and JPMorgan over $1.7 trillion, but JP Morgan has only dedicated $50 billion in direct lending commitments as of February 2025, and while Goldman Sachs expanded its direct private credit lending by $15 billion back in June, that appears to be an extension of its “more than $20 billion” direct lending close from mid-2024. Include both of those, and that brings us up to — if we assume that all of these funds are available — $562 billion in capital and about $164 billion in US venture available to spend, and that’s meant to go to more places than just OpenAI. Sure, sure, there’s more than just the top 10 private equity firms and there’s venture money outside of the US, but what could it be? Like, another $150 billion? You see, OpenAI needs to buy those GPUs, and it needs to build those data centers, and it needs to pay its thousands of staff and marketing and sales costs too. While OpenAI likely wouldn’t be the ones raising the money for the data centers — and honestly, I’m not sure who would do it at this point? — somebody is going to need to build TWENTY GIGAWATTS OF DATA CENTERS if we’re to believe both Oracle and NVIDIA You may argue that venture funds and private credit can raise more, and you’re right! But at this point, there have been few meaningful acquisitions of AI companies, and zero exits from the billions of dollars put into data centers. Even OpenAI admits in its own announcement about new Stargate sites that this will be a “$400 billion investment over 3 years.” Where the fuck is that money coming from? Is OpenAI really going to absorb massive chunks of all available private credit and venture capital for the next few years? And no, god, stop saying the US government will bail this out. It will have to bail out hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no scenario where it’s anything less than that, and I’ve already been over this. While the US government has spent equivalent sums in the past to support private business (the total $440 billion dispersed during the Great Recession’s TARP program, where the Treasury bought toxic assets from investment banks to stop them from imploding a la Lehman, springs to mind), it’s hard to imagine any case where OpenAI is seen as vital to the global financial system — and the economic health of the US — as the banking system. Sure, we spent around $1tn — if we’re being specific, $953bn — on the Paycheck Protection Program during the Covid era, but that was to keep people employed at a time when the economy outside of Zoom and Walmart had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist. There was an urgency that doesn’t apply here. If OpenAI goes tits up, Softbank loses some money — nothing new there — and Satya Nadella has to explain why he spent tens of billions of dollars on a bunch of data centers filled with $50,000 GPUs that are, at this point, ornamental. And while there will be — and have been — disastrous economic consequences, they won’t be as systemically catastrophic as that of the pandemic, or the global financial crisis. To be clear, it’ll be bad, but not as bad. And there’s also the problem of moral hazard — if the government steps in, what’s to stop big tech chasing its next fruitless rainbow? — and optics. If people resented bailing out the banks after they acted like profligate gamblers and lost, how will they feel bailing out fucking Sam Altman and Jensen Huang? I do apologize for the length of this piece, but the significance of this bubble requires depth. There is little demand, little real money, and little reason to continue, and the sheer lack of responsibility and willingness to kneel before the powerful fills me full of angry bile. I understand many journalists are not in a position where they can just write “this shit sounds stupid,” but we have entered a deeply stupid era, and by continuing to perpetuate the myth of AI, the media guarantees that retail investors and regular people’s 401Ks will suffer. It is now inevitable that this bubble bursts. Deutsche Bank has said the AI boom is unsustainable outside of tech spending “remaining parabolic,” which it says “is highly unlikely,” and Bain Capital has said that $2 trillion in new revenue is needed to fund AI’s scaling, and even that math is completely fucked as it talks about “AI-related savings”: Even when stared in the face by a ridiculous idea — $2 trillion of new revenue in a global software market that’s expected to be around $817 billion in 2025 — Bain still oinks out some nonsense about the “savings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support and R&D,” yet another myth perpetuated I assume to placate the fucking morons sinking billions into this. Every single “vibe coding is the future,” “the power of AI,” and “AI job loss” story written perpetuates a myth that will only lead to more regular people getting hurt when the bubble bursts. Every article written about OpenAI or NVIDIA or Oracle that doesn’t explicitly state that the money doesn’t exist, that the revenues are impossible, that one of the companies involved burns billions of dollars and has no path to profitability, is an act of irresponsible make believe and mythos. I am nobody. I am not a financier. I am not anybody special. I just write a lot, and read a lot, and can do the most basic maths in the world. I am not trying to be anything other than myself, nor do I have an agenda, other than the fact that I like doing this and I hate how this story is being told. I never planned for this newsletter to get this big, and now that it has, I’m going to keep doing the same thing every week. I also believe that the way to stop this happening again is to have a thorough and well-sourced explanation of everything as it happens, ripping down the narratives as they’re spun and making it clear who benefits from them and how and why they’re choosing to do so. When things collapse, we need to be clear about how many times people chose to look the other way, or to find good faith ways to interpret bad faith announcements and leak.

Title: Trump’s visa fee hike is not the only worry. Hostility mounts for Indian IT in US

Even as US President Donald Trump’s steep hike in H-1B visa fee threatens to hit Indian software services providers, US lawmakers and agencies have separately intensified the scrutiny of the offshoring sector. Homegrown Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the country’s largest information technology (IT) services company, and India-heritage Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. were among the companies targeted by two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley and Democrat Richard J. Durbin, over hiring practices. A third senator, Tom Cotton, is considering bills to reform of H-1B programme, while his Republican peer Bernie Moreno has proposed an HIRE Act to increase taxes on companies offshoring work. Growing scrutiny makes the $283-billion local outsourcing industry even more vulnerable after Trump signed an executive order to increase the one-time fee for H-1B Visas from the current $1,000 to $100,000 starting next year. The target is the alleged misuse of H-1B visas, which enable highly skilled non-immigrants to work in the US temporarily. These permits are issued for three years with an option to renew for up to six years. Indian IT companies accounted for 70% of such visas issued in 2024. "The question is, how impactful are the letters by Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin? In my opinion, very. There could be potential Senate investigations into the issue of H-1B visas, and leaders of all the companies could be called to give sworn testimonies before the Senate," said Russell A. Stamets, a partner at Circle of Counsels, a New Delhi-based law firm. "Indian companies desperately need knowledgeable American voices to help them navigate this, not simply people who have lived in the US for some time. Cultural nuance is critical in these discussions," said Stamets. Last Wednesday, judiciary committee chairman Grassley and Durbin wrote to TCS CEO K Krithivasan and his Cognizant counterpart S Ravi Kumar over their hiring practices. “TCS recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 people worldwide, including American staff. For example, TCS laid off nearly five dozen employees in its Jacksonville office alone last month," read the 24 September letter to Krithivasan. TCS sponsored 5,505 H-1B employees in FY25, the second-largest beneficiary, behind Amazon.com Inc. The senators accused the company of firing Americans and substituting them with H-1B employees. “TCS is already under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American workers in favor of newly hired South-Asian H-1B employees. TCS is doing itself no favors by replacing Americans with H-1Bs while this investigation is ongoing," said the letter. Accused of discriminationThey accused Cognizant of discriminating against white Americans. “Last year, a federal jury concluded that Cognizant intentionally engaged in race-based discrimination by favoring South-Asian H-1B workers over American employees. The jury also found that Cognizant’s conduct warranted punitive damages. Cognizant is doing itself no favors by continuing to replace Americans with H-1B workers on the heels of this verdict," read the 24 September letter to Kumar. Last fiscal, Cognizant received approvals to hire 2,493 H-1B employees, making it the seventh-largest user of these visas. TCS, which follows an April-March financial calendar, ended FY25 with $30.18 billion in revenue, while Cognizant, which follows a January-December financial calendar, generated $19.74 billion in revenue. Also Read | Did Trump just slam the door on Indian doctors and nurses? The senators asked nine questions to both Krithivasan and Kumar, including the reasons behind hiring H-1B employees while laying off their American staff, and whether TCS and Cognizant deliberately hid their H-1B recruitment ads by listing them separately from general hiring ads. The senators also sought answers on whether both companies paid the same salaries and allowed similar benefits to H-1B workers and their American counterparts. TCS and Cognizant have until 10 October to respond to the letter from US lawmakers. Queries emailed to TCS, Cognizant, and senators Grassley and Durbin went unanswered. To be sure, both Grassley and Durbin have been working to introduce more stringent laws that address the H-1B visa issue since 2007. Both also wrote to the remaining eight large beneficiaries of H-1B visas, including Amazon, Apple Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. H-1B reform agendaCotton, meanwhile, said he might introduce two bills that suggest changes to the H-1B program. “President Trump and @SecretaryLCD (Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer) are absolutely right that the H-1B program needs reforms," said Cotton in a 26 September social media post on X. “Next week I’m introducing two bills that will bring badly needed changes to this program and put American workers first." Earlier this month, Moreno, a senator from Ohio, proposed the HIRE legislation, which aims to make outsourcing costlier and reduce reliance on cheap foreign labour. Indian IT firms earn nearly three-fifths of their revenue from the US as large American companies outsource their back-end tech work to homegrown IT services companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro. Offshoring a targetHowever, the HIRE Act may not become law, and even if it did, its impact would be higher on American firms than on homegrown IT service providers, as the tech service providers are expected to pass on the costs to their clients, Mint reported on 10 September, citing conversations with sector experts and analysts. Still, the changing regulatory landscape, coupled with AI, could be a double whammy for Indian tech firms. Also Read | What tariffs and H-1B visa fee hike can teach investors "I believe the rise of AI is a bigger risk to the Indian IT outsourcing firms. So, all these policies and regulatory changes regarding free people movement, along with the rise of AI, are like a double-whammy for outsourcing firms," said Stamets. “Only the most innovative tech outsourcing firms will be able to work around and capitalise on the opportunity." Investors are anxious as the country's 10 largest IT services companies have shed nearly 8% in their combined market cap last week.

To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! The autonomous vehicle industry is years — maybe decades — from maturing. And so there’s still a Wild West quality to the sector, in spite of the steady stream of announcements that do show marked progress. Two such news items from this week illustrate my point of progress, possibility, and even a bit of peril (at least to the ups and downs a public market can provide). First up is Gatik, an AV and logistics startup that is applying its tech to middle-mile trucks. The startup, which I first wrote about in 2019, announced a multi-year and expanded commercial partnership with Canada’s largest retailer, Loblaw. Under the deal, Gatik will deploy 20 autonomous trucks by the end of 2025 to provide driverless delivery to Loblaw’s network of stores in the greater Toronto area. Co-founder and CEO Gautam Narang told me the company will add another 30 autonomous trucks to the fleet by the end of 2026. The deal is notable, and not just because of the fleet size. As Narang explained to me, the trucks will be handling the full regional network for Loblaw. This means these third-generation AV trucks will operate autonomously to pick up products from two distribution centers and make deliveries to over 300 retail stores. “These are multiple brands within the Loblaw umbrella,” he said. In other words, this is not some fixed-route pilot program. It’s commercial, and it’s complex. Next up is Kodiak Robotics, another startup I have reported on since its founding. The company, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, began trading on Nasdaq this week under the tickers KDK and KDKRW. The company, which is now called Kodiak AI, went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II, an affiliate of Ares Management. The deal valued the startup at about $2.5 billion. Kodiak raised $275 million in financing. More than $212.5 million came from certain institutional investors, including $145 million in PIPE funding and about $62.9 million in trust cash from Ares. It should be noted that the trust cash is smaller (it was $562 million), as some SPAC investors redeemed their shares. I spoke to founder and CEO Don Burnette the day before Kodiak’s big debut about why he took the company public — let alone via a SPAC. It was a big moment for Burnette, whose family was on hand to watch him ring the bell and mark the milestone. The stock was trading at about $7.70 Friday, down about 10% from its market open. “As you can imagine, building and scaling a transformative autonomous driving company is very capital intensive, and we were looking to access the public markets as a path forward for the company. And when choosing between, you know, traditional IPO or a SPAC, we considered all the options,” he said. “We felt like, from a timing perspective, it was the right decision for the company (to take the SPAC route).” It should be noted that Burnette is also quite bullish on defense. Here’s why: “I think autonomy is the future of ground transportation broadly,” he said, before noting the benefits within defense for logistics and reconnaissance operations for ground vehicles. “One of the key things is defense requires unstructured autonomy, and this is one of the areas where we become specialists.” A few weeks ago, we wrote about some trouble at Hyundai‘s electric air taxi startup Supernal, including that the company had stopped work on its air taxi program and that its CEO and CTO were out. This week, a little bird told us that a wider reorg of Supernal’s C-suite was afoot — something Hyundai Motor Group has now confirmed to us. Chief strategy officer Jaeyong Song and chief safety officer Tracy Lamb are part of a “transition to new leadership,” according to the Korean conglomerate. Song’s departure is particularly notable, as he was once the VP of Hyundai’s Advanced Air Mobility division, which Supernal was spun out of in 2021. Also gone is Lina Yang, who most recently served as chief of staff to the startup’s now-former CEO, but who also served as Supernal’s “Head of Intelligent Systems” before that. Got a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com. Remember Moxion Power, the portable battery startup that raised $110 million before going bankrupt? The founders are back with a new startup called Anode Technology Company, which has designed a mobile battery and inverter that can be used for EV charging and supplying remote power to construction sites and live events. The startup just raised $9 million in seed funding in a round led by Eclipse Ventures; its partner, Jiten Behl, who spearheaded the deal, was previously Rivian’s chief growth officer. Apparently, Behl’s interest was sparked by his experience at Rivian. Side note: Palo Alto-based venture capital firm Eclipse sure has been busy this year. The VC firm led the $105 million round of Also, the micromobility startup that spun out of Rivian, and recently hired longtime T. Rowe Price Group investor Joe Fath as partner and head of growth. The firm doesn’t explicitly focus on transportation, but some of its portfolio companies in this sector include Arc, Bedrock Robotics, Reliable Robotics, Skyryse, and Wayve. Other deals that got my attention … Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India that competes with Uber, doubled its valuation to $2.3 billion following a secondary share sale by food delivery giant Swiggy. The share sale comes just weeks after Rapido began piloting food deliveries, edging into Swiggy’s core territory. Telo, the tiny electric truck developer, raised $20 million in a Series A funding round co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo’s board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and early-stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo. TheTrump administration is seeking up to a 10% stake in Lithium Americas in exchange for renegotiating the repayment period of a $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan. GM is a major investor in the Canadian company, which is developing a lithium mine in Nevada that is expected to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Hackers have had quite an active week in the transportation sector. Stellantis confirmed a data breach involving customers’ personal information. The breach is linked to a hack of its Salesforce database. Meanwhile, a hack that began last Friday and targeted check-in systems provided by Collins Aerospace caused delays at Brussels, Berlin, and Dublin airports, as well as London’s Heathrow. The U.K.’s National Crime Agency has arrested a man in connection to the ransomware attack. And finally, Jaguar Land Rover said it will not resume production at its factories for yet another week as it continues to grapple with fallout from a cyberattack. Battery materials startup Sila started operations at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, a milestone that could pave the way for longer-range, faster-charging EVs. The factory is the first large-scale silicon anode factory in the West and will initially be capable of making enough battery materials for 20,000 to 50,000 EVs. Future expansion could fulfill demand for as many as 2.5 million vehicles. Automakers continue to pull back on EVs and electrified vehicles. Honda is ending U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle that was being built by General Motors in Tennessee, CNBC reported. And Stellantis has canceled plans to produce a 4xe plug-in hybrid Jeep Gladiator in North America by the end of 2025. Which EV is next on the chopping block? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Rivian over issues with the seat belts in its electric delivery vans that could introduce additional risk in the event of a crash, Bloomberg reported. Tesla asked the Environmental Protection Agency not to roll back current vehicle emissions standards, breaking from other major automakers that want to see the rules eased. TuneIn, an audio streaming service, is collaborating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deliver emergency alerts directly to drivers. Volvo Cars is pledging a commitment to U.S. production. The company said it will continue to invest in its U.S. car plant near Charleston, South Carolina, and announced plans to expand the factory to produce a hybrid vehicle by the end of the decade. Waymo launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. Zoox has asked federal regulators for an exemption that would allow the Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle company to commercially deploy its custom-built robotaxis, which lack traditional controls like pedals and a steering wheel. Finally, proof of life from Luminar founder Austin Russell. You may remember that Russell was mysteriously and suddenly replaced in May as CEO of the lidar company he created. The company has never truly explained his departure, only that it was the result of a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” initiated by the board. Russell has been silent; while he remains on Luminar’s board, he hasn’t signed any of the filings the company has submitted with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since he was replaced. This week, he reappeared as the co-founder of a new company called Russell AI Labs. It’s billed as a “platform that backs and builds transformative AI and frontier technology companies.” It doesn’t seem like his troubles at Luminar have affected his ability to attract high-profile support or make eyebrow-raising deals. Russell’s co-founders are Markus Schäfer, CTO and board member at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Murtaza Ahmed, who served as a managing director at Goldman Sachs before joining SoftBank and was a partner in the $100 billion Vision Fund and managing partner of its $5 billion Latin America Fund. As part of Russell AI Lab’s debut, the startup announced it has taken a $300 million stake in agentic AI company Emergence AI.

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself? The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “ Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history. The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds. The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies. But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy. Perhaps the most instructive parallel for today’s AI boom lies in the massive infrastructure overinvestment that preceded the dot-com crash. Telecommunications companies laid more than 80 million miles of fiber optic cables across the U.S., driven by WorldCom’s wildly inflated claim that internet traffic was doubling every 100 days—far beyond the actual annual doubling rate. Companies like Global Crossing, Level 3, and Qwest raced to build massive networks to capture anticipated demand that never materialized. The result was catastrophic overcapacity. Even four years after the bubble burst, 85% to 95% of the fiber laid in the 1990s remained unused, earning the nickname “dark fiber.” Corning, the world’s largest optical-fiber producer, saw its stock crash from nearly $100 in 2000 to about $1 by 2002. Ciena’s revenue fell from $1.6 billion to $300 million almost overnight, with its stock plunging 98% from its peak. The parallels to today’s AI infrastructure buildout are unmistakable. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans this year for an AI data center “so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan”. The Stargate Project, backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, aims to develop a $500 billion nationwide network of AI data centers. Yet, crucial differences exist. Unlike many dot-com companies that had no revenue, major AI players are generating substantial income. Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, heavily focused on AI, grew 39% year-over-year to an $86 billion run rate. OpenAI projects $20 billion in annualized revenue by the end of the year, according to The Information, up from around $6 billion at the start of the year. The dot-com crash ultimately came down to a harsh reality: Most internet companies couldn’t justify their valuations with actual business results. Companies were valued based on website traffic and growth metrics rather than traditional measures like cash flow and profitability. Today’s AI companies face a similar test. While AI investment has reached historic levels, the revenue gap remains substantial. According to tech writer Ed Zitron, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google will have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years, but have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue combined. A recent MIT study found that 95% of AI pilot projects fail to yield meaningful results, despite more than $40 billion in generative AI investment. This disconnect between investment and returns echoes the fundamental problem that ultimately doomed the dot-com bubble. The question facing investors today isn’t whether AI will transform the economy—most experts agree it will. The question is whether current valuations and infrastructure investments can be justified by near-term returns, or whether, like the fiber-optic cables of the 1990s, much of today’s AI infrastructure will sit unused while the market awaits demand to catch up with supply. As history shows, even transformative technologies can’t escape the gravitational pull of economics—so while the internet did change the world, it didn’t happen as quickly as some of its early champions promised, and several of those people who got ahead of themselves were humbled in the process.

Title: Amazon’s fall hardware event: 5 Echo devices overdue for an upgrade

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. After skipping last year, Amazon is back with a big fall hardware event slated for next week, and we’re expecting plenty of new Echo smart speakers and displays that make the most of Alexa+, Amazon’s AI revamp of the Alexa voice assistant. Plenty of other hardware will also be unwrapped during Amazon’s September 30 event in New York City; for example, we’re sure to see new Kindle tablets, as well as Fire TV models and perhaps even some Ring cameras. For now, though, we’re concentrating on new Echo devices, and there are a few popular Echo speakers and displays that are ripe for an upgrade. We’re most interested in how the latest Echo hardware will take full advantage of Alexa+, the generative AI-enhanced Alexa that can carry on flowing conversations, take actions on your behalf, and control smart home devices based on natural-language commands. (It’s worth noting that most existing Echo speakers and displays already are compatible with Alexa+, so there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you don’t want to.) Don’t miss our hands-on impressions of the all-new Echo and Echo Show lineup. There haven’t been many leaks or rumors about specific new Echo devices we might see next week. That said, we do have a bead on some older but nonetheless popular Echo speakers and displays that are in dire need of a refresh. What is it: Amazon’s flagship Echo speaker that doubles as a smart home hub Latest release: 2020 (fourth generation) List price: $99.99 Michael Brown/Foundry It’s been nearly five years since Amazon released a new version of its top-of-the-line Echo, making it the oldest speaker in Amazon’s current Echo lineup. It’s high time for a new one. A larger version of the popular and inexpensive Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo shares many of the Dot’s features, including motion detection, a temperature sensor, and the ability to extend the range of Amazon’s line of Eero mesh Wi-Fi routers. The Echo also houses stereo tweeters and a three-inch woofer, making for a nice upgrade to the Echo Dot’s so-so audio performance. But the Echo has an ace up its sleeve: a full-on Zigbee home hub, capable of directly controlling Zigbee lights, sensors, switches, and other Zigbee-enabled devices. The Echo also packs a Thread radio, allowing it to act as a Thread border router. Plunk an Echo in your living room, and you have everything you need to launch your smart home—well, aside from a Z-Wave radio, which would be a cool feature for an updated Echo. (We’re not holding on breath on that one, as Z-Wave is not embraced by the Matter standard.) An all-new Echo would seem like a no-brainer for Amazon’s hardware event next week, complete with beefier hardware for smoother Alexa+ performance and perhaps even a physical makeover. What it is: Amazon’s budget-priced Echo workhorse Latest release: 2022 (fifth generation) List price: $49.99 Ben Patterson/Foundry If the Echo is Amazon’s flagship smart speaker, the Echo Dot is its smaller sibling, shedding the Zigbee smart hub but keeping the motion and temperature sensors as well as the Eero mesh extender functionality. Priced at $50 but often on sale for much less, the Echo Dot is a smart choice for putting Alexa in every room, what with its handsome design and good-enough audio performance. There are now cheaper Echos in Amazon’s lineup—see the $40 Echo Pop from 2023—but the Echo Dot hits the sweet spot in terms of price and performance. Now that it’s due to celebrate its third birthday, the Echo Dot is primed for a new Alexa+-enhanced version. I could see it sharing the same overall design as the new Echo—smaller form factor, of course—with a modest audio upgrade and even a Thread border router functionality, which would allow the Dot to act as a hub for Matter devices. What it is: A premium Echo speaker that does Dolby Atmos Latest release: 2023 (second generation) List price: $199.99 (no longer available) Amazon If you want an Amazon Echo speaker that can truly put on a sonic show, the Dolby Atmos-enabled Echo Studio is the obvious choice—if you can find one, that is. The second-generation Echo Studio has been out of stock for months now, making it a prime candidate for a makeover. Packing three two-inch mid-range speakers, a 20mm tweeter, and a 5.25-inch woofer, the Echo Studio has all the drivers its needs to belt out audiophile-quality sound. The Echo Studio isn’t just a great music speaker, though. Like the Echo, it offers a Zigbee home hub and a Matter hub. An upgraded version of the Studio with Alexa+ playing DJ could be a highlight of Amazon’s hardware event next week. What it is: An Echo display with a pivoting screen that follows you around the room Latest release: 2021 (third generation) List price: $249.99 (no longer available) Michael Brown/Foundry Hard to believe, but it’s been four years since the Echo Show 10 made its debut, and boy was it a showstopper. Yes, the Echo Show 10 boasts such smart home features as a Zigbee hub and a Thread border router (the unit’s Matter-over-Thread abilities were enabled after launch), 2.1-channel audio, a 13-megapixel camera, and an impressive 10-inch screen. But its killer feature was its swiveling display, which could follow you as you strolled around the room. That rotating display made the Echo Show 10 feel like the most aware Echo device yet, so just imagine how that would play with Alexa+ on board, looking out into your kitchen and making suggestions as you prepare a gourmet meal. Sure, Alexa+ can already work on the existing third-gen Echo Show 10, but we’re eager to see a new take on that motorized design. As with the Echo Studio, the Echo Show 10 has been unavailable via Amazon for some time, leading us to believe that a fourth generation of the display is imminent. What is it: Amazon’s Alexa-powered smart glasses Latest release: 2023 (third generation) List price: Varies depending upon style Ben Patterson/Foundry With the likes of Meta’s camera-enabled AI glasses on the scene, Amazon’s audio-only Echo Frames are looking decidedly old hat these days. First announced back in 2019, the Echo Frames came with a handsome design and mini speakers and microphones in the temples that promised to put Alexa in your head. The most recent release from 2023 offered updated looks and plenty of audio refinements, and the Frames are now compatible with Alexa+. Still, the basic conceit and limitations remain: it’s Alexa (or Alexa+) in your head, and only in your head. Meta, meanwhile, has supercharged the market for smart glasses that allow an AI companion to see the world around you, offering commentary and insights wherever you go (even if the results are a tad uneven). Will Amazon take the fight to Meta with vision-enabled Echo Frames with Alexa+? It’s a bit of a long shot, but I’m not ruling it out.

Title: Is the Big Business of AI Dominated by Too Few Big Businesses?

U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies. Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with "Customer A" representing 23% of sales and "Customer B" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales. But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies. Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers. “Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.” The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth. Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years. Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said. Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration. Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI. The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT. “These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.” Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications. Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post / Getty Images Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises. “It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back.

Also, BI's new markets newsletter is coming to inboxes soon. Sign up for First Trade here! On the agenda today: But first: Where do you store all of those groceries? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. I've got a confession: I don't get what all the fuss is about Costco. Gigantic bags of potato chips, enough ketchup to last until the end of the decade, endless rolls of toilet paper (well, maybe post-COVID I get that one). But seriously, why does anyone need a 20-pound tub of margarine? A colleague (who may or may not be the lead weekday writer of this newsletter) wants to buy a second refrigerator for his garage just so he can store even more stuff from Costco. "The biggest pain point in my marriage is probably Costco," BI's Dan DeFrancesco told me. "Before every trip, my wife warns me not to get carried away. And then I proceed to get carried away and buy 18 pounds of chicken breasts." Look, I get it. Buying in bulk is very much en vogue these days. Just look at Costco's earnings report the other day. Sales and profit are up. Total paid memberships are rising. More people are finding the experience so compelling that they're upgrading their memberships. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said opening early for executive members boosted weekly sales by 1%. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai indicates the adjusted hours are helping the company accomplish several key goals, namely getting shoppers to visit more quickly and more often. Costco is also set to open new locations faster than usual, particularly in areas with popular stores. The goal is to relieve some of the traffic pressure in those locations, creating a better shopping experience. People talk about Costco the way some talk about religion. It's an experience, a pilgrimage if you will, for hot deals and free samples. You can get everything from ever-pricey gold bars to the ultimate inflation-proof offering: the vaunted $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. Maybe I'm just a city snob who doesn't get all the finer things in life that Costco has to offer. I'll stick with Trader Joe's and my corner bodega. What are your thoughts on Costco and the early hours for executive members? We'd love to hear from you. Please email me at srussolillo@insider.com. Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal. Taylor Swift and Kanye West. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Having a workplace enemy isn't always the most pleasant experience, but battling them can actually push you to grow and further your career. That's because a work nemesis is often a competitor for a boss' praise or promotion. Competition can be a driver of peak performance — as long as it stays healthy. Who's your office opp? Startup founders and their employees were thrown into a frenzy after President Donald Trump announced his new $100,000 H-1B visa fee. Some young companies have frozen hiring as they wait for more clarity. While the Big Tech companies are by far the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program, the proposed changes will have an outsized impact on smaller startups, according to 10 founders and investors BI spoke with. "Is there another shoe about to drop?" Also read: The company recently announced another round of corporate layoffs and an array of store closures across North America. It's part of CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" initiative, and takes a page out of his Chipotle turnaround strategy. At Chipotle, Niccol revitalized the chain's brand after a 2015 E. coli scandal. The coffee giant is a much bigger beast, though — and his efforts haven't paid off yet. A huge undertaking.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement This is your complete guide to all the Alexa voice commands that make managing your smart home easier than ever. These voice commands can help you unlock Alexa's true potential. If you still think Alexa is just for setting timers and playing music, it's time to catch up. After 11 years, Amazon finally gave its voice assistant a massive brain upgrade with the new, AI-powered Alexa Plus, and it's a total game-changer. This isn't the same Alexa you're used to. The new version is smarter, more conversational, and can actually anticipate your needs. We're talking about an assistant that can manage your entire smart home, juggle your calendar, and follow you from room to room. While privacy is still a valid concern for many, a recent CNET survey found Alexa is the most trusted AI assistant out there. Your Echo device is now capable of so much more, but it's useless if you don't know what to say. Here are the essential Alexa commands you need to know to unlock what your smart speaker can actually do now. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We're learning what America looks like with fewer immigrants and fewer jobs. The Trump administration has been cracking down on immigration over the past few months, ramping up deportations and travel bans. It recently announced a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa program applicants, which could affect some major companies, like Amazon, that leverage the program. Immigration policies could be exacerbating the defining feature of the frozen 2025 labor market: Workers haven't faced mass layoffs, but hiring has slowed to a crawl. A more slowly-growing labor force with lower levels of immigration will likely see a much lower level of job growth, but weak labor demand with weak supply means that unemployment may not spike. And even native-born workers have not yet seen a major boon to employment in that continuing slow market. Dante DeAntonio, labor economist at Moody's Analytics, said there's "no doubt" immigration policy changes are affecting the job market. "There was a clear downshift in labor force growth starting in the second half of 2024, and the labor force has flatlined so far in 2025," DeAntonio said. "The most immediate impact of this change is a likely shortage of available labor, particularly in industries that are more heavily reliant on foreign-born labor, such as agriculture, construction, and leisure/hospitality." Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said President Donald Trump aims to grow the US economy and add job opportunities for Americans. "There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws," Jackson said. "The Trump Administration is focused on protecting the American workforce, ending instances of labor exploitation or trafficking, and working with American employers to ensure they have the legal workforce they need to be successful." Below are some of the ways immigration has affected the job market. Declining immigration means a more slowly growing workforce, which could make this summer's disappointingly low job growth a new normal. One measure used to assess the labor market's performance is the breakeven rate, or how much job growth is needed to keep unemployment steady as the labor force adds more new entrants from immigration and young people aging into their working years. A more slowly-growing workforce from lower levels of immigration would make that breakeven rate drop, and that could lead to lower job growth in the long run. We won't know the full extent of how the likely decline in immigration has affected population growth for a while, so estimates for how many jobs the US needs to add each month to keep unemployment stable in the long run could vary widely. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider that if net immigration is zero, it would mean a breakeven rate close to August's job growth. However, he cautioned that we don't yet know the full extent of the immigration slowdown. A blog post from Kolko showed that the breakeven rate in early 2024 was much higher. Other estimates for that breakeven rate are higher. A Morgan Stanley note in early September said that 70,000 jobs added a month by the end of the year is probably consistent with flat unemployment. That would mean recent growth is too low. On the other end of the spectrum, David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider the payroll growth needed to keep unemployment constant could be around zero. "You've got very weak growth at this stage in the economy because we've got really no increase in the number of people available to work," Kelly said. Immigration changes don't necessarily mean a better job market for non-immigrant job seekers. The native-born unemployment rate has ticked up from January's rate. "Some people expected that a slowdown in immigration would open up jobs for native-born workers," Kolko said. People are having a hard time getting a job because companies aren't so eager to hire or lay people off as they deal with economic uncertainty. "Sending immigrant workers away is not going to insulate workers from the labor market impact of tariffs or a recession," said Chris Martin, the lead researcher at company-review and job-search platform Glassdoor. Pay is one reason DeAntonio thinks immigration changes would take a while to see a positive effect on non-immigrant job seekers. He said that "non-immigrant labor is not a perfect substitute for immigrant labor because the types of jobs and occupations filled by immigrant labor are lower paying, on average, and many non-immigrants are unlikely to fill those positions unless pay rises substantially." The recent H-1B changes could mean employers look to offshore work or check out other visas. "We will likely push to get employees O-1 visas instead now," one startup founder told Business Insider. A 2023 paper from Britta Glennon, an assistant professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, found that US multinational companies that encounter H-1B visa restrictions tend to ramp up hiring in other countries, especially in China, India, and Canada. Glennon told Business Insider that multinational companies are probably going to ramp up offshore strategies unless they really need talent in the US. "If they're intensifying the offshoring, that's more jobs and investment going abroad, rather than the US," Glennon told Business Insider, adding that such a development would run counter to the intent of the policy changes to visa programs like H-1B. She added that not all employers, including startups and universities, have the resources or option to offshore. Some sectors that rely more on immigration are not growing much. Construction employment has plateaued, for instance. "Immigration policies are definitely impacting labor supply by both pushing out immigrant workers and slowing applications to work in the US," said Martin. "It's too early to know just how many, but we are likely talking hundreds of thousands fewer workers." Kolko said in a recent analysis that employment growth has been flat in construction, home healthcare, and other industries that are more reliant on unauthorized-immigrant labor, with a three-month annualized increase of just 0.06% in August. Other private sectors together had an increase of 0.34%, which is cooler than the 2.2% at the start of the year, as the job market has softened. Tim Paradis contributed to this story. Jump to

Title: Sen. Dick Durbin, Months from Retirement, Becomes First Democrat to Criticize H-1B Visa Program
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/09/27/democrats-begin-to-criticize-h-1b-program-amid-mass-firing-of-americans/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T21:47:14Z

A bipartisan pair of Senators is asking 10 major CEOs to explain why they are hiring Indian and Chinese H-1B migrants while they are also firing skilled American professionals. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions allocated by the H-1B lottery program,” said the September 25 letter signed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL). “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years… At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in the letters. Grassley chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee. Durbin is the top Democrat on the committee and one of the most pro-migration Democrats in Congress. The H-1B issue is becoming toxic for companies as federal data shows rising unemployment among young American graduates. “The Overton Window has shifted,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, which lobbies against the visa programs. He added: In any other year, we would be fighting bad legislation. Now we’re seeing good legislation being introduced… Trump has come a long way from December [when he backed the H-1B program]… On November 10, we’ll have a bunch of tech workers walking around Capitol Hill, speaking to legislative staff, telling what has happened to them… Yeah, we have a lot of momentum. One letter was sent to the CEOs of Amazon, which is the biggest user of H-1B workers. Similar letters were also sent to the CEOs of Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JP Morgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy, and Walmart, which recently faced claims that an Indian executive sold a subcontract to an Indian-run H-1B firm in exchange for kickbacks. The letter asks for responses by October. Some other Democratic-aligned leaders are speaking against the program that keeps roughly 1.2 million foreign workers in the white-collar jobs that are needed by young American couples. “I’ve worked on H-1B politics for 30 years,” said a September 21 X post from Democratic-aligned investor Reed Hastings. “Trump’s $100k per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H-1B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs.” “Once in a great while, our Dear Leader does something half-right,” wrote the far-left editor of The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner: [For example] the H-1B visa program, where Trump abruptly imposed a visa fee of $100,000 per imported worker. The program, on the whole, is a travesty. It’s a modern version of international indentured servitude. Trump’s action was impulsive, weird, and theatrically disruptive rather than reformist. He didn’t say whether it was a one-time or annual fee, and reportedly he hasn’t even figured that out yet. Nonetheless, we’ll take it. “In the case of the H-1B fee, he stumbled into a useful if impulsive action. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day,” said Kuttner’s September 26 comment. Some advocates for businesses are also giving a little ground in the hope that Congress will provide more migrants for tech companies. For example, Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, told Newsweek: Neufeld said it was widely understood that the H-1B has been used to undercut American wages, and that he was hopeful Congress could finally act — at the very least to reform the lottery selection process. “Which is, I think, widely understood to be basically insane that we are deciding who is going to be part of Team America and help drive our economic fortunes by random chance,” he told Newsweek. “We wouldn’t pick our Olympic team by random chance. Why are we picking our high school immigrants this way?” Neufeld’s group is supported by investor-funded foundations. The editorial board at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post is defending the counterproductive program, but also endorses some tinkering: Sen. Jim Banks (R-Indiana), for instance, recently introduced a bill that would similarly raise wage requirements for H-1B holders and replace the visa lottery with a bidding system. Does Trump want a quick win that disappears after he leaves office — or a more comprehensive reform that will last for years to come? Still, pro-migration groups do not want to give any significant concessions to mainstream American voters. For example, Indian immigrant Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) denounced Trump’s modest curbs on the outsourcing program. Trump’s new $100k fee for H-1B visa recipients will completely upend research taking place in WA and across this country. This is bad for our hospitals, our economy, our communities — full stop. But investor groups just want more migrants, “The simplest fix would be to simply raise the annual [H-1B] cap, as Congress did temporarily in the early 2000s,” says a January report by FWD.us, a lobby group for Silicon Valley investors, adding: Congress could exempt priority immigrants, like advanced degree graduates from U.S. schools, from the caps so they do not have to go through the lottery. (Similar exemptions are already in place for employees of nonprofit and government research institutions.) Congress should also create alternative pathways targeted specifically at recruiting and retaining graduates and STEM experts, thereby moving them out of the H-1B process. This should include a true post-graduation work visa option for international students to begin their careers in the U.S., separate from training programs like OPT, as well as a dedicated green card option on the basis of a U.S. education. Similar visa options should be established for STEM experts seeking to work in industries critical to national security and global competitiveness, and for entrepreneurs ready to launch new companies and create jobs in the U.S. Investors gain from migration because the arrival of more consumers, renters, and workers generates more business activity, regardless of damage to productivity, innovation, wage levels, crime, or Americans’ ability to form and raise families. “The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” said a September 19 proclamation by Trump establishing modest curbs on the H-1B program: The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa. … The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States.

Title: Tech billionaire defends massive H-1B labor pipeline, warns Trump’s reforms will ‘backfire’

By Amanda Bartolotta September 27, 2025 Michael Moritz, the billionaire venture capitalist and longtime Silicon Valley insider, published an opinion piece in the Financial Times attacking President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions. Moritz claimed the policy would damage America’s tech industry rather than protect U.S. workers. In a dramatic flourish, he likened the White House to The Sopranos, calling the fee a “caper” and accusing the administration of failing to understand “why the U.S., especially its technology sector, has worked so well.” This debate is about more than Moritz’s claims. It reveals how language can be used to reframe the issue, obscure accountability and pressure policymakers into surrendering leverage to global capital at America’s expense. Moritz is only the latest voice using familiar arguments that have long perpetuated harm to U.S. workers. The difference is that the facts, unlike opinions, can be tested, verified and held up against the record. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The blurred line between ‘skill shortage’ and ‘labor arbitrage’ Moritz argues that big tech “hires foreign nationals because they possess particular skills” and fill “areas where the U.S. has labor shortages.” But the so-called “skilled worker” narrative surrounding the H-1B visa is a total and provable myth. The H-1B program was originally pitched as a way for U.S. companies to bring in highly skilled workers when no qualified Americans could be found. But decades of evidence show that corporations use it not to fill rare gaps, but to import cheaper labor and displace U.S. professionals. Even the program’s mechanics point away from merit. The H-1B system allocates visas by random lottery, not by skill, wage level or national need. Instead, it’s the luck of the draw, not merit that wins out. The records that employers submit to the Department of Labor through the so-called PERM process tell a much different story. PERM (Permanent Labor Certification) is the only stage wherein employers are legally required to test the U.S. labor market before sponsoring a foreign national for permanent residency. If there truly were a skilled labor shortage, corporations would embrace that safeguard. Instead, they cleverly design myriad ways to avoid finding qualified Americans. Job ads are drafted with inflated requirements that few domestic candidates will meet. Notices are intentionally placed where they are unlikely to be seen. Ads are run only in the bare-minimum formats required by regulation. And after layoffs, companies like Google and Amazon simply pause PERM filings to avoid having to offer jobs back to the Americans they just terminated, a tactic openly advised by immigration attorneys. Moritz reinforces his point by listing “warehouse workers, account managers, brand specialists and dishwashers” as the kinds of jobs Americans hold. The effect is to suggest that only foreign workers fill demanding roles such as biochemists, software engineers and other high-skill positions, while Americans are concentrated in lower-level work. This framing makes U.S. layoffs and new H-1B requests appear unrelated, as if the Americans being cut were never in the same labor pool and therefore didn’t qualify for the legal notice requirement. Evidence from ongoing litigation shows otherwise. One company email cited 209 employees whose layoffs created a legal barrier to sponsoring foreign nationals in those same roles. Despite acknowledging the requirement to notify displaced Americans, the company treated them as an obstacle to be managed, rather than candidates to be rehired. This contrast with the H-1B program is critical. Unlike PERM, H-1B petitions do not require any recruitment or labor market test. Employers can file directly for foreign workers without demonstrating that no qualified Americans are available. The way companies work around the one safeguard that does exist indicates that qualified Americans are indeed available, but employers simply choose not to hire them. Impact of Layoffs on the PERM Process ‘Every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts’? Moritz’s claims that undergraduate degrees from Eastern Europe, Turkey or India are “every bit as well qualified” as American degrees do not stand up to global data. In the “QS World University Rankings 2026,” U.S. institutions dominate the top tier, with MIT ranked #1 for the 13th consecutive year and over 40 U.S. universities in the top 200. By contrast, India’s highest-ranked school, IIT Delhi, sits at 123rd and most Indian universities fall far lower. The Times Higher Education 2025 rankings show a similar pattern: The U.S. holds 7 of the top 10 universities worldwide, while India’s best performer, IISc Bangalore, is ranked in the 201-250 band, with the majority falling 600+ or unranked. Quality concerns are reflected in employability data. Studies show that of Indian engineering graduates, approximately 94% lack the skills required for employment, with only 4.77% able to complete a basic programming task. These findings contrast sharply with Moritz’s assertion and raise questions about the pipeline that supplies roughly three out of every four H-1B visas. Opinion doesn’t conceal facts: Documented cases of replacement Moritz insists that U.S. companies do not hire H-1B workers “to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons.” But documented cases prove otherwise. In 2015, Disney made headlines when IT employees were ordered to train H-1B replacements supplied by HCL. At Southern California Edison, hundreds of American IT roles were cut and replaced with H-1B contractors. The University of California required career staff to train incoming HCL hires. AT&T, after a $3 billion tax cut, expanded its outsourcing partnerships, displacing more than 16,000 Americans and closing 44 call centers. At Bank of America, the company acknowledged requiring U.S. employees to train foreign replacements, calling it “essential for knowledge transfer.” One employee, Kevin Flanagan, took his own life after being forced to train his foreign replacement, underscoring the human toll of these practices. These are just a few of many verifiable cases, not anecdotes. They demonstrate a pattern in which American workers are displaced while visa pipelines remain open and expanding. It’s all about cheap labor, not ‘rare skills’ Supporters often frame H-1B hiring as access to rare, high-end talent. But the government’s own data shows otherwise. Employers must classify H-1B jobs under one of four prevailing wage levels: Level 1 is “entry level,” while Level 4 reflects senior, fully competent roles. Employer records reveal that 83% of H-1B registrations fall into Levels I and II, both below the U.S. median wage. In computer and mathematical jobs, the single largest category, 271,000 of 315,000 filings, were placed at these lowest levels. Even in business and finance, nearly 80% landed at Levels I and II. Across the top five job categories, as little as 14% were classified at Levels III and IV. If the program were truly about filling rare shortages, employers would be filing at higher wage levels. Instead, filings cluster overwhelmingly at the bottom. The data shows that the H-1B program functions as a pipeline for lower-cost labor on a massive scale. India’s government confirms: H-1B fuels exports, not shortages In a Bloomberg article titled “India Seeks Access for Workers in US Trade Talks After H1B Blow”, Indian officials openly acknowledge the real function of the H-1B program. India Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told U.S. negotiators that the “mobility of skilled workers” is vital to India’s services exports. In plain terms, the H-1B program is not being used to solve America’s skill shortages; it is a pipeline that converts U.S. jobs into India’s export product. And the vehicle making this possible is not trade law, but America’s own immigration system. The report also shows that India views Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee not as an obstacle to filling U.S. skill shortages, but as a direct threat to its $280-billion tech services industry. For American workers, the consequences are twofold. First, jobs are lost at home when companies bring in lower-cost visa holders. Second, those same roles are exported overseas under the banner of “services,” turning U.S. employment into an international commodity. The hard truth: The H-1B program fails to protect Americans Moritz argues that U.S. law protects citizens from being replaced by H-1Bs. In reality, the program is structured in ways that leave Americans exposed. Employers are generally not required to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1Bs. Only a narrow subset of “H-1B-dependent” employers face additional rules, and those rules contain significant loopholes. Mst companies simply attest that they will not displace U.S. workers in the exact same job classification. Nothing prevents them from laying off staff in one unit while filling nearly identical roles with H-1Bs through outsourcing vendors. The Department of Labor’s Inspector General has reported widespread fraud and abuse in the program and found oversight grossly insufficient. The result is a system where violations are frequent, consequences rare and displacement, both direct and indirect, widespread. Veiled threats: The implied ultimatum Moritz warns that “advances in technology mean that it is less important for the tech companies to bring workers to America,” implying that if the U.S. restricts visas, companies will simply take the work abroad. Such statements raise questions about corporate loyalty to their country, America. With U.S. consumers generating the majority of revenue, the suggestion that jobs can simply be shifted elsewhere overlooks the role of American workers and taxpayers in building these companies. If firms choose to move operations overseas, policymakers could require repayment of subsidies, grants and tax breaks and retention of patents developed with U.S. funding. Policy makers should also implement new policies on offshoring and safeguarding American data from being transferred abroad, where privacy protections are weak or unenforceable. Narrative capture disguised as innovation Michael Moritz argues that the Trump administration should not shrink the H-1B program but instead double or triple visa numbers and automatically grant U.S. citizenship to foreign nationals earning PhDs in STEM fields from top American universities. He frames this as essential to keeping top talent from leaving for other countries. However, proposals of this kind would expand the supply of foreign labor, lock in employer access to it and make it more difficult for policymakers to reduce numbers later. Each step strengthens corporate reliance on foreign workers rather than on the domestic labor force. When Moritz and others call for increasing visa numbers under the banner of “economic fundamentals,” the result is an expanded supply of lower-cost labor for corporations. In this framework, “innovation” becomes linked less to investing in American workers and more to enlarging the pool of foreign labor that can be brought in. \ Moritz also points to his own immigration story as evidence that visa pipelines should be widened. Even after nearly 50 years in the United States and despite clear benefits from the American economy, his framing suggests that assimilation and citizenship are optional. In this view, American loyalty and sovereignty take a back seat to profit. Being American in America appears conditional, valued only so long as it aligns with higher financial returns. If greater profits can be found elsewhere, America itself is presented as interchangeable, or even for sale. Moritz’s op-ed frames resistance as xenophobic, backward or disconnected from “global realities,” while presenting the movement of jobs abroad as the natural fallback. Yet America’s strength has historically come from deliberate design, sovereignty and investment in its own workforce. The fortunes of the investor class were built on this foundation, even as current arguments push in the exact opposite direction. Moritz portrays his stance as safeguarding talent, but the emphasis aligns consistently with safeguarding financial returns. Restoring America’s promise The debate over H-1B visas is not about talent, progress or global competitiveness. It is about whether the United States will continue to sell out its workers, its sovereignty and its future for the short-term profits of the investor class. Michael Moritz’s arguments highlight a worldview where citizenship, assimilation and American loyalty are treated as optional and where the nation’s worth is reduced to margins on a balance sheet. The United States and its citizens were never meant to be interchangeable with others. The country was built on purpose, pride and sacrifice. Its strength has always come from investing in its own people, defending its sovereignty and ensuring that opportunity belongs first to the citizens who built and sustained it. If America is to secure the next century, policymakers must stop treating the displacement of American workers as collateral damage and start addressing it as the true national emergency it is. Immigration policy must serve the interests of American citizens, not the balance sheets of multinational corporations or the export ambitions of foreign governments. The choice is to stand with American workers or surrender the nation’s future. To keep the United States free, strong and sovereign, its leaders must protect American jobs, innovation and people – because America is not for sale.

About us Copy link Digital asset treasuries have become crypto’s hottest trade, with over 200 companies now holding billions in tokens on their balance sheets. But investors are calculating the same metric called mNAV in such different ways that this has created a hall of mirrors where the same stock can look like a 90% discount or a 500% premium. The problem isn’t trivial since investors are making million-dollar-bets based on data that’s off by multiples. The article below written by pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains how to make sense of this complex metric and trade it accurately. mNAV is short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple. It tells you how much equity value you’re paying for every $1 of crypto the company holds. mNAV = Fully Diluted MarketCap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) We run it three ways: Realized: shares that exist today Realistic: realized plus in-the-money dilution (options, warrants, convertibles, RSUs) Maximum: everything that could possibly printAll three are often incorrectly used interchangeably by people when discussing “fully diluted” sharecounts, marketcaps, and mNAVs. In practice, doing so inevitably leads to miscommunication, disagreement, and, most consequentially, trades executed without full knowledge of what the true values actually are. The lens you pick to perceive through will change the picture in potentially radical ways. Realized can look like a discount. Maximum often will show the extreme or “worst-case” scenario of a premium. The HYPE DAT ecosystem is one of the clearest examples of why mNAV matters and how it gets misread, miscalculated, and, even, misreported. The three main HYPE treasury plays right now are: HYPD (Hyperion DeFi), SONN (soon to merge into Hyperliquid Strategies, HSI), and LGHL (Lion Group). Galaxy Digital (GLXY) also holds HYPE however because of its broader business mix, it’s been left out deliberately as it is not a pure DAT-focused trade. Depending on which share count you use to calculate for marketcaps, these stocks can look like deep discounts or expensive premiums. One investor will say SONN is 0.06x. Another will say it’s 5.27x. Both are technically right. They’re just using different denominators.That contrast is exactly why the HYPE DATs make for a clean case study. We’ll break down each company, walk through the math, and show where people can get tripped up. Treasury: 1,535,772 HYPE × $48 = $73,717,056 Price: $10.34 Takeaway: On realized shares HYPD trades at 0.79x. That’s a discount. Once you layer in dilution it jumps to 5–8x, which is firmly premium. Treasury: 12,600,000 HYPE × $48 = $604,800,000 Price: $5.66 Takeaway: On today’s count SONN screens at 0.06x. That’s a massive discount. On the real post-merge base it’s a 5.27x premium. Same stock, two different answers. Treasury: - 194,726 HYPE × $48 = $9,346,848- 6,707 SOL × $220 = $1,475,540- Total = $10,822,388Price: $1.43 Takeaway: On realized and realistic shares LGHL trades under 0.1x. That’s a steep discount. On maximum it jumps to 4x premium. The swing is all about which share count you pick. Informed decision making becomes paramount when you consider such discrepancies. Yahoo currently shows: Three different answers from the same site. Now convert the float to ADS instead of ordinary:- 904,930,000 ÷ 2,500 = 361,972 ADS- Marketcap = $517,622- mNAV = 0.0478x Still wrong, but at least consistent. The correct counts from filings are 737,193 ADS (realized), 742,993 ADS (realistic), and 30,406,496 ADS (maximum). Those give 0.0974x, 0.0982x, and 4.0177x. Lesson: Yahoo Finance mixes units and lags filings. Always go back to the SEC. Key: <1x = Discount- 1x = Equal- >1x = Premium mNAV is the backbone of the DAT trade. It won’t replace judgment, but it grounds it. With clean numbers you know when you’re buying tokens at a discount, equal value, or paying a premium. That’s the difference between trading narratives and trading based on numbers. Prices move fast, narratives move faster, but underneath all the noise each ticker is just a wrapper around a pile of tokens. If you’re sloppy with the numbers, you’ll fool yourself. Everyone wants the shortcut. Use today’s SONN share count instead of the post-merge count and it’ll look like a steal at 0.06x. In reality, it’s a 5.27x premium. Take LGHL’s ordinary shares and multiply them by the ADS price and, suddenly, you end up with mNAVs in the hundreds or thousands of x. Rely on Yahoo’s “float” line and you may as well be pulling numbers out of thin air. The fix is simple. Stick with filings, pick your lens, and stay consistent or simply use DeFiLlama. This way you’ll actually know if you’re buying tokens at a discount, equal value, or paying a premium. mNAV won’t tell you everything. Sentiment, liquidity, and timing all still very much matter and should be factored in for. mNAV alone won’t replace judgment, but it grounds it. With clean numbers, you know when you’re buying tokens at a discount, equal value, or paying a premium. That’s how you avoid chasing what can look like free money and then getting steamrolled when the market reprices overnight. The edge in DATs is about doing the math right using the most-up-to-date data while others cut corners. All the mNAVs on DeFiLlama’s website are standardized to using tokens only, which is simpler to calculate but not the same as Enterprise Value as such you may find discrepancies when comparing mNAV values from MSTR’s website for example. Always check to see if there is an express mention of what variables are being utilized to calculate a reported mNAV when dealing with different sources.

Title: Kingspan chases Magnificent Seven energy with plan to float unit riding on AI boom

Fed up with Kingspan shares drifting behind peers and the wider market, Gene Murtagh is seeking to tap into some of the energy of the Magnificent Seven (Mag-7), the US tech stocks that have driven a three-year bull run across global equity markets. The Kingspan chief executive revealed on Tuesday that the insulation giant founded 60 years ago by his father, Eugene, plans to float 25 per cent of its advanced building systems unit Advnsys, which is focused on supplying the global data centres boom, in Amsterdam. The mushrooming of data centres has been turbocharged by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that has driven the share prices in recent times of Mag-7 stalwarts such as chipmaker Nvidia, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet and Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram. Close to $7 trillion (€6 trillion) will need to be spent on data centres globally by 2030, driven by demand for hubs equipped to handle AI processing loads, McKinsey, the management consultancy firm, estimated in a recent report. “We’re acutely cognisant of the fact that relevant sector peers – and these are not building sector peers, they’re tech-end peers that are supplying the data centre market – are trading at and above 20 times Ebitda,” Murtagh said on a call with analysts, referring to how others in the data centre space are being valued by the stock market at more than 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Valuing Advnsys along these lines would give it an initial market capitalisation of at least €6 billion. [ Kingspan shares soar on potential €6bn flotation of unit riding data centres boomOpens in new window ] Kingspan had lost more than a third of its market value in the four years before the move was announced – and was down 21 per cent on the year as it grappled with what Murtagh recently described as an ongoing “pretty unforgiving environment” for construction suppliers globally as households and businesses fret about a potential recession. The group is trading at about 10 times Ebitda – compared with its 10-year average of 13.5. Compare that with Vertiv, an Ohio-based provider of critical infrastructure and services for data centres, whose stock has soared more than 400 per cent over the past four years. Or with Trane Technologies, the Swords-headquartered but New York-listed maker of heating and cooling systems for commercial buildings, whose market value has more than doubled in the same period, to $90 billion, amid a surge in demand for its data centre air-cooling systems. The AI boom – like red-hot stock market trends before it – has attracted blatantly cynical pivots and rebrands from companies trying to jump on the bandwagon. But Kingspan has been a supplier to the data centres market since before Murtagh became CEO 20 years ago. The new Advnsys unit being lined up for an initial public offering (IPO) – which combines its data centre solutions and light, air and water businesses into one – is a world leader in bespoke critical infrastructure primarily focused on data centres, ventilation and daylighting. [ Kingspan trades profit for position in US roofing raceOpens in new window ] While about 40 per cent of Advnsys’s earnings currently come from providing infrastructure to the tech sector, particularly to data centres, this is expected to grow to about 75 per cent of an even bigger business in the next three to five years, according to the group. Citigroup analysts reckon the subsidiary could more than double its revenue and Ebitda between 2024 and 2030, to €3.2 billion and €525 million, respectively. Shares in Kingspan jumped as much as 13.5 per cent to €74.85 on Tuesday morning, but have since handed back almost half their gains as some analysts urged caution. “While we understand the [market] reaction, particularly in light of the stock’s weaker performance year-to-date, we do not yet understand how a partial IPO creates additional value, nor how the market will arbitrage valuation between the two businesses,” said JP Morgan analysts led by Elodie Rall in a note to clients. Advnsys may attract a higher valuation multiple, but this is likely to be offset by the market giving the rest of the business – comprising insulated panels, other insulation solutions and its roofing and waterproofing unit – a lower one, she said. [ Kingspan plans €650m share buy back as half year revenues rise 8% to record €4.5bnOpens in new window ] Bernstein’s Pujarini Ghosh said the market excitement earlier in the week had been “overdone” and her €70 price target on the group points to almost 3 per cent downside from here. A listing of Advnsys in New York “could potentially have helped unlock greater value given the business mix will be more heavily skewed to the US”, she said. About 45 per cent of the unit’s business is exposed to the US, but this is expected to rise well above 50 per cent in the coming years. Murtagh said the decision to float on Euronext Amsterdam is down to the high level of trading in stocks in that market, a lack of stamp duty there, too, and how the same accounting standard (IFRS) applies to companies in the Netherlands and Ireland. For sure, the level of trading in Euronext Dublin has slumped over the past five years amid a number of company exits and a dearth of fresh IPOs. [ How Kingspan stands to benefit from AI boomOpens in new window ] But to avoid the 1 per cent stamp duty applied to share trading in Irish companies, Kingspan will need to incorporate Advnsys as a public limited company – or naamloze vennootschap (NV) – in the Netherlands. A nice bonus from the planned IPO is that it would, according to Murtagh. leave both Kingspan and Advnsys “essentially with zero debt” – giving them plenty of scope to invest and grow by acquisition. Whereas Kingspan’s share price tends to move with the broader construction industry cycle, Advnsys’s stock will be far more sensitive to developments in AI, making it potentially much more volatile. Chinese tech group DeepSeek, for example, showed the world earlier this year that its approach to generative AI needs just a fraction of the computing power of more prominent US tools, such as ChatGPT. Could demand for data centres decline as AI systems become more efficient? One thing’s for sure: savvy investors in Advnsys in Amsterdam will have alerts set for anything coming from another company 9,000km away. For now, Nvidia in Santa Clara, California, remains the bellwether for all things AI.

Title: Online Selling 101: How To Start & Where To Sell Fast
URL: https://www.dumblittleman.com/online-selling/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T04:00:12Z
Full Content:
September 27, 2025 • Fact checked by Dumb Little Man Let’s be real—online selling is everywhere, and if you’re not in the game yet, you’re leaving money on the table. People are no longer waiting in lines at the mall. They’re scrolling, clicking, and expecting their shop orders to land on their doorstep in two days. And honestly? It’s never been easier to jump in and start selling yourself. Here’s the thing: an online business doesn’t mean you need to rent a big warehouse or hire a team overnight. It means you can create an online store, list your items, and have buyers finding you with just a few clicks. With platforms giving you powerful tools and resources, you can sell smarter and reach new customers without drowning in startup costs. Since buyers love popular products, especially when they see recent sales, you’ll be in a position to score more sales faster than you think. Why has this model gained popularity? Because it’s flexible, affordable, and scalable. Sellers can sell online while working full-time jobs, during college, or even between Netflix streams. The barriers are low, the demand is high, and the opportunities? Endless. You just need the right mindset, a little hustle, and the right tools to make it work. So grab your coffee and your ambition—because I’m about to walk you through how to start online selling, where to sell, and the exact steps to make your store shine. An online store is basically your digital shopfront. Instead of opening in a mall, you’re open in the world—24/7. With the right setup, you can sell almost anything, from clothes to electronics to handmade crafts. And because the buyer pays upfront, you get to skip a lot of the messy in-person transactions that eat up time and energy. Here’s what makes an online store work: you create a space where buyers can scroll through your listing, check reviews, and hit checkout without ever leaving their couch. And the good news? You don’t need to be a tech genius. Platforms like eBay, Etsy, and Facebook Marketplace make it easy to create a store that works in minutes. With the right setup, you’re basically in business overnight. Why is an online store so powerful? Because it gives you a chance to build your brand, showcase quality products, and reach new customers. With smart design, fair price points, and reliable shipping, your store becomes a place people trust. The trust you build here equals more buyers and more sales, and trust me—people return to stores they believe in. An online store isn’t just a website; it’s your entry ticket into a booming market. Done right, it becomes your personal empire, one click at a time. The biggest question every seller asks is: “What do I sell?” Here’s the magic: you need to identify trending products before everyone else jumps in. That’s how you land more sales and new customers who are desperate to buy. If you wait until the whole world knows about a product, you’ll be competing with thousands of sellers—and your store risks getting lost. Your best friend here? Google Trends. It shows what’s hot, what’s not, and what trends are picking up steam. For example, if you see increased interest in self care gadgets or outdoor activities gear, you know there’s a growing trend worth chasing. The earlier you catch it, the more you stand out in a crowded marketplace. But don’t confuse quick fads with consistent demand. A phone case that goes viral might change quickly, but skincare tools with steady interest? That’s gold. The trick is knowing which specific products belong to which product category. And yes, this takes research, not guesswork. Here’s the tea: trending products come and go, but the sellers who learn to track trends and react fast? They’re the ones who get better results. Google Trends isn’t just a graph; it’s your crystal ball for business growth. So, you’ve seen some trending products on Google Trends—but hold up. Before you rush to list them, you need to pick the right product category. Why? Because your category is the foundation of your store, your listings, and your brand. Without a clear focus, you’ll confuse your buyers and limit your sales potential. A solid product category makes it easier to create targeted listings, attract the right buyers, and build consistent demand. Some hot categories right now include: These categories don’t just spike—they show a growing trend and loyal customers who come back for more. When you pick wisely, you’ll have a reliable lane for your brand and a clear market to target. But here’s the warning: don’t just chase hype. Trending products that vanish overnight can leave you with unsold inventory. Instead, balance hype with stability. Choose a category that has both popular products and long-term demand, so your store thrives today and in the future. Now let’s talk money—because your business of online selling isn’t a hobby once you’ve got a proper account. Step one? Open a dedicated bank account. You need it to process payments safely and keep your finances clean. Mixing your business with your personal spending is a rookie mistake, and it’ll make taxes a nightmare. Step two: set up an account on platforms where you want to sell online. Whether it’s eBay, Amazon, or a Facebook shop, each one has its own rules. The key is making sure that when the buyer pays, the money goes straight into your bank account without hiccups. Nothing kills a vibe faster than missing payments. Step three: don’t ignore fees. Some platforms take a cut every time an item sells, so you need to calculate price points wisely. That means understanding your category, knowing your costs for shipping, and setting a price that covers expenses while still attracting buyers. The company you choose to host your store will also determine how you process payments, so read the fine print. When you’ve got your accounts set up properly, you can finally focus on sales instead of stressing over transactions. That’s how you turn your hustle into a legit business with steady revenue. And honestly? That’s the glow-up you came here for. Your listings are the heart of your store. A sloppy post with bad photos and vague details won’t get you buyers. But a polished, clear listing? That’s where the magic happens, and that’s how you rack up sales. Start with visuals. High-quality images sell. Show the product from different angles, include close-ups, and keep the background simple. This helps buyers trust the quality of what they see. Add reviews if you have them—social proof is everything when convincing new customers to hit “buy now.” Next up: the description. Be specific. Cover the product category, size, materials, and any key features. Avoid fluff and focus on what makes this item sell. Make sure your listing is easy to read with bullet points, so people can skim and still get the info. Adding keywords that match what buyers search for in your market helps you appear higher in results. Finally, the price. Research competitors in your marketplace, compare price points, and set something fair. Too cheap, and people question quality. Too high, and you lose buyers. Get it right, and you’ll see more sales roll in, especially when paired with clear shipping options and transparent timelines. Okay, let’s talk logistics. If your shipping is a mess, your store won’t survive. Customers want fast, reliable delivery, and if they don’t get it, they’ll leave a bad review that scares off more buyers. Good shipping equals repeat sales, and repeat sales are the backbone of a sustainable business. First, pick reliable carriers and offer tracking. This gives your buyers peace of mind knowing their item sells and ships safely. Step two: manage your inventory. Keep track of stock levels so you don’t oversell and disappoint customers. Running out is bad, but overselling is worse. Use tools that alert you when stock runs low to stay ahead. Packaging matters too. Deliver quality by using sturdy boxes, bubble wrap, or eco-friendly materials if that’s part of your brand. Popular products deserve packaging that matches their value. Remember, unboxing is part of the experience, and it can help attract loyal buyers who love sharing it on social media. With organized inventory and solid shipping, your store will run smoother. You’ll stress less, your buyers will be happier, and you’ll build a reputation for reliability. And trust me, reliability = more sales and better results. Now the juicy part—where should you actually sell online? Luckily, there are tons of marketplaces that make it easy to reach more buyers. But not all are created equal, so let’s break it down. Each marketplace has its own rules, fees, and tools, so choose based on your product category and audience. Some work better for popular products with consistent demand, while others are a test ground for new products. The key is picking platforms that match your brand and give you better results. When you choose the right marketplace, you’ll not only start online selling faster but also expand your reach and build success for the future. Here’s the truth—social media isn’t just for memes and selfies anymore. It’s one of the most powerful tools sellers have to grow their stores. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok are basically free billboards where you can promote your brand, showcase listings, and grab the attention of new customers. Want more buyers? Post content that shows your quality products in action. People love seeing how an item sells in real life. Add behind-the-scenes stories, review highlights, or unboxing clips to spark interest. These posts make your brand relatable and trustworthy. To make social work for you, here are some tips: But don’t just post and ghost. Engage! Reply to comments, answer questions, and build a community around your store. A loyal community not only buys from you but also helps you promote your shop for free. Done right, social isn’t optional—it’s essential for modern business. Numbers don’t lie, and if you want success, you need to know what they’re saying. Tracking recent sales, reading reviews, and watching trends give you the clearest picture of what’s working in your store. It’s like having a GPS in the wild jungle of e-commerce—you know exactly where to go instead of guessing. Start by checking your listings. Which item sells the fastest? Which ones are collecting dust? Which products bring in new customers consistently? These patterns tell you where to double down and where to back off. Pair this info with Google Trends to see where increased interest is showing up in your product category. If you see demand rising, stock up before the buyers shift their focus. Then come the reviews. Honestly, they’re gold. They reveal what buyers love, what they hate, and what they wish was different. Use these insights to adjust your price, improve quality, or update your packaging. Ignoring reviews is a mistake that costs you sales—feedback is literally free coaching. By tracking sales data and monitoring trends, you’re not just online selling—you’re making informed decisions that put you ahead in the market. Knowledge is your edge, and the sellers who study their numbers always win the long game. Short-term wins are thrilling, but long-term success is the real goal. Once your store has a steady rhythm, it’s time to expand. That can mean adding new products, exploring another product category, or even launching your own website to step outside big marketplaces. Growth takes planning, not luck. The secret sauce? Build a brand that people trust. Shoppers don’t just buy items; they buy loyalty, values, and reputation. When buyers feel connected to your brand, they’ll keep coming back, leave glowing reviews, and tell their friends. That kind of trust creates a ripple effect—bringing in more buyers without extra effort. Automation is your best friend here. Use tools to manage inventory, streamline shipping, and track sales. The less time you spend on repetitive tasks, the more time you have to create growth strategies and focus on scaling your business. It’s about working smarter, not harder. Remember: online selling is a marathon, not a sprint. If you focus on building steadily, your store won’t just survive—it’ll thrive as trends evolve. Sustainable growth is the kind that sets you up for the future, and that’s where true domination happens. Let’s spill the tea—new sellers often sabotage themselves without realizing it. Some mistakes are small, but others can ruin your chances of success if you don’t catch them early. So, here’s the list of what not to do. Avoid these pitfalls, and you’ll be way ahead of most beginners. Learn fast, stay sharp, and remember—buyers reward sellers who are reliable, polished, and prepared. Don’t let silly mistakes block your path to long-term success. Here’s the truth: online selling isn’t just a side hustle anymore—it’s a full-blown opportunity to build real success. Whether you’re listing on eBay, promoting on Facebook, or running your own website, the chance to sell and earn is massive. But it all comes down to whether you’re ready to start. The winning formula? Pick a solid product category, use the right tools, set fair price points, and deliver quality products. Manage your shipping, stay on top of your inventory, and actually listen to buyers through reviews. These habits build trust, bring in new customers, and lead to more sales. So, are you ready to jump in? Stop watching from the sidelines while others cash out. Create your store, claim your corner of the market, and go after it. The future of e-commerce is already here—and it’s wide open for anyone with hustle. Your business deserves to shine. Don’t just scroll. Sell. And sell like you mean it.
