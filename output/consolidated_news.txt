Title: BlackRock: The puppet master behind Kamala Harris

Time Published: 2024-09-24T01:00:00Z

Lifestyle by Blaze Media The only 'opportunity economy' the veep represents is the one letting Big Finance keep gutting the middle class. Kamala Harris is not a comedian, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. During the recent presidential debate, the tireless TikToker somehow managed to maintain a straight face while pledging to create an "opportunity economy" for the middle class. Yet, this promise rings hollow when both she and President Biden are deeply entangled with BlackRock, a firm notorious for crushing the very group she claims to uplift. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? In short, BlackRock has used its vast financial influence to sway political decisions, control market outcomes, and prioritize profits over the interests of everyday people. It's the puppet master behind the scenes, shaping policies that favor the elite while leaving the middle class to foot the bill. Harris' cozy relationship with BlackRock exposes her "opportunity economy" as nothing more than a smokescreen for serving the powerful. The facts speak for themselves. Harris' two top economic advisers, Michael Pyle and Brian Deese, were key players at BlackRock. Both weredrafted last month, likely to help her craft policies in anticipation of a potential presidency. As for Joe Biden, since taking office, he has surrounded himself with former BlackRock executives, embedding the financial giant's influence at the highest levels of government. Take Michael Pyle, once BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist, who recently served as U.S. deputy national security adviser for international economics. In this critical role, Pyle directed the administration's international economic policy and acted as Biden’s key representative, or “sherpa,” at the G7 and G20 summits. His sway over global economic strategy was significant. Before this, Pyle helped shape domestic policy as Harris’ chief economic adviser during the administration's disastrous first year. His deep ties to BlackRock underscore the firm’s growing grip on the Biden administration's decision-making, further aligning government policy with Wall Street’s interests. Last week BlackRock announced that it was rehiring Pyle as deputy head of it's $3.2 trillion portfolio management group. And let’s not forget Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo, another key player in the Biden administration. Currently serving as deputy secretary of the treasury, the 43-year-old was once Larry Fink'sright-hand man at BlackRock. During his time at the investment giant, Adeyemo acted as a senior adviser and led the firm's public policy team, directly shaping BlackRock’s strategy in navigating government relations and regulatory frameworks. His current role places him in a powerful position to influence U.S. financial policy. Then there's Eric Van Nostrand, a former BlackRock executive now serving as a senior adviser under Biden on economic issues related to Russia and Ukraine,as reported by Bloomberg. Since Van Nostrand’s appointment, BlackRock’s interest and involvement in Ukraine have suspiciously intensified, with the firm advising on reconstruction efforts and channeling investment into critical sectors. BlackRock's history suggests this support is far from altruistic. The firm has a notorious track record of capitalizing on geopolitical crises for financial gain, rather than genuinely aiding nations in need. Much like itsexploitative role during the 2008 financial crisis, when BlackRock profited from the collapse it helped precipitate, the firm now stands to benefit from Ukraine’s instability. Its influence over Kyiv’s policies, including the deregulation of urban planning, paves the way for corporate interests to exploit a rather dire situation. It doesn’t stop at Ukraine. BlackRock isn’t just funding the destabilization of democracies abroad — it’s actively helping China, a regime that poses an existential threat to American interests. The Coalition for a Prosperous America has revealed how BlackRock funnels billions into Chinese companies, many linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. This raises alarming questions about national security and America’s economic sovereignty. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? Certainly not with the average American family struggling to make ends meet. As if that weren't enough, BlackRock’s involvement in the U.S. military-industrial complex adds another layer to its nefarious influence. As highlighted by researchers at Corporate Accountability, an organization committed to exposing corporations that undermine democracy, BlackRock holds tens of billions in investments in major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. By profiting directly from never-ending wars, BlackRock reaps enormous financial rewards while American taxpayers are left to foot the bill. Which brings us back to Kamala Harris. For all her posturing, the flip-flopper-in-chief is not here to challenge this system. She’s here to safeguard it. If elected, Harris' economic policies will be molded by the same firm responsible for widening income inequality and eroding democracy. The Wall Street Journal has shed light on how BlackRock has amassed entire residential neighborhoods, turning these homes into rental properties. This aggressive acquisition strategy fuels bidding wars and drives up home prices, directly disadvantaging the middle class. As Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale professor, has pointed out, Kamala Harris’ ties to Wall Street are even more intimate than Biden’s. And when Wall Street speaks, it’s really BlackRock’s voice you’re hearing. Harris’ campaign promises to support the middle class appear to be nothing more than a boldfaced lie. But this is what she excels at: bending the truth. Make no mistake about it: BlackRock’s interests are diametrically opposed to those of the American people. A Harris presidency would mean more policies that enrich the few at the expense of the many. Kamala Harris isn’t the answer; on the contrary, she’s part of the problem. John Mac Ghlionn

“He can't [negotiate] because he's owned by the West, by Washington, by London, by BlackRock, by the military industrial complex, so they're not gonna let him do that,” he continued. “They are making money out of this war and getting everything they can out of Ukraine and out of the resources that Ukraine has. So he has no other possibility. He could have stopped it as soon as he became the president in 2019.” “I fled this war because I was against this war and my government – the regime, the Kiev Nazi regime – tried to kill me for fighting for peace,” he continued. “A lot of Ukrainians who fled this war, they fled it because… they just don't want to fight, but they want to continue this war so they have the pride of Ukraine winning, and that is it. They don't understand the consequences. The consequences are a World War III situation. Ukraine cannot win this, and Ukraine already has lost when the war started, day one.”

Title: Wall Street ends slightly higher after Fed policymakers back rate cuts

NEW YORK – US stocks closed modestly higher on Sept 23 as investors assessed whether a trend will develop in the week following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. The gains came amid comments from Fed policymakers and steady factory activity data, building on last week’s sharp market rally after the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates. The Fed’s pivotal move last week pushed major indexes to monthly gains, defying the historical trend of September as a weak month for equities. Comments on Sept 23 from three reserve bank presidents were the main focus as investors searched for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis-point cut. Fed officials including Mr Raphael Bostic, Mr Neel Kashkari and Mr Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Trader bets, as per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, initially favoured a larger Fed move at its upcoming November meeting, after Governor Christopher Waller on Sept 20 flagged that upcoming inflation data could undershoot the Fed’s 2 per cent target. However, the bets have swayed since then and now appear to be a coin-toss, with markets expecting a total reduction of 74 basis points by the year end, according to LSEG data. On the data front, US business activity remained steady in September, while average prices for goods and services increased at the fastest pace in six months, potentially signalling a rise in inflation in the months ahead. “I think investors are still just sort of taking a wait-and-see attitude, if indeed a soft landing is the most likely outcome.” said Mr Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.29 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 42,124.65, the S&P 500 gained 16.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 5,718.57 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 25.95 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 17,974.27. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy stocks led gains with a 1.31 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.25 per cent. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.65 per cent, while Meta Platforms rose 0.6 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. The Russell 2000 index, tracking small caps, was off 0.25 per cent. All eyes are on Sept 27’s personal consumption expenditures figure for August – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts say this release will be the week’s most significant catalyst. Among top movers, Intel rose 3.05 per cent after a media report said Apollo offered to make an investment of as much as US$5 billion (S$6.46 billion) in the chipmaker. General Motors slipped 1.72 per cent after Bernstein downgraded the carmaker’s stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 505 new highs and 36 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 62 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 123 new lows.

Title: Goldman Sachs maintains buy on Arista Networks, price target $430
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/goldman-sachs-maintains-buy-on-arista-networks-price-target-430-93CH-3628796
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:04:15Z
Full Content:
On Monday, Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) with a steady price target of $430.00. The firm is projecting Arista Networks to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, citing increased confidence in their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for these years. The revised EPS estimate for 2024 is now $8.39, up from the previous $8.35 and higher than the FactSet consensus of $8.27. For 2025, the EPS estimate has been set at $9.91, compared to the prior $9.86 and above the consensus of $9.39. The optimism from Goldman Sachs is based on several key factors, including anticipated capital expenditure from Arista's major cloud customers, such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The firm also highlighted the transition from pilot to production in three significant AI cluster projects expected in the next year and the momentum in Ethernet deployments across Arista's target five major AI cluster projects. Additionally, the firm noted Arista's expectations of increased front end networking investment relative to back end spending. Arista Networks' competitive edge is attributed to its top-tier switching platform, which offers scale up and scale out capabilities. This positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly adopting integrated compute systems. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Arista will not only meet its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025 but will also continue to grow beyond that year. Goldman Sachs expects Arista Networks to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. This forecast aligns with the company's history of exceeding the midpoint of its EBIT margin guidance by an average of approximately 260 basis points over the last 26 quarters. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been in the spotlight with significant developments. The company reported a robust Q2 performance, with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta's development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on Arista, projecting a revenue growth target of at least 14% in 2024, while Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. Arista also repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. These recent developments underscore the company's strong market position and potential for continued growth. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. With these developments, Arista Networks continues to make strides in its industry. As Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish stance on Arista Networks, citing robust revenue growth and competitive advantages, InvestingPro data and tips provide additional insights for investors considering ANET stock. The company's strong financial health is reflected in a market capitalization of $121.21 billion and significant revenue growth, with the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 showing a 19.93% increase. This aligns with Goldman Sachs' revenue growth projections for 2024 and 2025. InvestingPro Tips highlight Arista Networks as a prominent player in the Communications Equipment industry with a high return over the last year, suggesting investor confidence in the company's performance and strategy. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, indicating a solid position to meet its financial commitments. However, investors should be aware of the stock trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 48.95, and near its 52-week high, which could imply a premium valuation. For those seeking a deeper dive into Arista Networks' financial health and stock performance, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips to help investors make informed decisions.

Title: Trump Media’s Stock Price Sinks to New Low After Insider Lockup Period Expires

Former president has said he has 'absolutely no intention' of selling his shares in company that operates Truth Social By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company, which operates the unprofitable Truth Social platform, dropped 10.3% Monday to their lowest price since the stock began trading under the ticker symbol “DJT” earlier in 2024. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) stock closed at $12.15/share, down nearly 82% from the company’s peak closing price of $66.22/share on March 27. The slump for the stock comes after a six-month lockup period on shares held by TMTG insiders — including Trump, TMTG’s directors and officers, and certain other securityholders — expired at the end of regular trading Thursday, Sept. 19. Related Stories VIP+ Annapurna-Remedy Deal Is Smart Solution to Gaming’s Funding Woes 'Unstoppable' Director on Working With Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck on the Wrestling Drama and Bringing It to Toronto Amid Their Divorce: 'Everybody's a Professional' Trump has said he has “absolutely no intention of selling” his shares in TMTG. “A lot of people think the reason [the company’s stock price is] down is a lot of people think I’m going to sell, and if I sell, it’s not going to be the same,” Trump said at a Sept. 13 press conference, per CBS News. “But I have absolutely no intention of selling.” Popular on Variety TMTG’s market capitalization currently stands at about $2.4 billion. That’s down from an intraday peak of more than $9.5 billion on March 26, CNBC reported. As of Aug. 15, Trump beneficially owned 56.6% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, making his stake currently worth about $1.4 billion — down from $5.2 billion at stock’s the highest closing price. The 114.75 million shares Trump holds includes 36 million “earnout shares” that TMTG determined he was entitled to in accordance with the merger agreement. TMTG calls Truth Social a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations.” For the second quarter of 2024, TMTG reported $836,900 in net sales and a net loss of $16.37 million, per its 10-Q SEC filing for the period. For Q1, the company reported $770,500 in revenue and a net loss of $327.6 million; most of the loss for the first three months of the year was due to expenses associated with TMTG’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. to become a publicly traded company. According to an Aug. 23 filing with the SEC, TMTG’s board and audit committee authorized a share repurchase of an aggregate of 128,138 shares of the company’s common stock “from certain executive employees” at a prevailing market price of $22.70 per share. As consideration for the repurchase, TMTG said, it will remit $2.9 million plus applicable penalties and interest to the IRS and certain state taxing authorities in connection with the March 7 issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes. “TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump,” the company said in its most recent 10-Q filing. “The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.” The filing also noted that Trump “is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation.” Shares in TMTG began trading on Nasdaq on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol “DJT” following the company’s merger with DWAC. Trump formed TMTG in 2021 after the former president had been kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. Truth Social launched in early 2022. “TMTG was founded to fight back against the big tech companies — Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others — that may curtail debate in America and censor voices that contradict their ‘woke’ ideology,” the company says in its prospectus. TMTG has not disclosed how many people use Truth Social. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” it says in an updated prospectus filed Sept. 5.

Title: Former Merkel rival aims to become chancellor
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2871017/former-merkel-rival-aims-to-become-chancellor
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
Squeezed out of top-level politics by his arch-party rival Angela Merkel more than two decades ago, Friedrich Merz is on course to land his first-ever government job as Germany's next chancellor. The conservative Christian Democrat Party (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, which together are topping nationwide polls, last Tuesday agreed to nominate Mr Merz, 68, as candidate for chancellor in next year's federal election. A wealthy corporate lawyer who took a long hiatus from politics after losing a power struggle within the CDU to Ms Merkel in 2002, Mr Merz is widely considered a polar opposite in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Ms Merkel was a consensus-driven, even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the CDU more towards the centre, Mr Merz is a brash and provocative economic liberal who advocates for a revival of Christian values and has pulled it back to the right since being elected CDU chief almost three years ago. He has been heard railing in recent months against Berlin's handling of migration -- marked by Ms Merkel's own open-door policy -- calling instead for asylum seekers to be turned away at German land borders. A Catholic father-of-three, married to a judge, Mr Merz hopes to win back voters from the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which this month became the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II. In the process, though, he has made a series of populist statements -- such as accusing some Ukrainian refugees of "social welfare tourism" and the children of some Muslim immigrants of being "small pashas" with no respect for authority -- that CDU insiders fear could alienate more centrist voters. The conservative premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Hendrik Wuest, once considered a rival for the chancellor candidacy, earlier this year warned in a newspaper column the CDU should stick to Ms Merkel's "policies of modernity" rather than "scoring cheap points". In what his critics call a sign of his thin skin, Mr Merz, who towers over his opponents at nearly 2 metres tall, made an unusual public dig at Mr Wuest in response. "He is sensitive and quickly vexed, especially when he feels unjustly treated," said Jutta Falke-Ischinger, co-author of an unofficial biography on Mr Merz titled The Unyielding One. "He doesn't have much impulse control." However, Falke-Ischinger said Mr Merz was more decisive than current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is accused of dithering by his opponents. "He [Mr Merz] has an open ear for everything and everyone, is reliable; once he says something, he does it," she said. Mr Merz, a protégé of the late CDU grandee Wolfgang Schaeuble, clinched the job as party chief by dint of persistence and by appealing to grass-roots members frustrated with what they viewed as Ms Merkel's sellout of its core principles, said Alexander Clarkson, a lecturer for German studies at King's College London. "But he does not have much deep support in the party and is one blunder away from coming under enormous internal pressure," he said. The conservatives, which scored their worst-ever result in the 2021 election, have since risen in polls to about 33%, although analysts say that is relatively modest given the unpopularity of Mr Scholz's fractious coalition. Mr Merz, like Mr Scholz, has long languished in politician popularity rankings although his star has risen slightly of late. "He lacks popularity, but maybe you don't need that in these times, but rather you need to show strength -- which he does," said a high-ranking CDU politician, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr Merz, who grew up in a small western town as the eldest son of a judge, was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Ms Merkel in 2002 and left the Bundestag in 2009 in order to pursue a successful business career. The amateur pilot, who disclosed in 2018 that he was earning about €1 million (36.7 million baht) a year, has worked on the advisory and supervisory boards of several major companies, from Commerzbank to BASF. He was also chairman of the German arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager. Critics accuse him of being out of touch with ordinary Germans and prone to representing the interests of corporate elites over the people. His decision to fly a private plane to the wedding of Finance Minister Christian Lindner in 2022 in a country wary of ostentation sparked controversy. Supporters say his private sector experience can help him better understand how to reboot a stagnant economy. Mr Merz, the author of the 2008 book Dare More Capitalism, has said he wants to reduce social benefits and taxes, particularly on companies. He also wants to simplify Germany's notoriously complex tax system; annual tax returns should be so simple you could write them on a beer mat, he once said. The government should create more competitive conditions for all firms for example by lowering energy prices and foster innovation rather than certain sectors like e-mobility, according to Mr Merz, who long opposed Germany's exit from nuclear power. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, said the main problem with the proposals was that Mr Merz had not spelt out how he would finance them. "Merz's economic policy proposals all make sense but are typical opposition proposals and not yet constructive ideas for a next government," he said. Mr Merz's fiscal conservatism, in particular his opposition to common European debt, could also put the brakes on ideas to boost EU growth, for example through higher public investment. Still, Mr Merz, who started his political career as a European lawmaker, has described himself as a "a truly convinced European" and advocated for a closer union, in particular on defence and foreign policy. This and his more hawkish stance on both Russia and China arguably make him more aligned with French President Emmanuel Macron, whom he visited in Paris late last year, than Mr Scholz is, according to Eurasia Group. British World War II leader Winston Churchill is the politician who has marked him most, he says, other than Schaueble. Mr Merz has also described himself as "a convinced transatlanticist", chairing the "Atlantic Bridge", a non-profit fostering US-German ties, for 10 years. His ability to put into place any of his ideas will depend in part on his ability to form a coalition with the very three ruling parties he has now spent years attacking, given he -- like all leaders of mainstream parties -- has ruled out working with the AfD. "As chancellor, he might cater to that growing desire for politicians with clear convictions after the Merkel and Scholz years," said Carsten Nickel at political risk consultancy Teneo. "But German politics is all about compromise in the end, and that might be something that comes less naturally to Merz."

Title: What You Need to Know About Super Micro's 10-for-1 Stock Split

Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month that will take effect after the closing bell on Sept. 30. Here's what you need to know about the split. Shareholders will receive nine new Super Micro shares for every one they already own. Their overall stake in the company won’t change, but the stock will subsequently trade for 10% of its previous price. In other words, if Super Micro shares were trading at $1,000 before the split, an investor holding one share before the split would hold 10 shares priced at $100 each after the split. (Companies can also hold reverse splits, as some have done lately.) Super Micro shares skyrocketed early in 2024 to a high of nearly $1,200 due to surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. They traded closer to $600 when the split was announced, and closed Monday at about $465. The shares have lost more than half their value over the past six months, thanks in part to disappointing recent results. Even so, the stock is still roughly 65% higher year-to-date. The move would be the latest split by a high-flying tech stock, with Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) having already split their shares 10-for-1 this year.

Title: Why Some Analysts Say Qualcomm's Potential Takeover of Intel is 'Impractical'

Time Published: 2024-09-23T20:47:06Z

Intel (INTC) shares have gained ground as investors reacted to a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that said Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a “takeover approach” to the beleaguered chipmaker. However, securities analysts are less keen on the idea, with those at Bank of America calling it “intriguing but perhaps impractical.” A Qualcomm takeover could offer Intel a lifeline for its struggling foundry business, which produces chips for outside customers, the firm noted in a research note released on Saturday. Intel could fill its manufacturing facilities with Qualcomm products, and Qualcomm could become a significant customer for Intel’s silicon wafers. That said, Intel is saddled with more than $50 billion in debt, and Qaulcomm has just $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, making a takeover deal difficult, the BofA analysts said. In addition, the move could “create confusion given potential for headcount and roadmap disruptions,” making such a merger a potential boon for rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). For a Qualcomm-Intel deal to go through, it likely would require a level of buy-in from the U.S. and Chinese governments, analysts at JPMorgan wrote over the weekend. Qualcomm could look for the U.S. government to provide a capital commitment to the foundry business, the success of which is important to domestic semiconductor production. Then there’s regulatory approval from China, which analysts acknowledge would be a major obstacle for such a move. The country "historically has taken years to even consider medium sized transactions," the BofA analysts said. Over the weekend, Apollo Global Management offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. Intel previously agreed to sell Apollo a 49% stake in a chipmaking site in Ireland in June. Shares of Intel gained 3.3% on Monday, while Qualcomm stock was down 1.8%.

Venkata R Madabhushi, the Chief Marketing Officer of Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), has recently engaged in significant trading activity involving the company's stock. According to a recent filing, Madabhushi sold a total of 4,685 shares of Mastercard's Class A Common Stock at an average price of approximately $489.86, resulting in a transaction value of over $2.2 million. The sale took place on September 20, 2024, and was executed in multiple trades with prices ranging from $489.18 to $490.00. The reported average sales price represents a weighted average, reflecting the various prices at which the stock was sold. Following this transaction, Madabhushi's direct ownership in the company decreased to 15,030.79 shares. In a separate transaction on the same day, Madabhushi also exercised options to acquire 2,598 shares of Mastercard stock at a price of $344.48 per share, totaling nearly $895,000. This transaction was carried out under a pre-planned trading plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined plan to buy or sell company stock. The plan was adopted on June 14, 2024, for personal financial management purposes. The filing also disclosed details about Madabhushi's employee stock options. As of the reporting date, he was awarded 8,054 employee stock options on March 1, 2022. Of those, 299 have vested and the remaining 2,685 are set to vest on March 1, 2025. These transactions provide insight into the trading behavior of one of Mastercard's top executives and are disclosed to the public as part of the company's commitment to transparency regarding the ownership and dealings of its insiders. Interested parties can request detailed information on the number of shares sold and the specific prices from the SEC, the issuer, or a security holder of the issuer, as the reporting person has undertaken to provide full information upon request. In other recent news, Mastercard has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share and announced a strategic acquisition of Recorded Future, a global leader in threat intelligence, for $2.65 billion. This acquisition, expected to contribute to Mastercard's revenue growth and diversification of services, has received positive outlooks from analyst firms Baird, BMO Capital Markets, and TD Cowen, while Compass Point has given Mastercard a Neutral rating. Simultaneously, Mastercard has priced new note issuances, including a $750 million note due in 2028 at 4.10%, a $1.15 billion note due in 2032 at 4.35%, and a $1.10 billion note due in 2035 at 4.55%. Baird suggests these issuances will likely have a negligible or neutral effect on the company's earnings per share. In a separate development, Safaricom, Kenya's leading telecommunications company, has partnered with Mastercard to enhance payment acceptance and cross-border remittance services in Kenya. This partnership is expected to leverage Safaricom's M-PESA's extensive merchant network and Mastercard's international payment infrastructure, potentially boosting Kenya’s payment acceptance market growth. The first initiatives of this partnership are expected to be rolled out in the coming months. These are the recent developments in Mastercard's strategic and financial landscape. Amidst the insider trading activity at Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), it's important for investors to consider the broader financial landscape of the company. Mastercard, a prominent player in the Financial Services industry, is not only known for its operational success but also for its consistent shareholder returns. The company has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, showcasing a strong commitment to returning value to its investors. InvestingPro Data reveals that Mastercard boasts a market capitalization of $459.17 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the market. Despite recent insider sales, the company's stock has been trading near its 52-week high, with a price percentage of 99.04% of that peak. This indicates a robust performance in the stock market and investor confidence in the company's prospects. However, it's worth noting that Mastercard is trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 37.85 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 sitting at 36.21. This high valuation could suggest that the stock is priced optimistically relative to its near-term earnings growth. Moreover, the company's Price/Book multiple during the same period is at 61.89, which is considered high and might raise valuation concerns for value-focused investors. For those looking to delve deeper into Mastercard's financial health and future prospects, the InvestingPro platform offers numerous additional tips.

Title: Southwest Airlines Faces a Decisive Fight Over Its Future
URL: https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/southwest-airlines-elliott-investor-day/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T19:26:52Z
Full Content:
Southwest Airlines will host a blockbuster event in Dallas this week, to unveil a service most other carriers began offering decades ago. At its annual Investor Day, Southwest will showcase its first-ever plan for assigning passengers to specific airplane seats, including premium-priced larger ones that will require altering the layouts of the company’s previously egalitarian cabins. Selling a variety of seating options at different price points has long been the practice at Fort Worth–based American Airlines—and at Delta, and United, and most other major carriers around the world. Yet some insiders think Southwest will treat the announcement with the sort of fanfare that accompanied Apple’s introduction of the first iPhone—framing it as a this-changes-everything moment for the company. Even if Southwest CEO Bob Jordan doesn’t don Steve Jobs’s trademark black mock turtleneck, the event will mark a pivotal point in the airline’s 53-year history. That’s because among the shareholders watching carefully will be those at Elliott Investment Management, a so-called activist investment firm led by New York City billionaire Paul Singer. If Elliott doesn’t agree that Thursday’s announcements will deliver a quick enough boost to Southwest’s stock price, it will likely turn up the volume of its calls for heads to roll at the airline—including Jordan’s. That Elliott is in a position to force anyone out of Southwest’s C-suite confirms that things have already changed dramatically at the company. Particularly under its famed cofounder and CEO, the late Herb Kelleher, the airline has fiercely defended its independence, including its maverick business practices, such as open seating. But as the airline has struggled in recent years—not least with hugely disruptive delays and cancellations caused by decades of underinvestment in digital technology—Elliott has gained considerable influence over its future. On June 10, Elliott announced it had acquired a big stake in Southwest, and it now says it holds 11 percent of the airline’s 599 million outstanding shares—enough to call for a special meeting at which it could, with the backing of a majority of other shareholders, force out some or all of Southwest’s board members and, by extension, Jordan. Elliott, which declined to make an executive available to Texas Monthly for an interview, has yet to call for such a meeting. Southwest, whose executives also declined our interview requests, tried to fend off Elliott’s attack earlier this month by offering to have six of its board members resign and to shrink its board from fifteen directors to twelve by next year. During a meeting at Elliott’s offices in New York City, Gary Kelly, Southwest’s executive board chairman and former longtime CEO, also said he’d retire by May. Elliott trumpeted that appeasement offer as unprecedented. But two days after receiving it, the firm’s representatives made clear to leaders of the union that represents the airline’s mechanics that it wasn’t enough. In a subsequent memo to union members, Bret Oestreich, president of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, wrote that Elliott wants Kelly out before next spring. Elliot’s “vision of a Southwest turnaround is one where Robert Jordan does not remain as CEO,” Oestreich added. “If Elliott can assert enough Board influence, other top executives would also, most likely, be replaced.” Jordan has indicated he’s not ready to step down, nor is he inclined to dismiss other executives. Back in August, he wrote to employees that the standoff with Elliott was “a battle for the heart of our company and our future—your future.” The word “heart” was no doubt carefully chosen by a company that once dubbed itself “the love airline,” is headquartered at Love Field, chose LUV for its stock ticker symbol, and paints a giant heart on the belly of each of its planes. On Thursday, Jordan will have the chance to woo Southwest’s other shareholders, the vast majority of which are institutional investors, such as the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. Such investors tend to demonstrate more patience than do “activist” funds such as Elliott, which typically press for actions that would quickly boost the stock price and are often skeptical of executives who wish to make longer-term investments in their businesses. Indeed, one analyst, Sheila Kahyaoglu, a managing director at New York investment bank Jefferies, has said she expects that most Southwest shareholders are unlikely to vote Jordan out without first “entertaining a go-forward plan.” Jordan will have the chance this week to make his case. At Investor Day, he may tout the multiple ways in which he has expensively upgraded the technology Southwest uses to position its planes and flight crews where they’re needed around the country. He could cite his securing of multiple new contracts with all of Southwest’s unionized workers and, now, the addition of premium-seating fees and red-eye flights. Could he add a Steve Jobs–style “one more thing”? Might Southwest end its “bags fly free” policy, since Elliott has called bag fees one of the “key commercial innovations” that Southwest has “written off”? Investors and analysts are eager to find out. Whatever’s in the works, for an airline that has cultivated an irreverent, fun-loving brand reputation, the stakes are seriously high. What would it mean to run Southwest Airlines to Elliott’s liking? The firm offers a snapshot of its vision through a website it created called Stronger Southwest. Solutions include replacing a slew of executives and board directors with outsiders who would turn Southwest into an airline more like American, Delta, and United—with the same checked-bag fees and even more basic economy and premium seating options than Jordan may propose on Thursday. In materials posted to the Stronger Southwest site, Elliott lists multiple executives it might seek to replace. They include Kelly, who has worked for Southwest for 38 years, and Jordan, whose tenure is 36 years, as well as chief financial officer Tammy Romo (33 years) and chief administrative officer Linda Rutherford (32 years). Each of them represents a direct link to airline cofounder Kelleher and former company president Colleen Barrett, who together built Southwest from a tiny Texas-only operation that started flying in 1971 into an airline that today carries more passengers domestically than any other in the U.S. and whose market value was, as recently as 2008, greater than those of the six other major U.S. airlines combined. In past conversations I’ve had with Jordan, Kelly, Romo, Rutherford, and Kelleher (who died in 2019), the long tenure of Southwest’s leadership was considered a strength at the company—cited as key to Southwest’s famously familial corporate culture. Cheryl Hughey, the airline’s senior adviser for culture and engagement, who began working at Southwest in 1980 as a reservation agent, once told me, “It is very important to know your heritage and how the foundation [of the company] was formed. That’s what families do.” Elliot’s Stronger Southwest site doesn’t mention family or corporate culture. But it does quote Kelleher: “If you don’t change, you die. . . . If things change faster outside your company than they change inside your company, you’ve got something to worry about.” That quote, taken from a 2014 conversation between Gary Kelly and Kelleher that’s discussed on Kelly’s own LinkedIn page, must read like nails on a chalkboard to Southwest’s traditionalist insiders. Elliott’s Stronger Southwest site makes no mention of Kelleher’s pronouncements that the airline primarily exists to serve its employees—not its shareholders. Kelleher’s mantra was that if the company takes care of its people, the people will take care of the customers, whose loyal patronage will benefit the shareholders. Elliott might argue, though, that Southwest isn’t caring for its people as well as it once did. Materials on the Stronger Southwest site note a “massive decline in annual profit sharing pay for employees” in recent years. Southwest’s annual profits were 57 percent lower in 2023 than in 2019, even as revenue was 16 percent higher. As a result, the average Southwest employee has seen annual profit sharing decline by more than $9,600 since 2019, according to Elliott. Critics have labeled Elliott a “vulture fund” because of its history of buying distressed bonds of countries on the brink of going broke. Its founder, Singer, famously waged a fourteen-year-long global legal battle to collect on debts owed by the nation of Argentina. The battle nearly erupted in violence when Elliott obtained a court order to seize a three-hundred-foot Argentine naval ship while it was moored off the West African nation of Ghana. Crew members drew their weapons on a man who attempted to board the ship. Calmer heads prevailed, but in the end, Argentina ponied up $2.4 billion to Elliott. The New Yorker reported that that amount represented a 1,270 percent return on Elliott’s initial investment. Elliott isn’t expecting quite so eye-popping a return on its Southwest investment. If the airline is managed as Elliott would prefer, according to Stronger Southwest, its share price should reach $49, although Elliott doesn’t say how quickly that could happen. Such an increase would yield more than $1.2 billion for the firm. If Southwest hopes to keep its adversarial investor from forcing it to become more like American and Delta and United—which, by the way, haven’t exactly delighted investors over the past decade—it might look to its past for guidance. Kelleher once told me, during a conversation in his windowless office at Southwest’s old Love Field headquarters, that he spent years parrying with Wall Street. “I would go to New York in the early eighties,” he said, “and the investment community would tell me that they thought Southwest Airlines was going to have a very short future unless we changed to emulate what the airlines had traditionally done.” Kelleher resisted such calls, and as Southwest continued growing and posted rising profits, eventually Wall Street relented. But that only came after a few tense encounters, including one with an investment banker that I first read about in Thomas Petzinger Jr.’s 1996 book, Hard Landing. During an interview with Kelleher two decades ago, I asked him to confirm that confrontation, which had occurred in the same office where we were sitting. Kelleher, who loved to put on a show, was more than happy to reenact what occurred. He set a Merit Ultra cigarette down in an ashtray and leaped from his blue leather chair, telling me that the banker said Southwest seemed like the perfect target for a hostile takeover. Kelleher wasn’t about to let Southwest get gobbled up by some bigger competitor—be it crosstown rival American Airlines or someone else. In recounting the story, he walked over, put his hands on my shoulders, and showed me how he’d slowly lifted the investment banker out of his seat. At over six feet, Kelleher, a former high school basketball star, could be physically imposing, and his baritone voice could sound downright scary when he got serious, which he had been with the banker. As he backed the man up against a wall and poked him in the chest, “the guy turned white as a sheet,” Kelleher told me. Kelleher explained to the banker that if any company tried to take over Southwest, he would do anything necessary to stop it. “I will even burn this company to the ground if I have to,” he said. The shocked banker ran out the door, passing through the adjoining office of Colleen Barrett (who died earlier this year). Barrett rushed in to ask Kelleher what had happened. He replied: “I just delivered a message to Wall Street.” Up until the COVID-19 pandemic, Wall Street heeded that message. Southwest still boasts a strong claim to being what it calls “the most successful commercial carrier in the history of aviation.” After its founding, the airline posted 47 consecutive years of profits, running from 1973 until COVID wrecked the travel industry, in 2020. Unlike American or Delta or United or most major U.S. carriers, Southwest has never declared bankruptcy. Postpandemic, Southwest, like other airlines, has faced serious operational headwinds. Some of its problems have been worse than those of its peers, such as its holiday season meltdown in 2022. Southwest has remained profitable, but its stock is down about 1 percent since May 2023, while United’s and Delta’s are up about 17 percent and 39 percent, respectively. (American is down 21 percent.) Elliott thinks Southwest can deliver shareholders a big short-term gain by becoming more like its rivals, the very thing Kelleher fought off all those decades ago. At Investor Day, we stand to find out whether the airline will comply or whether it’s about to deliver another defiant message to Wall Street.

Title: Intel needs Qualcomm, but it's not a two-way street, analysts say
URL: https://qz.com/qualcomm-wouldnt-benefit-much-takeover-intel-chips-ai-1851654828
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:42:00Z

After missing second-quarter earnings expectations and seeing its stock fall over 50% so far this year, Intel (INTC) is still attracting interest worth billions of dollars. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is reportedly interested in taking over the chip pioneer in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. And alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has also offered an equity-like investment that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg. By taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America (BAC) Global Research said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world. However, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits, and added they are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Arm. Here are three reasons Bank of America and other analysts say Qualcomm wouldn’t benefit much from an Intel takeover. A deal between a chip designer and a company with the factories to make those chips looks sensible from above, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note — but it doesn’t actually “fit so well.” While Qualcomm uses British chip firm Arm’s architecture for its PC chips, Intel’s x86 processors, which are used in a lot of computer and server hardware, are designed differently. Bank of America analysts also noted the difference, saying Qualcomm’s “existing established relationships” on the Arm architecture make “it tougher to bring product” to Intel’s mostly x86-based fabs. Meanwhile, Windsor said Intel’s x86 processors are “under assault on all fronts from Arm and accelerated computing,” and that Qualcomm has already spent two decades competing against Intel’s chips in the mobile and PC market. “Consequently, it makes no sense to become the owner of a fading titan when one is in a good position to partially or completely displace it from the market,” Windsor said. And Qualcomm already has a relationship with other chipmakers such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung, Windsor said, meaning it already knows “how to design its chips to be optimally manufactured on these processes.” Therefore, having to redesign its chips to be manufactured by Intel, which has already slipped behind with cutting edge chips, “sounds like a risky proposition to me,” he said. If Qualcomm does go through with an acquisition, it would come at a premium to Intel’s current expected value of $87 billion, Bank of America analysts said, adding that Intel also has about $53 billion in debt. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, analysts said. Intel is also planning to spend billions to support a growing fab network, including a five-year, $100 billion expansion plan for plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. While the chipmaker is expecting to receive almost $20 billion in direct federal funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to support the effort, it makes up a small portion of how much the expansion plan is expected to cost. Meanwhile, the chipmaker recently saw its shares close on a high after the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it is eligible for a separate $3 billion in CHIPS Act funding under the Secure Enclave program. Windsor also said in his note that “Qualcomm would almost certainly pay for Intel with shares” which would lead to “dilution for existing holders of Qualcomm’s stock” (which includes Windsor). And while Intel’s shares have fallen this year, Windsor said it’s still “not cheap” due to the chipmaker’s falling revenue. Bank of America analysts said the potential deal faces a “tough regulatory environment, specifically in China,” where medium sized deals have, in the past, “taken years to even consider.” Therefore, analysts said, the potential to dominate the CPU market would actually work against a takeover, because it could face regulatory challenges. For example, the analysts noted Qualcomm’s failed acquisition of Dutch semiconductor company NXP (NXPI) in 2018, after it did not receive approval from China’s antitrust regulator.

European shares closed higher on Monday as a soft business activity reading strengthened the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank this year, with rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities rising. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.4 per cent higher, recouping some losses following its biggest one-day drop since August in the last session. Autos led gains among major Stoxx sectors with a 1.9 per cent advance, while retail also gained 1.2 per cent. A survey showed euro zone business activity contracted sharply and unexpectedly this month as the bloc’s dominant services industry flatlined while a downturn in manufacturing accelerated. “A payback from the Paris Olympics was largely expected. But today’s release was much worse than many had anticipated, suggesting a rather gloomy underlying growth picture for the euro zone,” said Fabio Balboni, senior economist, euro zone at HSBC. Ryanair traded flat on the day despite announcing that it had arranged to fly the Leinster rugby team to its European fixtures this season from Belfast instead of Dublin Airport amid an ongoing farrago over the annual passenger cap at the aviation hub. As expectations of further monetary easing by the European Central Bank increased both AIB and Bank of Ireland lost ground, declining 3.86 per cent and 1.53 per cent respectively. Food giant Kerry traded up 1.85 per cent €90.60 on the back positive sentiment for the sector. Other movers included home-builder Cairn, which fell 1 per cent to €1.89. Germany’s DAX closed 0.7 per cent up while France’s benchmark ended near flat, bogged down by falling bank stocks. French banks including Credit Agricole, SocGen and BNP Paribas were among top declines on the Stoxx index, with the euro zone banks index sliding 1.8 per cent. The euro slipped against the dollar, while the yield on the German two-year bond, which reflects near-term rate expectations, slipped to 2.149 per cent. Rate-sensitive real estate rose 1.3 per cent while utilities, often traded as a bond proxy, gained 1.1 per cent. The ECB cut interest rates in June and also earlier this month. Among individual stock moves, Germany’s Commerzbank slid 5.7 per cent after Berlin said it does not support a takeover by Italy’s UniCredit. UniCredit shares closed 3.3 per cent lower. Aurubis dropped 10.1 per cent after Europe’s largest copper producer guided for lower earnings next financial year as it expects metal prices to fall and after hurdles with a production ramp-up hit its fourth-quarter earnings. UK shares ended higher on Monday after logging their worst day since August in the previous session, boosted by rising commodity-linked shares, while drugmaker AstraZeneca fell following a disappointing experimental precision drug trial. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed 0.4 per cent higher, while the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 midcap index added 0.1 per cent. Precious metal miners led gains among the major FTSE 350 indexes with a more than 2 per cent rise as gold prices scaled record highs, driven by Fed rate cuts and demand for the safe-haven asset on geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Heavyweight energy shares added 0.6 per cent, tracking elevated crude oil prices. Both indexes had notched up their worst day in nearly seven weeks on Friday after the Bank of England held interest rates steady on Thursday, even as the Federal Reserve cut benchmark rates by an outsized 50 basis points. Last week Britain’s consumer price inflation data – which is closely watched by the Bank of England for its monetary policy – pointed to persistent price pressures in the services sector. AstraZeneca slipped 1.7 per cent after the drugmaker said its experimental precision drug did not significantly improve overall survival for patients with a type of breast cancer in a late-stage trial. Wall Street’s main indexes trended higher in choppy trading on Monday as investors focused on comments from Federal Reserve policymakers and steady factory activity data following the central bank’s decision to commence monetary policy easing. The Fed’s pivotal move on monetary policy in the previous week propped up the main indexes for monthly gains, bucking a historical trend where September has been a weak month for equities on average. Comments from a number of policymakers were the main focus on the day as investors scoured for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis points cut. Fed presidents such as Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari and Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Ten out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Real estate stocks lead gains with a 0.9 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.1 per cent. Having rallied for much of the year, the S&P 500 is a whisker away from an all-time high and the blue-chip Dow hit another intraday record high. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.8 per cent, while Meta rose 1 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. – Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia Versus AMD: Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy Right Now?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-vs-amd-which-ai-stock-better-buy-now/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:36:08Z

getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.

Title: Nvidia Versus AMD: Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy Right Now?

getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Title: Feminism, Debt and Organizing Against Argentina’s Far Right
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/feminism-debt-argentina-far-right-milei-organizing
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:27:00Z
Full Content:
BUENOS AIRES — As part of the Ni Una Menos (Not One Less) Collective in Argentina, we have been organizing feminist strikes and actions against the far Right’s austerity plan and its attacks on the rights of women and LGBTQI+ communities. We hope to offer an analysis from a feminist perspective that our movements can apply in the fight against debt under the new, far-right administration of President Javier Milei. Milei assumed office in late 2023 promising deregulation and ​“chainsaw cuts” and quickly began ushering in a slew of austerity measures that have targeted a spectrum of public services, including universities. He also closed Argentina’s anti-discrimination agency and the ministry that handles women’s affairs. We have been developing strategies for collective organizing against debt and the financial colonization of everyday life. This analysis is somewhat novel in Argentina, and we find it fundamental to understanding this moment of Milei’s ascendance. For the first time in our history, the Argentine state spends more on debt payments than pension payments. Under Milei, household debt has also intensified alongside the deregulation of prices for basic goods and services. In researching our book, A Feminist Reading of Debt, we found a large number of women were in debt from purchasing those types of goods and services needed for social reproduction (such as taking care of families and repairing homes, among many others) — a situation exacerbated by Argentina’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018. We call this ​“indebtedness to survive.” Alongside intellectuals like Silvia Federici, we think about the financial colonization of social reproduction as the invasion of finance into increasingly broader areas of life. That’s the context in which we approach the inherent antagonism of the term ​“financial caste.” We use the term in a very precise sense, which must be contrasted with how Milei and his libertarian political force have popularized the use of the word ​“caste.” They use this (and other terms) to present themselves as ​“outsiders,” signaling the political class as the cause of the problems that working people in Argentina face, which excludes the directors of major corporations and financial elites and institutions (banks, the IMF, investment fund managers, businessmen tied to digital finance) that benefit from crises in the Argentine economy. We refuse to let Milei hide his close ties with financial powers and corporations, which he obfuscates by redefining the language of his capitalist conservatism. We are forced to underscore the true meaning of ​“caste” for him and mark a concrete antagonism between the feminist struggle and those who try to profit from financial speculation at the expense of our bodies and spaces. We have outlined some of the lessons we have learned through our processes of resistance to the neoliberal shock policies applied by the extreme right — and we hope they can fuel others in their fights against far-right leaders devoted to corporations and the suppression of women and the working class. 1. For Milei, to govern is to destroy, create chaos and exercise cruelty The two novel characteristics of the neoliberal shockwave we are living through are its speed and violence. Milei derives his power from his links with hedge funds (like BlackRock) and powerful, extractivist corporations and the ultrawealthy (hence his frequent visits with Elon Musk). These deep ties are appearing as Argentine society is being reconfigured by new extremes of capitalism toward an extractive, warlike model. This system of governance is sustained through three vectors: the capacity for destruction (mass firings, elimination of entire state organs, destruction of social ties fostered by community groups); the creation of chaos (neoliberal shock politics and the imposition of new policies and norms, some of them unconstitutional); and the deployment of cruelty (withholding food from the poorest — and taking pride in it). None of it is about excesses or inadequacies but is a form of politics necessary to foster crisis and war. 2. We need to center decolonization There’s not much use arguing whether Milei is a symptom of the local impact of a global phenomenon, or an extreme national idiosyncrasy. So to better understand what is actually happening, we must consider what is new about Milei and to what degree his entrenchment in Argentine politics and society is not particular to national specificities and personal eccentricities. The impact of Milei’s far-right government, for example, exceeds former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s — because the crisis of the genocide in Gaza and the alignment of the United States and Israel have permitted Milei to approach the genocide on his own terms. But Milei too can be differentiated from the exponents of the far right of the Global North, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, because Milei does not operate with nationalism as the engine driving his regime. Instead, Milei’s project is neocolonial, from which he draws his power and effectiveness. As we have previously argued, neoliberalism in our region is inherently violent from its origins. The military dictatorship of 1976 — the moment at which the neoliberal model was applied — cannot be understood separate from the massive repression of popular uprisings. This authoritarianism is not an a posteriori deviation, and in that same way, the violence stemming from neoliberalism in Argentina is tied to processes of recolonization. We are now witnessing a new phase of that recolonization, which can be called ​“financial colonization” (including IMF austerity programs in various countries and the increasing presence of hedge funds targeting natural resources) and ​“military colonization” (as in the case of many Latin American countries, like Ecuador and Haiti, where the possibility of an internal war makes way for colonial domination). There is talk in Argentina of a form of national dissolution that would segment the country into sacrifice zones (with entire provinces linked to the activity of extractivist corporations), so centralizing the need for decolonization (by opposing vocabulary, terminology and practices) becomes a critical tactic. 3. Building power and redefining violence Feminists often think about the intersections of war to identify the emerging coordinates of violence. The war against the conditions of social reproduction (withholding food, liberalization of the prices of fundamental goods and services, freezing salaries) — as well as the war against the conditions for the reproduction of struggle (the economic crisis and debt that makes organizing and demonstrating nearly impossible) — is articulated with war as the global stage, meaning the far right can appeal to residents by polarizing localities that protest. Militarization is the highest stage of financial warfare, which is appearing in Ecuador, Haiti and Argentina (among others) in conditions somewhat similar to circumstances in Africa in the 1980s. Federici, using this perspective, highlights the necessity of generating a feminist antiwar movement to resist this militarization and financial warfare As militant activists and organizers ourselves, we have been obligated to rethink how we categorize and define violence. We have long been saying that violence fueled by toxic masculinity is incomprehensible without being embedded within a system of ​“economic violence,” which has transformed and intensified into ​“financial violence,” which (to invoke Étienne Balibar’s formulation) conforms to capitalism’s aim to become ​“absolute.” 4. Argentina is a laboratory for the rest of the world Milei’s far right is trying to channel a neoliberalism in crisis into relaunching a neo-extractivist project and agenda in the global market, particularly surrounding energy and lithium. One new development is that Milei’s government is not willing to make concessions in the face of increased social conflict. To affirm that Milei’s regime has fascist elements is not to say the majority of his voters are fascists. In fact, a great deal of his support can be explained through everyday economics. It’s a terrain that seems to be disregarded time and again in its inexorable materiality and, as such, in its political rationality. In the feminist movement, we have situated this link between fascism and everyday economics as a fundamental perspective to comprehend the economic violence endured by those who sustain the domestic economy, who go into debt just to survive while hearing from Milei that ​“there is no money” or ​“we’ll need to make sacrifices.” It presents our greatest challenge as anti-debt militants: How do we do politics when the language of austerity becomes the popular language? 5. The streets are a vital space The feminist marches that saw participation from hundreds of thousands of women in cities across Latin America on March 8 (International Women’s Day), including tens of thousands in Buenos Aires, were remarkable for several reasons. We used them against a far-right government that has publicly declared us to be the enemy, has defunded the right to abortion and has campaigned publicly with racist and misogynistic discourse. We organized in spite of the repressive protocol that criminalizes protest, which made self-care essential. And it was all in the midst of Milei’s government waging an economic war against the Argentine population, which makes organizing and mobilizing a huge undertaking. The greatest beneficiary of these neoliberal shock policies is the financial caste. The policies are enacted with the idea that feminized bodies, in ever more precarious conditions, will take on more work to sustain life. We will fight back through feminism of the people.

Title: AI Chip Maker Alphawave Sees Stock Tumble On Revenue Drop

Alphawave Semi was valued at £3 billion ($4 billion) when it debuted on the London Stock Exchange in ... [+] May 2021. Photographer: Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg Alphawave Semi surprised investors this morning when the semiconductor company released interim earnings results that sent its London-traded shares tumbling by as much as 43% before paring the losses to finish the day down by 14%. Alphawave’s leadership said on Monday that it had to cut its revenue forecast for 2024, but still expects to hit its targets from next year onward. The chip designer said it now expects to generate revenue of $310 to $330 million in 2024, down from the $345 to $365 million it had projected earlier. Alphawave blamed the change in its outlook on the merger of two large AI customers in Korea as well as the timing of tape-outs in the second half of the year. Tape-outs occur when Alphawave has completed its work and transfers the finalized design of a semiconductor device to chip foundries for fabrication. The Canadian company does not actually manufacture the chips. Instead, Alphawave focuses on developing the technology within semiconductors that allows them to transmit data more rapidly for use in artificial intelligence. “Another guidance cut isn't helpful but the important part for us, we believe, is the underlying business remains strong and visibility on 2025 is improving, aided by Alphawave being exposed to the best end market in semis–AI,” Barclays analyst Simon Coles said in a note to clients. Barclays maintained an overweight rating on Alphawave’s shares, but lowered its price target to 190 pence from 195. The company’s shares closed Monday at 107.8 pence. “Our OW [overweight] is predicated on the fact that Alphawave only needs to take a little market share to see material growth in the coming years given the growth expected in its end markets,” Coles added. Alphawave’s filing on Monday showed that its revenue had been halved in the first half of the year to $91 million. The company also reported an adjusted net loss before depreciation, interest and taxes of $11.8 million, after booking a profit of $32.4 million in the same period last year. “We expect revenue and adjusted Ebitda in the second half to increase significantly over the first half as our high-quality design wins from last year tape-out and convert into revenue,” John Lofton Holt, executive chairman of Alphawave, said in its filing. Alphawave first debuted on the London Stock Exchange in May 2021 with a listing price of 410 pence and the backing of blue-chip asset managers BlackRock and Janus Henderson. In late 2021, the Financial Times raised questions over whether it had properly disclosed related-party transactions. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

September 23, 2024 14:00 ET | Source: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

September 23, 2024 13:57 ET | Source: Force For Good Force For Good LONDON, Sept. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Force For Good: The world is failing to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and urgent action is needed to unlock progress and overcome the growing annual SDG funding gap, which now stands at US$14-17 trillion, a new report from Force for Good finds, US$112-136 trillion in total, up 10%, due to the costs of global climate transition and development needs in the Global South. Today, only 16% of the goal’s 169 underlying targets are on track to be met by 2030, with 50% falling behind, and 30% regressing below their 2015 levels when the SDGs were kicked off, the report finds. Nine ‘Big Ideas’, including climate transition frameworks, AI-enabled connectivity, and universal digital financial services, if scaled globally, have the cumulative potential to progress SDG achievement to nearly 90%, from less than 66% today, reigniting exponential progress. “This report shows how the global order and the systems itself can be transformed by delivering solutions en masse across the planet, engaging everyone in this endeavour ... By leveraging the strengths of governments, private companies, NGOS and mobilising the individual as an agent of change, we can create a sustainable, secure, and prosperous future,” said Ketan Patel, Chair of the Advisory Council. The world’s failure to meet the goals is being driven by a series of interrelated economic, political, geopolitical and environmental shocks - including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and Gaza, the energy, cost-of-living and climate crises – interacting with one another to create a ‘polycrisis’ that is diverting attention and resources away from sustainable development. A mass and fast roll out of the ‘Nine Big Ideas’, sponsored by appropriate champions across government, private sector or multi-lateral institutions, working with the United Nations, can make a transformative impact on developing countries, while benefitting the global economy. While the mass mobilisation of solutions will take a global effort, the largest developing countries, particularly India, China, and Brazil, account for two-thirds of the world’s sustainable development potential. These countries represent the first wave of opportunity in a multi-wave project to realize the future faster. Meeting the SDGs is a crucial step for the world in the transition to the next era of human civilization, building a platform on which further breakthroughs and technologies can create a sustainable, secure and superior future. About Force for Good Force for Good's mission is to mobilize capital, resources, and ideas as a force for good in the world at a time of profound change.

Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Monday, a day before a Senate hearing on the costs of the company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify Tuesday from the company’s home in Denmark before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The committee accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. The committee said Americans with Type 2 diabetes pay $969 a month for Ozempic, compared to $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and $59 in Germany. It added that Americans are charged $1,349 a month for Wegovy, more than the $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. In an interview with NBC News last month, Jorgensen defended the company’s pricing, saying that insurance coverage varies from country to country, and that most Americans with health insurance pay $25 a month for Wegovy. Novo Nordisk shares were down 3.3% at $123.55 in intraday trading Monday, extending Friday's losses after the company reported disappointing results from a study of an experimental weight-loss treatment. Still, they are up about 19% from the start of the year. TradingView

Title: Italy approves BlackRock holding more than 3% in Leonardo

ROME (Reuters) -Italy has approved BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, holding a stake of more than 3% in Italian defence and aerospace group Leonardo, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday. The document, sent by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office to parliament, deals with so-called "golden power" decisions. Rome has "golden powers" to block or set conditions on foreign and domestic investments, as well as governance changes, involving companies that operate in strategic sectors such as energy, telecoms, defence and banking. "I am happy for the interest of BlackRock. It is an important recognition," Leonardo chief executive Roberto Cingolani told Reuters. The cabinet granted the authorisation to BlackRock on Sept. 18 while also imposing some unspecified conditions, according to the document. Under Italian legislation, Meloni's office must approve share ownership in any strategic firm which is also listed on the Milan stock exchange when the stake crosses thresholds set at 3%, 5%, 10%, and various other intervals up to 50%. However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters BlackRock was expected to trim its stake in a short time, as Leonardo's bylaws stipulate that no investor outside the public administration can own more than 3% of capital. Italy's economy ministry owns 30.2% of Leonardo, the country's leading defence group as well as a manufacturer of satellites and orbiting infrastructure. BlackRock is also a leading investor in Italy's financial sector, holding 7% of UniCredit and 5% of Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), the country's top two banks.

Title: Danish PM shrugs off risks of Ozempic maker’s economic dominance
URL: https://qz.com/denmark-novo-nordisk-nokia-1851654843
Time Published: 2024-09-23T16:29:00Z
Full Content:
Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed concerns that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Scandinavian nation’s largest corporation, could someday drag down its economy the way the once-dominant Nokia (NOK) did to Finland in the 2000s. With a market value of $570 billion, Novo Nordisk has surpassed Denmark’s annual GDP. However, Frederiksen told Bloomberg on Monday that she didn’t see any risk associated with the size of Novo Nordisk. “I am extremely proud that we have big, now global, companies coming from Denmark. I don’t see a lot of risks with even the size of some of the companies, because we have a very strong economy also in other sectors,” Frederiksen said. “But we have of course to watch it.” Unrelenting demand for Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year. The Danish pharma giant helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to do so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, forecast earlier this year that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, due primarily to Novo Nordisk. In 2023, Denmark’s GDP grew 1.8% — and much of its boost is owed to the pharmaceutical industry. Without pharmaceuticals, the agency says, the country’s GDP would have instead fallen 0.1%. Leading that growth is Novo Nordisk, with analysts expecting continued sales increases. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate that the global market for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic will reach $105 billion by 2030. The company reported in January that its 2023 sales jumped 31% to 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.8 billion), compared with 177 billion Danish kroner ($25 billion) in 2022. It also projects sales will increase by up to 22% to 28% in 2024. The situation is beginning to resemble Finland’s past reliance on Nokia, the once-dominant telecommunications company. According to estimates from the Finnish Economic Research Institute, Nokia accounted for 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. But when rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Samsung in the smartphone market led to Nokia’s rapid decline in the early 2010s, Finland faced significant economic challenges. This downturn, combined with the effects of the Great Recession, resulted in widespread job losses and ushered in over a decade of economic difficulties for the country. Addressing concerns that Denmark could face similar challenges with its reliance on Novo Nordisk, Frederiksen emphasized the country’s economic diversity. “A good thing is that our export portfolio is spread across several areas that are less sensitive to the business cycle than in other places,” she said. Denmark is also home to other major companies like Carlsberg, AP Moller-Maersk (AMKBY), Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY), and Lego.

Shares of Newmont (NEM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), and other gold miners advanced as the price of the precious metal hit a record high. General Motors (GM) shares declined after Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mary Barra reiterated that the automaker would make only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 even as EV demand slows. Shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped when TD Cowen downgraded the stock, citing lower demand and increasing competition. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Novo Nordisk (NVO) slipped ahead of tomorrow's Senate hearing on the drug maker's pricing of its wildly popular Wegovy and Ozempic weight-loss treatments.

The pension giant also committed another $1 billion to a BlackRock climate fund after dumping nearly $4 billion in public equities earlier this year. The New York State Common Retirement Fund cashed out of three multi-asset strategic partnerships worth more than $3 billion during July, according to its latest monthly transaction report. The $268 billion pension fund also committed $1 billion to a BlackRock climate change fund, marking the second straight month it invested in public equities after terminating a combined $3.8 billion worth of equity funds in March and April. The NYSCRF ended a Schroder Investment Management multi-asset fund within its multi-asset strategic partnership portfolio that was worth approximately $1.2 billion, which was allocated to cash. It also terminated multi-asset funds managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Wellington Management, respectively, which were worth $1.1 billion each and were also allocated to cash. Within its public equities portfolio, the pension fund doubled its investment in BlackRock’s MSCI Climate Change Index to $2 billion. The commitment follows an initial $1 billion investment in January 2023. The fund tracks an index that measures opportunities and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. It was up 31% in 2023 and 15% annually over five years.

Title: Qualcomm has good reasons to bid for Intel — but a takeover probably won't happen
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-challenges-qualcomm-pros-cons-takeover-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-23T15:32:56Z

If Qualcomm sees it through, its takeover of Intel would likely be the biggest in Silicon Valley history. While it has good reasons to go after the storied chip giant, a lot is working against it. The possibility of Intel handing its 56-year history over to a younger rival emerged last week after several reports said that the California semiconductor firm Qualcomm had approached it for a takeover. Qualcomm is no newbie in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1985, 39 years ago. Since then, it has grown into a company worth over $188 billion, specializing in areas such as wireless networks, smartphone processors, and modems. But recent trouble brewing at Intel, a longtime chip designer and manufacturer, has apparently given Qualcomm reason to consider acquiring a company that has lost more than half its value this year and dropped to a market capitalization of just over $93 billion. While some of its top competitors, like Nvidia, have soared to new heights as a result of the generative-AI boom, Intel has struggled to capitalize on investor interest in the technology. It has also grappled with production and strategy challenges. The company took a serious tumble in August — a month in which it lost almost $30 billion in market value — after announcing the layoffs of 15,000 employees and a suspension of its dividend from the fourth quarter of this year. It's worth noting that Qualcomm's talks to take over this troubled business are very early stage and exploratory. A person close to Qualcomm told the Financial Times that the company "would only pursue a friendly deal." For some, the logic to pursue the deal is apparent. Speaking on CNBC last week, Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst, said Intel's exposure to key areas like data centers and the PC market, as well as its chip-manufacturing capabilities — which Qualcomm lacks as it outsources that process to Taiwan's TSMC — meant there were "synergies in this." The company has also taken steps that seem to make it a more attractive purchase. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a set of drastic measures last week to bring change to the company that could set it on a brighter path. He said these included a "multi-year, multi-billion-dollar" deal to work on custom chip designs with the tech heavyweight Amazon Web Services, a pause on plans to build plants in Europe, and the separation of its manufacturing unit, Intel Foundry, into its own entity. That said, not everyone is convinced that Qualcomm needs Intel — or that a buyout would be a good idea for either company. Richard Windsor, an equity-research analyst and the founder of Radio Free Mobile, thinks that while "it is possible to see how Qualcomm and Intel could fit together" — one company designs chips and the other has factories — a lot of Intel's bits wouldn't fit so well. "The vultures are hovering around Intel and while Intel will make a tasty and nutritious meal for some, I think Intel would end up sticking in Qualcomm's crop and give it a bad case of indigestion," he wrote in a note on Monday. He points to a few key reasons. Intel's x86 processors lag behind Qualcomm's and its rival firm Arm's offerings. Redesigning chips to be made by Intel "sounds like a risky proposition," he said, given Qualcomm's "already established excellent relationships" with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan market analyst at the financial-services firm TF International Securities, went a step further, saying in a post over the weekend that a takeover of Intel could be "disastrous" for Qualcomm. My industry survey also indicates that Qualcomm is currently in takeover talks with Intel. However, if this acquisition were to go through, it could prove disastrous for Qualcommhttps://t.co/fJ7EozISve His rationale was that Qualcomm's "most critical focus should be on establishing competitiveness in AI chips" for segments like smartphones and that he didn't see an acquisition of Intel helping. It could boost its position in the market for artificial-intelligence PCs, but the analyst said he thought Qualcomm already had a strong standing in that area, with its processors used in Microsoft's Windows on Arm platform — a version of Windows running on Arm technology that Microsoft is committed to. "While the acquisition of Intel could rapidly increase Qualcomm's PC market share, it comes at a significant cost," he wrote. "Qualcomm can grow in the AI PC market even without the acquisition." It's also unclear how Qualcomm would find the cash to buy Intel. The company's cash on hand is $13 billion, but even with its free cash flow, it still falls far short of Intel's price. And the impact on competition would likely spark alarm among regulators. A Qualcomm bid for Intel could face similar regulatory obstacles to Nvidia's takeover attempt for Arm in 2020, which it abandoned in 2022. Intel will, of course, want to consider its options. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that a new option was on the table after the investment giant Apollo offered to make a "multibillion-dollar investment" in the company. That could offer the chip firm vital capital for its new plans and help it stand on its own two feet. Jump to

Alaska Airlines (ALK) said an IT issue was behind an issue with its system that caused flights to be delayed and a ground stop to be issued in Seattle Sunday night. The airline said the issue was resolved around 1 a.m. ET Monday, and told users flight operations and the airline's website should be back to normal. A total of 249 flights from Alaska Airlines were delayed Sunday, about 30% of their total schedule, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. "Last night, we experienced an IT issue that caused significant disruption to our operation—including delayed flights," the airline said in a statement. "The issue has been resolved, but we expect residual impacts to our operation. We sincerely apologize to our guests who are impacted and are working to get all our guests to their destinations." The company also told Reuters that the incident was not the result of a hack or any malicious activity. Earlier this month, the airline lifted its revenue and profit projections for the current quarter, in part thanks to the struggles of competing airlines during this summer's CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage that delayed or canceled thousands of flights. Alaska Air Group shares were up 2.5% to $41 in early trading Monday and have gained close to 5% since the start of the year.

Time Published: 2024-09-23T15:02:54Z
Full Content:
Investors following the movements of Saba Capital Management, L.P. may be interested to learn that the firm has recently made a significant purchase of shares in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ). The transaction, which took place on September 19, involved the acquisition of 15,455 shares at a price of $16.14 each, amounting to a total investment of $249,443. This purchase is notable as it increases Saba Capital Management's holdings in the company to a total of 20,601,568 shares. The investment decision reflects Saba Capital's continued interest in the health sciences sector and its confidence in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust's performance. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is known for its focus on the health sciences industry, which includes sectors like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. The trust's investment strategy and portfolio composition make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify into this segment of the market. As a prominent investment firm, Saba Capital Management's market activities are closely watched by investors and analysts alike. The firm's latest move could signal a positive outlook for BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, potentially influencing other investors' perceptions of the trust's value and prospects. The investment details were disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides transparency into the trading activities of the firm's executives and significant shareholders. These filings are a valuable resource for investors looking to understand the investment patterns and strategies of major players in the financial markets. For those interested in tracking the performance of BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, the stock trades under the ticker symbol NYSE:BMEZ. As always, investors are encouraged to consider the broader market context and perform their own due diligence before making investment decisions. As Saba Capital Management increases its stake in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ), investors are evaluating the trust's recent performance and financial metrics. According to InvestingPro data, BMEZ boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.31, reflecting the market's valuation of the company relative to its earnings. One of the standout InvestingPro Tips for BMEZ is its significant dividend yield, which currently stands at an impressive 13.19%, as of the last dividend with an ex-date of September 16, 2024. This yield is particularly attractive to income-focused investors who are looking for steady cash flows from their investments. In contrast, a point of concern may be the weak gross profit margins, which could indicate challenges in maintaining profitability relative to sales. Additionally, the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield, suggesting that the price investors are willing to pay for each dollar of free cash flows is relatively high. Despite these concerns, BMEZ has been trading near its 52-week high, with the price being 96.26% of the peak, indicating strong investor confidence and a potentially bullish outlook among market participants. The trust has also experienced positive total returns across various time frames, with a year-to-date price total return of 17.71% and a one-year price total return of 24.4%. For those considering an investment in BMEZ, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering deeper insights into the trust's financial health and market performance.

The HKMA has engaged 11 firms for advanced e-HKD+ digital currency trials, so far. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has announced the launch of the second phase of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program, known as e-HKD, according to a Sept. 23 statement. The second phase will delve into advanced use cases for digital money, emphasizing e-HKD and tokenized deposits for individuals and businesses. The first phase focused on testing CBDC applications in domestic retail payments, offline transactions, and the settlement of tokenized assets. The HKMA stated that the initiative has evolved from its original e-HKD focus and is now rebranded as Project e-HKD+ to align with the changing fintech landscape. The HKMA has engaged 11 firms from various sectors to investigate e-HKD applications in three main areas, including tokenized asset settlement, programmability, and offline payments. Some of the participants reportedly involved in phase 2 include ANZ, Airstar Bank, Aptos Labs, BlackRock, Bank of Communications (Hong Kong), ChinaAMC, China Mobile, DBS, Fidelity International, Kasikornbank, and Sanfield. The HKMA stated that these firms will evaluate the commercial viability of new digital money forms within real-world settings, aiming to enhance accessibility for individuals and corporations. The results of Phase 2 will provide insights into the practical challenges of creating a digital money ecosystem that integrates both publicly and privately issued digital currencies. Project e-HKD+ will further develop the necessary technology and legal framework to support potential future issuance of e-HKD for both individuals and businesses. To foster collaboration, the HKMA will establish the e-HKD Industry Forum. This platform will enable participating institutions to discuss common challenges and explore the scalable implementation of new digital money forms. Industry-led working groups will address specific topics, initially focusing on programmability. Similar to Phase 1, an e-HKD sandbox will be available for pilot participants to facilitate prototyping, development, and testing of use cases. During Phase 2, the HKMA will collaborate closely with the selected firms over the next 12 months to share key findings with the public by the end of next year. HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue stated: “Project e-HKD+ signifies the HKMA’s commitment to digital money innovation. The e-HKD Pilot Programme has provided a valuable opportunity for the HKMA to explore with the industry how new forms of digital money can add unique value to the general public. The HKMA will continue to adopt a use-case driven approach in its exploration of digital money.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Northvolt to axe 1,600 jobs as Europe's EV hopes stall
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/northvolt-to-axe-1600-jobs-as-europes-ev-hopes-stall-3627890
Time Published: 2024-09-23T14:45:47Z
Full Content:
By Marie Mannes STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt plans to cut 1,600 jobs at its base in Sweden, or about a fifth of its global workforce, as Europe's biggest hope in the electric vehicle battery market struggles with production problems, sluggish demand and competition from China. The leader in efforts to build a European automotive battery industry said on Monday it would suspend plans for a large expansion of its Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, northern Sweden. In an effort to cut costs, Northvolt slimmed down its business earlier this month, departing from its original mission to be an all-in-one shop offering everything from material production and battery making to end-of-life recycling. With Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) among its owners, Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent's automakers as they switch from internal combustion engines to EVs. But the Swedish company has struggled with order delays. Problems scaling up production led BMW (ETR:BMWG) to pull a $2 billion order in June. Northvolt said on Monday it would focus on ramping up the first 16 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual battery cell production capacity at Northvolt Ett, while shelving a construction project that had aimed at increasing its capacity by another 30 GWh. Currently, the company produces less than 1 GWh and originally planned for the factory to ultimately make batteries for over one million cars a year, at 60 GWh of capacity. Growth in EV demand is also slower than some in the industry projected, and competition is stiff from China, which accounts for 85% of global battery cell production, International Energy Agency data shows. "We are determined to overcome the challenges we face, and to emerge stronger and leaner," Northvolt co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson said in a statement. "We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business." The company's R&D hub, Northvolt labs, will slow all programmes and expansion, while maintaining the fundamental platforms, it said. It did not mention the fate of planned gigafactories in Germany and Canada, which are at risk of being postponed. EUROPEAN PROSPERITY Northvolt's "level of ambition and their level of realism at the moment is fairly good in that they're not pushing blindly ahead when it's not working," said Evan Hartley, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Northvolt is still loss-making despite securing orders worth over $50 billion from customers including top investor Volkswagen, underscoring Europe's struggle to compete with the dominance of Chinese battery makers such as CATL and BYD (SZ:002594). The Swedish firm has organised $15 billion in equity and debt financing from a raft of players including Goldman Sachs - its second-biggest investor - and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to filings, and has been trying to raise more to fund its ramp-up. It lost $1.2 billion last year, up from a $285 million loss the year before. Its cash on hand at the end of 2023 was $2.13 billion. Former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi warned this month that Europe needed a far more coordinated industrial policy and massive investment to keep pace economically with the United States and China. But many European governments are financially stretched following the COVID pandemic and grappling with anaemic growth. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sept. 13 that while he wanted companies engaged in green technologies to thrive, the government would not take a stake in Northvolt. The government has also said it will not lend to the company. Carlsson said all interested parties should work with the company. "I believe it's important going forward that all the stakeholders we work with now - customers, shareholders, lenders, and also national stakeholders - are contributing to a good long-term solution, because this is about European prosperity and competitiveness," he told Swedish radio.

Title: Microsoft shares downgraded to neutral with no change in price target
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/microsoft-shares-downgraded-to-neutral-with-no-change-in-price-target-93CH-3628066
Time Published: 2024-09-23T14:26:16Z
Full Content:
DA Davidson has revised its rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), transitioning from a "Buy" to a "Neutral" stance, while keeping the price target unchanged at $475.00. The adjustment comes amidst observations that competitors have caught up with Microsoft in the AI segment, which has been a significant factor in the company's previously high valuation. According to DA Davidson, the competitive landscape in AI technology has evolved to a point where Microsoft's leading edge has diminished. This change has led to a reassessment of the tech giant's stock, resulting in a downgrade. Despite this, the firm has decided to maintain the existing price target for Microsoft's shares. The firm's analysis places Microsoft at the fourth position within the Mag6 ranking, a leaderboard of major tech companies that includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with Microsoft now trailing behind Amazon, Meta, and Apple. The Mag6 is often used as a benchmark to gauge the performance and valuation of leading tech companies. Microsoft's stock performance has been notably robust, with an increase of 92% since DA Davidson initiated coverage in January 2023. This growth outpaced the S&P 500's rise of 49% during the same period, highlighting Microsoft's strong market performance relative to the broader index. In other recent news, Constellation Energy and Microsoft have joined forces to restart a unit of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. This initiative is in response to the growing demand for electricity by tech companies, particularly for data centers that support advanced technologies. The revival will focus on Unit 1 of the facility, with an investment of approximately $1.6 billion and an expected operational date by 2028. Microsoft has agreed to purchase energy from the reactivated plant for a period of 20 years. Meanwhile, Google has made a significant move into the carbon offset market by purchasing 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This agreement represents Google's first venture into Brazilian carbon projects and is part of a larger commitment to achieve these credits by 2030. In a recent development, Mizuho reaffirmed its positive outlook on Microsoft shares, maintaining an Outperform rating following the announcement of a new $60 billion share repurchase program and a nearly 11% increase in its quarterly dividend. These financial strategies signal Microsoft's ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders and confidence in its future performance. Similarly, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., the parent company of Facebook, has entered into an agreement with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm to acquire up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits. This deal extends through 2038 and is part of Meta’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. The credits originate from BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group's forest restoration efforts in Latin America. As Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) faces a shifting competitive landscape in AI technology, it's essential to consider various financial metrics that offer a broader understanding of the company's current market position. With a market capitalization of $2.4 trillion, Microsoft stands as a colossal player in the tech industry. The company's P/E ratio, a measure of its current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is 36.79, indicating a high valuation in the market. This is further emphasized by its P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, which is slightly lower at 36.61. Microsoft's revenue growth remains solid, with a 15.67% increase over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, showcasing the company's ability to expand its sales. Additionally, the firm's gross profit margin of 69.76% during the same period reflects its efficiency in controlling the costs associated with its goods and services. From an investment standpoint, two InvestingPro Tips highlight Microsoft's financial stability and market presence. The company has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, Microsoft is recognized as a prominent player in the software industry, which aligns with its historical performance and the maintained price target by DA Davidson despite the downgrade to a "Neutral" stance. For investors looking for more in-depth analysis and additional tips, InvestingPro offers a total of 15 InvestingPro Tips for Microsoft, which can be accessed through the platform to aid in making informed investment decisions.

Title: Bitcoin leads $321 million inflows into crypto as Fed rate cuts spur growth

Ethereum outflows contrast broader market rebound following dovish Fed stance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the second consecutive week this month, with investors pouring $321 million into the industry, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This influx boosted the total assets under management (AuM) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) by 9%, bringing the total to $85.8 billion. The overall investment product volume also increased to approximately $9.5 billion. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, linked this positive trend to the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He explained: “This surge was likely driven by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) comments last Wednesday, which took a more dovish stance than anticipated, including a 50 basis point interest rate cut.” A breakdown of the flows showed that Bitcoin-based investment products led the inflows, generating $284 million in net gains globally last week. Notably, major crypto funds from firms like BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, ProShares, and 21Shares contributed to this rebound, collectively adding $321 million in net inflows. The positive price momentum for Bitcoin also attracted investors with bearish sentiment, who allocated $5.1 million to short-Bitcoin funds. Ethereum faced its fifth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $29 million. This trend stems from ongoing withdrawals from Grayscale’s ETHE product and declining interest in new offerings. According to Farside data, ETHE experienced outflows between $13 million and $18 million for three straight days last week, overshadowing minor inflows from other products, including Grayscale’s Mini-Trust. Meanwhile, Solana maintained its current positive trend, adding $3.2 million in inflows last week. This flow can also be linked to the announcements of several traditional financial institutions announcing plans to launch financial services on the network during the latest Solana Breakpoint event in Singapore.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new chip-making factories in the United Arab Emirates amid surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." Among the hurdles on the technical side: The need for "super-clean water" to rinse silicon wafers—an issue when most of the UAE's water is produced via desalination—and "concerns about the availability of engineering talent to staff major new factories far from the companies' home bases." The report also said that the two companies have had talks with U.S. officials worried that the advanced AI chips produced would make their way to China, a key trading partner of the UAE. Government subsidies globally have been helping the chip industry expand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In the U.S., the government has been doling out billions in grants as part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to ensure production is done domestically. TSMC's American depositary receipts (ADRs), which edged higher as markets opened Monday, are up almost 70% this year.

The company's revenue growth over the last twelve months up to Q3 2024 has been remarkable, at 32.04%, indicating a strong upward trajectory in its financial performance. Furthermore, the company's P/E ratio, though high at 151.43, may reflect market expectations of future earnings growth, supported by a substantial gross profit margin of 74.71% during the same period. Investors looking for stability in returns may find comfort in Broadcom's consistent dividend payments, which have been maintained for 15 consecutive years. The dividend yield as of late 2024 stands at 1.24%, with a notable dividend growth of 15.22% over the last twelve months.

Title: What Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Really?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2024/09/23/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-really/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg You probably hear about the Dow Jones Industrial Average every day, but how much do you really know about it? Q. What is the Dow Jones Industrial Average anyway? A. It’s a venerable U.S. stock-market index, that Charles Dow invented in 1896. It comprises 30 stocks, which the selection committee at Dow Jones & Co. (now part of News Corp.) considers to be leaders in their industries. Q. Was it always 30 stocks? A. When Charles Dow invented the index, it contained only 12 stocks. Some of the original stocks were American Cotton Oil Co., American Sugar Refining Co., Chicago Gas Co., National Lead Co. and United States Leather Co. Many of the original 12 merged into other companies and none of them are still in the index. Q. Are the stocks equal-weighted in the index? A. Not at all. They are weighted according to each stock’s price. That’s because the index was created before there were computers. Charles Dow added up the 12 prices and divided by 12. As a result of this quaint weighting system, Goldman Sachs (GS), with a stock price of $498.93 as of September 21, has about ten times the weight of Verizon (VZ), with a stock price of $44.33. Unscientific? You bet. Most modern stocks indices, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, are weighted according to each stock’s market value. Q. Then why do people still pay attention to the Dow industrials? A. Professionals mostly use the S&P 500. But the Dow carries an aura of familiarity, history and tradition. Also, it’s nice to be able to research stocks (even if in a crude fashion) before 1923 when Standard & Poor’s started to publish an index. Q. What’s the highest weighted stock in the Dow? A. At the moment, it is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), with a stock price of $575, giving it an 8.9% weight in the average. Q. What’s the most lightly weighted stock? A. Intel Corp. (INTC), priced at $21.84, for a 0.34% weight. Q. What’s your favorite stock among the 30? A. I think highly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. (JPM). The nation’s largest bank, headed by the capable and charismatic Jamie Dimon, should benefit as the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates. Q. What’s your least favorite? A. Probably Boeing Co. (BA). The strike by its machinists will get resolved, but I’m more worried about the long-term fallout from the company’s recent safety failures (most notably, a fuselage panel falling off in flight). To shore up quality and prevent future accidents, I believe Boeing will have to slow production. It will also be burdened with more federal regulatory oversight. Q. Is the word “industrial” in the index’s title misleading? A. A bit. For Dow index purposes, if a stock isn’t a utility or transportation stock, it’s an industrial. Q. What is Dow Theory? A. The theory postulates that a market advance is sustainable if, and only if, the Dow Jones transportation average (which Charles Dow invented in 1884) “confirms” a rise in the Dow Industrials. I’m a bit skeptical of the theory. Services are now a big part of the economy, reducing the importance of transportation. Q. How often do the components of the industrial average change? A. In 130 years, the Dow Jones selection committee has changed the components of the average 58 times. In most cases, more than one stock was replaced. Thus, the average has 30 current members and (if my count is correct) 111 former members. Q. What are the most recent changes? A. This year, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) was added and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) was dropped. In 2020, the selection committee added Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Salesforce Inc. (CRM) to the average, eliminating Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). Q. Do stocks dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average usually flop? A. Not at all. In fact, during the past 25 years, stocks kicked out of the average has outperformed their replacements. General Electric Co., which was one of the index’s original members, has revived its fortunes (and split into three successor companies) since it was booted in June 2018. GE was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, which has fallen 84% in the past five years and was itself kicked out in February 2024. Disclosure: Personally and for clients, I own shares in Pfizer. Some of my clients own Exxon Mobil, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. A hedge fund I run has call options on Intel, RTX and Walgreens, and put options on Boeing. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Fractional Consultancy Launches to Accelerate Sustainability Efforts

ADWEEK House is your house during advertising's big week in NYC. Join us for content, to take a beat, recharge and make industry connections. RSVP to join us October 8-9 in New York City. Plenty of agencies claim some form of sustainability offerings for clients, but few make it their main focus. As Climate Week NYC gathers global leaders to find ways to tackle climate change, Chiefly & Co., a women-led fractional executive consultancy, is launching to help companies prove that being sustainable is not just the right thing to do, but it’s also good for the bottom line. Chiefly & Co. has created a unique model that combines fractional domain expertise with a commitment to sustainable practices. The consultancy looks to become a go-to partner for companies and organizations that have a desire to accelerate their sustainability efforts while still driving for business success. Founder Melanie Mercier, after stints at BlackRock, Gap, and as a consultant and experiential marketer, decided to get her executive MBA at Tulane University a few years ago. There, she read case studies about organizations like Unilever, which transformed its business through sustainability efforts that led to profitability and success. She also realized the negative impact the experiential and events industry had on the planet and wanted to do something about it. “Sustainability is a business imperative, and it’s not just in one sector, it’s across all business sectors, Mercier told ADWEEK. Mercier cited studies by Morgan Stanley, Accenture, and others showing that sustainability is the new key driver to innovation, value creation, and cost savings and profitability. “There is a misconception out there that sustainability and profitability don’t coexist, when actually they do and they should. We’re helping to shed light on that and bring that to the forefront of businesses,” she added. Debuting during Climate Week NYC—where Mercier will be on hand with a few of the fractional executives on her roster—underscores Chiefly & Co’s commitment to helping businesses take meaningful action on sustainability. The consultancy’s approach leverages the power of top-tier fractional leaders and provides companies with expert guidance to navigate sustainability issues and profits, especially since many companies don’t have that type of leadership and domain expertise internally. Chiefly & Co’s C-suite leaders will ensure success for clients by looking across the organization to break down silos, build consensus, and embed sustainability throughout organization. “No matter where sustainability originates, whether it’s through the marketing function or just coming from the CEO as a mandate, we make sure it is embedded into the fabric of the organization,” said Mercier. Every organization gets tailored strategies from Chiefly & Co. based on the needs and budget, but the company works from frameworks that are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also will follow all compliance and reporting guidelines. “It’s really looking at how organizations can innovate, create value, and build strategies, but making sure they’re aligned with the SDGs so companies are on target to hit net zero by 2050, if not sooner, and lowering carbon emissions,” said Mercier. “We’re positioning Chiefly & Co, and our fractional experts, as the planet profit pros.” Taking a fractional executive approach is another step towards sustainability, as the client can scale up or down based on needs. Fractional talent and agencies are a growing trend in the marketing world. While one might call it freelance work, being a fractional C-suite member offers former agency and business executives the freedom to work on high-level projects without being tied to one client or agency. “Fractional is the new modern, sustainable leadership solution and that is the benefit that we bring to businesses,” said Mercier. Mercier continued that some companies may need expertise in a particular area, but they don’t have it internally, so Chiefly & Co. can fill that gap with a fractional executive. Those people have been in executive roles before, so they can easily embed themselves and contribute value, helping organizations meet both commercial and sustainability goals, she explained. “We’re bringing domain expertise and industry expertise into that business, so we would very carefully match a fractional executive with an organization to make sure it’s a good fit and we can deliver on those goals,” Mercier said. Mercier built her team through connections she has culled throughout her career. As she moved into fractional work as a COO, she met other like-minded women—currently, all Chiefly & Co. talent are women—and decided she could create something that brought sustainability to the forefront. She has a collection of CEOs, CSOs, CMOs, talent officers, CXOs and CTOs who have worked for companies including Deloitte, Gap, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase to scale for brands seeking top-level fractional talent.

Title: What's Happening With FMC Stock?

UKRAINE - 2021/05/31: In this photo illustration the FMC Corporation (Food Machinery and Chemical ... [+] Corporation) logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) FMC Corporation stock (NYSE: FMC), an agricultural science company focused on products to improve crop yield and quality, currently trades around $64 per share, roughly 51% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $131 seen in April 2022. FMC has fared much worse than its peer – CF Industries stock (NYSE: CF) – down 10% over this period. FMC stock has been weighed down after falling sales volume and destocking dampened its financial performance over the last year or so. Its business in Latin America also took a massive hit, with sales down 33% y-o-y in 2023. FMC saw its stock trading at around $101 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it’s still trading 36% below those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period. The decrease in FMC stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FMC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $130 implies that FMC stock will have to gain around 2x from here, and we don’t think that will materialize anytime soon. We do think FMC stock has a some room for growth. It currently trades at 2x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 2.3x seen over the last three years. Notably, the $72 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 12% upside from here. Our detailed analysis of FMC Corporation’s upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. 2022 Inflation Shock Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how FMC stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis FMC and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis FMC stock declined 20% from nearly $18 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak for the markets) to $14 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It bounced after the 2008 crisis to levels of around $20 in early 2010, rising nearly 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. FMC’s Fundamentals Over Recent Years FMC Corporation’s revenue declined from $5.0 billion in 2021 to $4.1 billion in the last twelve months. This can be attributed to lower sales volumes amid destocking of its products. A drought in Brazil last year also weighed on its sales. Not only did the company see its sales decline, its operating margin contracted from 22.5% in 2021 to 13.9% now. However, there has been some recovery this year. The company’s Q2 sales were up 4% -y-o-y on an organic basis. The North America region led this growth with sales rising 24% y-o-y. Its adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share were up 26% y-o-y. Looking forward, FMC expects its revenue to be in the range of $4.30 billion to $4.50 billion in 2024, reflecting a 2% decline at the midpoint versus 2023. It expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.64 per share, reflecting a decline of 12% at the midpoint versus 2023. Does FMC Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock? FMC’s total debt increased from $3.3 billion in 2021 to $4.2 billion now, while its cash decreased from $517 million to $472 million over this period. The company also garnered $481 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Given that FMC’s market capitalization is $8 billion, a debt level of $4 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of around 50%. Its cash as a percentage of assets of under 4% is low. This implies that the company’s financial position isn’t great. Conclusion With the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe FMC Corporation stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the pressure on the company’s sales volume and a large debt obligation, remains a significant risk factor to realizing these gains. While FMC stock has room for some gains, check out how FMC’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Sam Altman and former Apple executives are making an AI device

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman is teaming up with former Apple (AAPL) design executive Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, to start a new artificial intelligence device company. Ive confirmed the project Tin in an interview with the New York Times published Saturday. According to the former Apple executive, it all started when Airbnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky — a close friend of Altman’s and client of Ive’s design company, LoveFrom — arranged for the pair to meet for dinner last year. From there, Altman and Ive continued to meet, and decided that they would build a new device, with Ive responsible for the design. Ive and Emerson Collective, a firm founded by Powell Jobs, have already contributed, according to the Times. By the end of this year, the startup could reach $1 billion in funding. The secret project already has a physical office space and 10 employees. Key staffers include Tang Tan, who headed product design teams for the iPhone and Apple Watch, and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Ive as Apple’s design chief. Ive left Apple in July 2019 after nearly three decades with the iPhone maker, and founded his own design studio, LoveFrom, shortly after. The Information first reported talks between Altman and Ive over an AI hardware project a year ago. Meanwhile, Altman’s OpenAI, the company behind popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, is in talks with several investors to raise billions of dollars in new funding, which would value the company at more than $100 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The funding round is reportedly drawing big names, including Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) — which is in talks to potentially contribute $100 million. The latter owns a 49% share of OpenAI’s profits after contributing approximately $13 billion to startup, including $10 billion in backing in January 2023. Over the past two years, OpenAI has become the most influential generative AI company on the market. ChatGPT hit 100 million weekly users earlier this year, and kicked off the genAI and chatbot boom with the success of its flagship model. With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball. A deal allowing employees to sell stakes in the company valued OpenAI at $86 billion late last year, nearly triple what it was earlier in 2023.With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball.

Title: Intel is having a brutal year — but suddenly everybody wants a piece of it

Intel (INTC) is reportedly in talks for two multi-billion dollar deals — including a takeover — as the struggling chipmaker continues to draw interest from investors. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to invest as much as $5 billion. That comes just days after The Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm approached Intel with a takeover bid. Intel stock rose 4% to $22.69 per share in pre-market trading Monday. After missing revenue expectations for its second-quarter earnings in August, the once-dominant chipmaker’s stock fell 27%. The company reported revenue of $12.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024, falling short of Wall Street’s $12.9 billion estimates. The earnings miss was partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. So far this year, Intel has seen its stock slide 54%, as it falls behind new rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. To help give its business a boost, the Santa Clara, California-based company last month announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That includes reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel has also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC. But it’s looking to mount a turnaround, starting with several billions of dollars worth of investments from a pair of lucrative contracts announced last week. The Department of Defense and Department of Commerce announced Intel had been awarded up to $3 billion in direct funding under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave, which is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. Also last week, Intel and Amazon Web Services (AMZN) announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar collaboration to advance U.S.-based chipmaking in Ohio. David Dietze, senior investment strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management (PGC), previously told Quartz that the AWS partnership and additional federal funding could mark the beginning of a turnaround for Intel.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF options approved by SEC, creates hopes of gamma squeeze

Experts believe that the approval would pave the way for more diverse funds providing exposure to Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) product, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Options trading enables investors to buy or sell assets at a pre-determined price, helping them speculate on price movements. So, this decision marks another step toward broadening the range of Bitcoin-linked derivatives, offering investors more tools to manage exposure to the flagship crypto asset. However, the product still requires the approval of the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that other major firms might soon receive approval for their own Bitcoin ETF options. He said: “Huge win for the the bitcoin ETFs (as it will attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish).” Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, suggested that approving options for spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to the development of more Bitcoin ETF-based products. Geraci stated: “Expect a flurry of various ETF filings like Bitcoin buffer or defined outcome ETFs, Bitcoin premium income or yield max (covered call) ETFs, Bitcoin tail risk ETFs, Bitcoin convexity ETFs.” Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies and portfolio manager at asset management firm Bitwise, pointed out that Bitcoin options will likely generate strong institutional demand, setting the stage for a gamma squeeze. A gamma squeeze occurs when stock prices rise rapidly because market makers buy more stock to cover their options positions, driven by high demand for call options. In Bitcoin’s case, Park explained that the Bitcoin ETF options market introduces regulated leverage on a supply-constrained asset. He added: “With Bitcoin options, investors can now make duration-based portfolio allocation bets, especially for long-term horizons. There’s a good chance that owning long-dated OTM calls as premium spend will give investors more bang for their buck than a fully-collateralized position that could drop by 80% over the same period.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

The SEC also charged TrueCoin and settled with both companies, with the payment of $163,766 in civil penalties each. Despite approving options trading for IBIT on Sept. 20, the regulator claimed it needs more time to consider the decision on Ethereum ETFs. After a four-day slump, Polymarket's trading daily volume spiked led by U.S. elections-related activity. Commissioner Hester Peirce testified during the hearing and stated that the agency can provide clarity but failed to do so. Despite approving options trading for IBIT on Sept. 20, the regulator claimed it needs more time to consider the decision on Ethereum ETFs. AI tokens performed over double the market average performance in the past seven days, with Bittensor's TAO in the spotlight. The recent rally is likely driven by derivatives trading, which might prompt a consolidation period without significant spot volume.

Intel (INTC) shares are surging in premarket trading as Apollo Global Management reportedly mulls an investment, days after another report of a Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover approach; Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Dell Technologies (DELL) become members of the S&P 500 today; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building UAE chip megafactories; AstraZeneca (AZN) shares are falling as its breast cancer drug misses its target; and China's sudden call for a press briefing tomorrow is raising expectations of a massive stimulus plan by regulators. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the Federal Reserve's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut last week. Here's what investors need to know today. Intel (INTC) shares are jumping 4% in premarket trading after Bloomberg reported on Sunday that asset manager Apollo Global Management has offered to invest as much as $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker. The news came after The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday afternoon that Qualcomm (QCOM) has approached Intel about a potential acquisition. Intel shares have lost more than half their value this year. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stock is slipping 1% and Dell Technologies (DELL) is edging lower in premarket trading as the two companies join insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE) in becoming members of the S&P 500 today. However, the data-analytics firm and the PC maker have both seen their shares gain in the runup to today's benchmark index entry. The companies will be replacing American Airlines Group (AAL), Etsy (ETSY), and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO). Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new factories in the United Arab Emirates to meet surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." AstraZeneca's (AZN) American depositary receipts (ADRs) are falling about 2% after the pharma giant said its experimental cancer drug datopotamab deruxtecan, jointly developed with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo, failed to meet goals in a Phase 3 breast cancer trial. The news comes just weeks after the Anglo-Swedish firm said a late-stage trial of the same drug didn't significantly improve patients' overall lung cancer survival rates. China announced plans for an ad-hoc press briefing tomorrow on the economy by its financial regulators, including its top central banker—fueling investor hopes that Beijing is planning to issue large stimulus measures to boost the hard-hit economy. Bloomberg reported that some economists are expecting the regulators to cut policy rates or the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and also measures to support the country's troubled housing market. The People's Bank of China also lowered its 14-day reverse repurchase rate Monday.

Title: Atlanticism or Sovereignty? Fight in Germany Continues With Latest State Election
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/09/atlanticism-or-sovereignty-fight-in-germany-continues-with-latest-state-election.html
Time Published: 2024-09-23T10:00:28Z
Full Content:
Last week the European Parliament passed a resolution that calls for Western countries to strike inside Russia with long range missiles, the confiscation of Russian assets, and ever tougher sanctions against Moscow. It received the support from 425 MEPs — a slight decrease from the parliament’s first document adopted after the June elections, which called for Ukraine support for as long as it takes was supported by 495 MEPs out of 720. In Germany, the sputtering engine of the EU, voters are making it increasingly difficult to keep up with the chutzpah of the European Parliament. The biggest Russia war cheerleaders like Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock aren’t quite as vocal as they used to be following the beating voters delivered to them in June’s European elections and recent state votes. Yesterday’s state election in Brandenburg, which encircles Berlin, provided a temporary respite for Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s beleaguered Social Democratic Party (SPD), which came in first with 30.7 percent. The sovereignist, enthno-nationalist Alternative for Germany placed second with 29.5 percent. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), another sovereignist party that focuses on antiwar and working class issues, came in third at 13.5 percent. The SPD’s first-place finish isn’t as impressive as it would seem. The party, which has ruled Brandenburg since German reunification, saw its support decline from 31.9 percent in the last election in 2019, and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was likely sacrificed in order to get it there. The CDU plummeted from 23 in 2019 to 12 percent with many voters throwing their support behind the SPD. Crucially, the Greens fell below the five percent threshold, which means they will not be have any seats in the state parliament. That rule in Germany, intended to prevent gridlock, now looks more likely to help produce it. The initial results mean that the SPD will have to form a coalition with either the AfD or BSW. Regardless, the AfD will have 30 out of 88 seats, which due to the “firewall” pact among parties not to work with the AfD, means it will have the ability to block decisions and elections that require a two-thirds majority, such as the election of constitutional judges. There is just one more state election on the calendar (a March vote in Hamburg, an SPD stronghold) before next fall’s national elections. While all three September state elections (Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia) took place on fertile ground for the AfD and BSW, the results are still striking in a Germany known for its cherished stability. The results in Brandenburg mean that the AfD took home two silvers and one gold.The BSW, essentially a one-woman party that formed only nine months ago, came in third in all three races. The two insurgent parties took everything the establishment could throw at them, and voters still made them serious challengers in the political battle over Germany’s future that is just beginning. US Colony or Sovereign State? In an effort to halt the rise of the AfD and BSW, all of the major centrist parties are now supporting much stricter immigration control. One can see why as immigration has consistently topped voters’ list of concerns — unsurprisingly when the record levels of immigrants coincides with a retracting economy, a housing crisis, and social spending cuts. Despite the endless warnings against the dangers of the AfD’s anti-immigrant positions, all of the center parties were quick to throw the immigrant welcome mat overboard when the AfD and BSW started attracting more voters. They have not been willing to touch the broader issue of vassalage to the US and a self-defeating Russia policy, however. They might be forced to. It is going to be impossible for the center parties to govern in the three eastern states without Wagenknecht’s party (or without giving up on the AfD firewall). And what does Wagenknecht want in return? She’s looking for the CDU to make concessions on support for Project Ukraine and even more importantly when looking to the future, the stationing of US long range missiles in Germany. And it’s possible that similar coalition math could be in play after next year’s national elections if the AfD and BSW can continue to peel away voters from the Atlanticist center. Here’s the current state of polling: As of now, this would mean only 5 parties in the Bundestag, and the CDU would be forced to side with its fellow Atlanticists, the SPD and the hated Greens, or forget the firewall and team up with the AfD. But a year is a long time. The major problem for the three parties of the ruling traffic light coalition (SPD, Greens and Free Democratic Party) is that all signs point to the economy continuing to tank and their support will likely continue sink along with it. Border controls to keep out immigrants won’t do anything to keep industry in. Companies that rely on cheap and reliable energy continue to leave the country due to Germany’s Russia policy. As long as Berlin is working more for Atlanticist interests rather than national ones, it will be almost impossible to turn the economy around, as well. Germany is now under pressure to get rid of its China dependency the same way it did with Russia. The consequences like loss of access to critical minerals, which China increasingly controls, are rarely considered. And so here’s Germany provocatively sending its Navy ships through the Taiwan Strait. Nobody is too sure what this achieves other than showing Berlin’s commitment to Washington’s goals. Or maybe the government in Germany is just a glutton for punishment. Aside from Ukraine, no one has been hurt more than Germany by war against Russia. The loss of Russian natural gas drove the final nail through the coffin of Germany’s economic model, the reverberations of which are still being felt. Here we are 2.5 years later and Berlin is now struggling to phase out coal. All the economic news out of the country is an endless stream of bad to worse. Intel just canceled a planned microchip manufacturing center. Volkswagen is looking at closing some operations. And many other crown jewels of German industry are doing the same. This would be bad news anywhere, but especially in Germany where manufacturing still accounts for nearly a quarter of the German economy and employs 20 percent of the German workforce. If the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines (and ensuing damage to the German economy) severed the relationship between Moscow and Berlin, the plan to station US long range missiles in Germany starting in 2026 is an attempt to guarantee it remains severed. A more sovereign Germany would not be “supporting” Ukraine, the state that was behind the Nord Stream bombings according to Germany’s own investigation. Berlin would be working to get the gas flowing again. And it certainly wouldn’t agree to host US missiles aimed at Moscow. The centrist Atlanticists of course endorsed that latter move while the AfD and BSW opposed it. From DW: “Chancellor Scholz is not acting in Germany’s interest,” said Tino Chrupalla, co-leader of the AfD, which continues to oppose German arms deliveries to Ukraine. “He is allowing Germany’s relationship with Russia to be permanently damaged, and we are falling back into the pattern of the East-West conflict,” Chrupalla said, adding that the US missile deployment would make “Germany a target.” And that’s the point. It locks Germany into a self-destructive role on the frontlines of the New Cold War. That’s a position that already requires hundreds of billions to in support for the German economy. The German business association BDI just released a study claiming that 20 percent of industrial value creation in the country is under threat. At the top of the list of causes is high energy prices and it says Germany needs about $1.55 trillion of investment by 2030. Businesses looking for help covering the self-imposed energy crisis aren’t the only ones looking for more money from Berlin. As Project Ukraine reaches its inevitable conclusion there is no sign that the hostility towards Russia will abate (see the European Parliament vote above), and Germany is also facing pressure from all sides to pony up for common EU debt that would be used to purchase more expensive and less reliable US liquified natural gas and fund military purchases by the bloc. The hits are likely to keep coming for Germany as the economy continues to slide, social spending is cut further, military spending increases, and even more pressure is piled on to “derisk” from China. All that means that the newfound concern about immigration likely ain’t going to cut it with voters, and the Atlanticists are going to have an increasingly difficult time keeping up the hardline Russia positions as the AfD and BSW continue to increase their support. Looking Forward to 2025 From the German sovereignist side, there was some hope that the CDU might be consumed by infighting ahead of the 2025 national elections the same way they were in 2021, which could open the door to further AfD and BSW gains. CDU chief Friedrich Merz and the head of Bavaria’s conservatives, Markus Soeder, recently buried the hatchet, however, and Merz will be the undisputed CDU candidate for chancellor. The CDU remains at the top of national polls and is fortunate to be out of power as the economy worsens. Merz, however, is also a former Blackrock executive and is not well-liked. As of now, Merz fully supports Atlanticist positions like continuing to support Project Ukraine and the sationing of the US long range missiles in Germany. Can Wagenknecht force a change there through government-forming negotiations in East Germany states? We’ll see. There is ongoing talk of Chancellor Scholz stepping aside ala Biden, but the election results in Brandenburg yesterday likely bought him more time. While the SPD didn’t completely embarrass itself like it did in the June European elections and the two state elections earlier this month, Scholz’s chancellorship is still on life support. He remains historically unpopular, and the party’s win in Brandenburg likely had to do more with the governor’s popularity as well as the strategic shift in support from the center-right CDU to the center-left SPD in order to prevent an AfD win. It would still be surprising to see Scholz as the SPD candidate next year. Defense minister Boris Pistorius who has been pounding the table for endless military spending ever since he was plucked from the obscure position as the Lower Saxony State Minister of the Interior and Sports is the man who’s always named as Scholz’s likely replacement. He continues to be the most popular politician in Germany. Why? Well, at least one recent poll shows that a clear majority of Germans support more national defense spending. It wouldn’t make much sense to promote him to chancellor now as that would mean he’d start to receive the blame for the slow economic collapse. Best to switch out Scholz closer to the 2025 election and present Pistorius as the face of change. Habeck is already slated to be the Green candidate. The party somewhat inexplicably still polls around 10 percent, but then again the party is also sometimes described as a cult. National AfD support has leveled off in recent months, but it might still have the chance to become the CDU’s junior partner in the next government. Would that mean the AfD caves on some of anti-NATO and German sovereignty positions or does the CDU continue to move towards the AfD as it has on immigration? And then there’s Wagenknecht, head of the party that bears her name and one that is still building itself out after launching nine months ago. How much higher of a ceiling does she have? Her broad appeal suggests a decent amount more — if she can continue to connect her antiwar stance to the dire straits of the economy. The AfD voter is typically younger, male, less well-educated, and working class, and the CDU is more heavily supported by older, wealthier voters. Wagenknecht, on the other hand, draws voters more evenly from across social demographic groups. Despite all the media efforts to lump Wagenknecht and the AfD together as Kremlin-controlled, anti-democratic far-right threats, the fact is the parties are polar opposites. Just a few examples: Unlike the ruling coalition, Wagenknecht has been careful not to criticize AfD supporters, and unlike other parties, Wagenknecht says she will work with the AfD on issues where there is overlap, i.e., Russia and NATO, since that’s about the only area of common vision. The simultaneous surge from the AfD and Wagenknecht is putting the CDU between a rock and a hard place. Either uphold the firewall against the AfD and form alliances with BSW after making concessions to Wagenknecht on long range missiles and general Russia policy. Or bring the AfD, which has been dubbed the second coming of Hitler for years now, into power and potentially dent CDU support in the process. Either way, the post-WWII German “consensus” of stable center coalitions is quickly coming to an end. Considering how much damage the current government has done to Germany, it can’t come soon enough. The problem is that even if — and it’s a big if — the AfD and/or BSW can succeed it making Berlin work for German interests again, the world isn’t standing still while Berlin tries to sort itself out. Russia’s economy, unlike Germany’s, wasn’t dependent on the Nord Stream pipelines as it is simply redirecting supplies towards China, India, and others as part of its Eurasian integration. Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin still insist that they’ll turn on the gas in the one Nord Stream pipeline that is still operational. Germany hasn’t taken them up on the offer. While German industry would likely be facing difficulties these days one way or the other due to its decades-long reliance on the wage suppression model, a lack of investment, and the rise of Chinese manufacturing, the loss of cheap and reliable Russian energy made it so all these problems are now weighing on Germany simultaneously. The Greens’ insistence that Germany close its remaining nuclear power plants only made the situation more dire. In the meantime, things could always get worse before they get better. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck is today hosting representatives from Germany’s once-powerful automobile industry at a “car summit” to determine a way forward. With Habeck’s track record, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the steady flow of industry out of the country turn into a stampede for the exits following the meeting. Excellent overview. Thanks, Conor, for a more sensible analysis than most commentators employed by German media are capable of. The anti-AfD hysteria has been off the charts, with supposedly serious pundits hallucinating that it’s 1933 all over again. Excellent summary. The legacy parties are shit scared of peace in Ukraine. If Puin is clever and grants the existence of Ukraine provided she won´t become part of NATO the inevitable question in Germany will be what was all of that for? Everybody knows that and therefore the German political establishment is just as shitless as Selensky. Wagenknecht´s problem is that she opposes Nationalism but her opposition to NATO is based on the politics of Germany first. She won´t admit that but it unites her with the AFD to an extent that is utterly scandalous to the ruling elites. Let´s see what happens. I can only hope that she ignores the firewall. The legacy parties are shit scared of peace in Ukraine. Maybe being in an anglophone bubble has inured me with cynicism, but I don’t understand why the parties would care. Can’t they just ignore the issue and get the media to pivot to something else? Germany was set up as a Parteistaat. If Lenin designed CPSU to be Vanguard of Proletariat then German Parties were entrusted to embody the General Will in German State and they divided up the spoils. Lots of jobs depend on political alignment and not only in public sector. Then there is Atlantik-Brücke and any politico looking for US Dollar privilege needs to belong. There are lots of ways to serve USA Germany uses Direct Mandate plus List. Greens have 16 directly elected MPs and 113 on List like Baerbock who has no constituency unlike Habeck The List is a Party thing and where you are on the List is key – so if you get 5% across nation you get extra seats and more taxpayer money for Party. Germany has largest legislature on earth – then again in terms of physical structure White House is a shack compared to Federal chancellery in Berlin Parties are rich – SPD owns a cruise liner and FDP has a castle in Spain – SPD owns lots of newspapers Ladies and gentlemen, consider this statement: “Nobody is too sure what this achieves other than showing Berlin’s commitment to Washington’s goals.” I ask, Is there a better definition of slavery? Outstanding article. Thank you. Tom67: Let´s see what happens. It’s already clear what will happen. [1] In 2-3 months the issues of immigration and Ukraine will converge in Germany as Ukrainians flee West because of the wintertime collapse of Ukraine’s energy grid, which is foreordained as the Russians have already destroyed sufficient grid capability. An already-overstretched Germany has no means — no housing, schools, etc — to receive another 500k migrants, and under ordoliberal economics German cities and villages, whose mayors repeatedly have said the boat is full, will be particularly hard hit. [2] The German national system will therefore reel as it hasn’t done since WW2 and the current utterly inept political leaders, having demonstrably not a clue, will have no recourse but denial of the problems, which will then worsen and become more destabilizing. [3] Because Germany was the industrial economic motor of the EU, the EU will also increasingly become destabilized. As this will be occurring simultaneously with the US election and its outcome — also inevitably destabilizing there, whoever the notional winner — Putin has no reason either to discontinue the slow grind in Ukraine and the consequent degradation of US/NATO capabilities, or to accept any rump Ukrainian state that might pretend it won’t enter NATO only to rescind its word a few years later. Putin and Russia are thus most likely to continue the war till Ukraine has effectively been flattened as an independent nation-state with any potential to be a threat to Russia at any time in the foreseeable future. Not incidentally, here’s the mirror world version of Conor’s piece, from the FT and its editor Germany, political extremism and the risks to Ukraine archived – https://archive.ph/MKZQV original – https://www.ft.com/content/b009c2e6-790f-489d-98e6-c36e856401bb “Combine the AfD vote with that of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and something like a third of Germans — and many more in eastern Germany — are voting for populist parties that are militantly anti-migration, hostile to Nato and determined to cut off aid to Ukraine. When Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Bundestag in June, all but four of the AfD’s 77 members boycotted his speech. “The policy stances taken by the AfD and BSW, combined with accusations that many AfD members have an undeclared agenda that is even more extremist, mean that Germany’s traditional parties will refuse to go into coalition with the populists — at least at the national level. But the rise of the political extremes is already having an influence on government policies. Germany’s decision to impose border controls with its EU neighbours reflects the angst about illegal migration that the populists have capitalised on.” And so, blah, blah, blah. I read Gideon Rachmann’s book Easternisation, he is a total US stooge, why do these people lie so easily, they have no morals?! (Not surprised the Chinese banned him). Your first phrase might turn to be exactly the factor that clicks the political shift button, and not only in Germany. Though i am probably being too optimistic as usual. In the news in Germany yesterday they claimed that a large part of the voters who cast their ballot for SPD did that not because they like SPD but to block AfD from winning. Fascinating that they actually allowed this piece of information go through. SPD is standing on a house of sand. “I don’t care who votes. I care who counts the votes.” Or words to that effect. I registered some fleeting content recently that claimed the legacy German parties successfully changed the recent “outcome” in an important local election from cold to hot, by means of post-hoc “discovery of discrepancies. “ Was I just dreaming this, since the article makes no mention of electoral finagling? Though I think that in most of the West, elections are just window dressing to “legitimize” the rules the elite adopt for us mopes, based on pure assumption of power. Yes, seemingly 75% SPD voters claim to have voted SPD to block AfD. These voters were apparently 60+ and AfD expresses concern about Postal Vote harvesting in retirement and nursing homes There is nowadays 30% postal voting in elections and it has been a feature in fraud in U.K. and US and Germany Conor, thank you so much for this window into German politics and the German economy. Most enlightening. US Colony or Sovereign State? A Colony Yes, how can a state be sovereign when it’s occupied by tens of thousands of foreign soldiers? One thing AfD can do however is push for a Committee to investigate COVID in at least 3 state legislatures which can only discredit CDU and SPD and CSU As for the one German frigate ‚menacing‘ China – even though it is at 7000 tonnes a bit overweight and under- gunned it poses no threat to Chinese Type 052 or Type 055 vessels Germany is a bit of a joke in that it cannot even crew its ships The country has been under US supervision since Dawes in 1924 and even the 1933-45 Chancellor was funded by US patrons and supplied by Standard Oil and Brown Bros. throughout war. In 1947 US arranged with Adenauer to give him his Rheinland Republik as a Catholic CDU stronghold and jettison the Protestant East as a Soviet Zone Since 1990 ALL leaders of CDU have been Protestant and its Catholic identity is gone. It now has worst relations with France since 1940 and probably the same with Poland whereas Russia is at 1941 levels. AfD is the Party of East German Youth who want a change from the corrupt party system – watch Fassbinder movies to see what I mean – he had exquisite gems like Lola – he was insightful All this sailing by US & Co is not to threaten Mainland China, but to keep the Taiwan Straights open and not subject to Chinese control, as it would be if the alliance would be seriously recognizing One China Policy rather than just paying lip service… Peter Lee aka China hand mused once that the Chinese escalatory ladder doesn’t involve ramping to an invasion on Taiwan, but declaring the straights internal waters under Chinese jurisdiction and impose such control. NATO treaty doesn’t provide for attacks outside those countries territories… I thought distance between China and Taiwan was 180km but that navigable channels were much narrower China could note busiest sea lane is English Channel where French sovereign waters overlap with British being 22 miles apart yet international shipping moves and even warships access these waters Turkey in contrast has Montreux Treaty defining rights of passage China has reasons to be wary of Western warships after what was done to China in 19th and 20th Centuries >Diddy/Puff Daddy After scrolling through Tweet after Tweet on this person, I finely looked him up just now. All I knew is that he is some kind of rapper, that there was a video recently of him beating up his girlfriend. I’m not interested in that music/genre. There are three topics that seem to be dominating my feeds, Israel continued genocide/aggression/censorship, Ukraine, and Diddy. Sean Love Combs (born Sean John Combs; November 4, 1969), also known by his stage name Diddy, formerly Puff Daddy and P. Diddy,[4][5] is an American rapper, record producer and record executive Apparently this guy is the Jeffery Epstein of Hollywood with overlap with politicians. All I can conclude is that the rot has metastasized through many different strata of this society. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs Sorry, I should have posted this under the daily Links. Don’t worry, an interesting segue! And then there’s Wagenknecht, head of the party that bears her name and one that is still building itself out after launching nine months ago. How much higher of a ceiling does she have? Her broad appeal suggests a decent amount more — if she can continue to connect her antiwar stance to the dire straits of the economy. Wagenknecht sounds like one of neoliberalism most hated foes: Traditional left opposition. The neoliberal system has traditionally been very effective at crushing or coopting such opposition, which ultimately left room for only wingnuttery. But now as “mainstream” parties fall into ever more political, economic, and cultural wingnuttery themselves, increasingly skittish middle class voters are beginning to look around for exits (to date blocked with aforementioned wingnuts). But seeing as how the main stage appears to be on fire anyway, and the entrances are stuffed with street-fighters, suddenly the old left/labor fire-exit next to the mouldy storeroom is looking like a brighter spot to camp. If you think the surveillance state has been harsh on online dissidents, wait till you see how politicians like this get treated. “Wagenknecht sounds like one of neoliberalism most hated foes:” Yes, a bloody grownup who has no difficulty in detecting her arse from ahole in the ground. LOL, truly excellent comment! Thanks! Hadn’t heard that expression for a long time!! The party somewhat inexplicably still polls around 10 percent, but then again the party is also sometimes described as a cult. It’s the party of the German PMC (“Müslibourgeoisie”). The Greens have succesfully catered to the material and ideological interests of its core electorate (urban, academic, West-German). It lost the trust of young voters, but other than that it’s doing just fine. Not inexplicable at all. It is called the Asylindustrie. Psychologists, teachers, administrators, doctors, dentists, lawyers, asylum officers, property owners (the government pays good reliable rent and renovates the properties afterwards), construction people, used car dealers all are feeding at the immigration trough. Our local hospital is busy and full mostly with asylum seekers. It is the only remaining growth industry in Germany. The tend to vote Green. Thank you, Conor. Not entirely off topic. I would like to bring to the attention of readers to an appointment in France. Benjamin Haddad has just been appointed European affairs minister. Not only is he a Macronist, but, perhaps, less well known, associate of von der Leyen and US MIC funded think tanks, so Atlanticist. Readers may have come across recent interviews given by Dominique de Villepin. One can compare the pair and lament how far France has fallen. the fallout from the quackery of free trade will take decades, if we last that long. Gerhard Schroder the bill clinton/tony blair of germany, sacrificed german labor and investment, to ride the surplus from free trade, to the detriment of just about all E.U. countries. free traders are of course idiots, that think a system like that is sustainable. everything was sacrificed for exports. now the under investment, and suppressed labor rights has come to bloom. germany became overly dependent on other countries and lost its sovereignty. germany now faces what the west faces. they are dependent on the east. and they somehow think that they now have leverage over the east. germany will end up resorting to terrorism like the rest of the west, its all they have left. thus you sail your ships(fat open targets) thousands of miles away. in a desperate hope to have some leverage. In terms of the question posed in your headline, we shouldn’t forget that German “sovereignty” is an idea that has always made neighbours of that country nervous, and continues to do so. A Germany firmly anchored in NATO and the EU and a loyal ally of the US was a Germany other people could live with. The Germans knew this, and up until a generation ago were the loyalest of allies and the firmest of orthodox believers. Reunification, economic strength, the decline of France and Brexit have complicated things a lot, and I’m not sure the German system has been able to adapt quickly enough. The German psyche continues to be a mystery to the rest of us. It seems that only Russia is not affraid of a sovereign Germany and never was… Sorry, humbly disagree. The fundamental tropes have changed. What you are referring to were fears – as I understand – rooting entirely in pre-1945. The basic assumptions of how power works and has to be sold have changed. Even if supremacist convictions still exist. I would argue they do so in neo-colonialist forms in ALL of EU. Not only Germany. EU´s power projection has shrunk by magnitudes since 1939. So today they have to unite forces to terrorize the world one last time. Which would pit against each other not Germany and her neighbours but Europe and her neighbours. After all European WMDs are unlikely but with a jingoist EU Commission not out of this world. And then what? How will the situation look like in 15 years? Will the world more likely be trembling of a rogue Germany or rather a rogue EU equipped with nukes of its own? – after a US focusing exclusively on China has agreed on letting lose (which under very desperate circumstances they might really do. As part of sharing with EU the work to fight BRICS.) p.s. What I dare not predict is the fate of the EU if US were forced to retreat in the very long term. When unipolarity has de facto ended and the EU been overtaken in all areas. But by then German clout will have completely gone up in smoke. And thus its potential for harm and cause for fear. And then e.g. what is Poland going to do with its huge army of tanks? Attack Turkey (as the biggest sparring partner so to speak)? Will Europe then fall apart in 3 or 4 mini-alliances? In that respect your point again very much deserves consideration but with the other powers not to be dismissed. EU did not exist in 1939 not until after 1993 in fact. There is no EU Military – US will not permit it since it would undermine US control of NATO Germany like Italy has a major demographic problem. In addition Europe has no nuclear weapons – only U.K. and France do – and they are of doubtful value. Germany will break up. It has never existed within the same borders for more than 40 years in its entire history. It has no internal logic. If you google Allied maps for 1945- you see different constellations for Germany envisaged by different Allied leaders EU itself is dying. It was essential for Germany as a captive market but now German Capitalism is footloose in China and USA so does not really need it – German Banks used to own German companies in interlocking shareholdings before Schröder gave them a capital gains tax benefit and they sold out and became US style gamblers in financial markets Germany is in NATO because of Diem Bien Phu. Germany had an army because of Korean War. EEC was created by Treaty of Rome to enable rearmament in Germany pushed by USA – to be acceptable to France which had rejected the European Defence Force in 1954. US had to bribe Turkey to let Germany join NATO by forcing Germany to import its male overpopulation as labour – and Germany called them Gastarbeiter. France got to control iron and steel through EEC and when Germany reunified at US insistence and against wishes of U.K. and France – Mitterand made Germany give up D-Mark so France could control Bundesbank as ECB – Germany got to have ECB in Frankfurt as a sop Asking myself what would change if – in a fictional scenario – AfD in 2025 were to form the government with Alice Weidel as chancellor. Something tells me not much. Leave the EU? Nope. Unless they would be teaming up with BSW as second or third force in parliament and Wagenknecht doing what Oskar Lafontaine had been doing shortly, as minister of finance. And possibly creating enough energy to do some major economic changes on a quid-pro-quo deal basis. But what in fact would change? Ending support for Ukraine? Open cooperation with Russia? Repairing NS2? All of that would merely be a status quo ante. Be a bit harsher on immigration than SPD already is? Most changes might concern fringe areas as freedom of theatres and art funding – perhaps. So what are people hysterical about? Law enforcement biased against true left groups? Already is. Racist? Already is. So this would only matter if this were expanded into a what-if over Wagenknecht and BSW leading the country instead. But that´s even less likely. I am not even sure AfD has enough good people to actually staff all necessary posts. p.s. the only single issue where something could happen for real is to stop the planned stationing of missiles. It´s the least controversial among oppositional groups and easiest to grasp for anyone. (WORLD WAR 3, “we-all-gonna-die” kinda thing) The Politicians who shut down Murican Bases and kick out NATO-Murican Troops being hosted there for Tours should make it happen. A rough translation of a Bismarck quote from of one the commonplace book I kept as a student 60 years ago which seems to me to get to the essense of the problem Germany and the rest of the Collective West have created for themselves: “Don’t think that in taking advantage of Russia’s weakness, it will pay you dividends forever. Russia always comes for its money. And when it comes – don’t rely on any agreement you’ve signed. Agreements are not worth the paper they are written on. Therefore, play fair with Russia, or don’t play”. President Putin is a great admirer of Bismarck and has read about him widely and deeply; it seems that the for the present German leadership, history began in 1945 and Bismarck and statecraft just doesn’t enter into it. Three things I learned from my Russian students are, they don’t lie; they so what they say; and they have no respect for you if you do no observe these niceties. Excellent overview. On the manufacturing front, there is Volkswagen’s (VW’s) ditching of the 87-year old job guarantee and threat to close facilities in Germany. Already smaller auto-suppliers are throwing in the towel (all in German and still have not learned to do links): Erwin Lutz https://www.merkur.de/wirtschaft/deutscher-autozulieferer-ist-insolvent-alle-mitarbeiter-erhalten-kuendigung-93300203.html Recaro Automotive https://www.chip.de/news/Traditioneller-Zulieferer-insolvent-Naechste-Pleite-in-Autoindustrie_185394808.html WKW https://www.merkur.de/wirtschaft/insolvent-autozulieferer-insolvenz-firma-wkw-wuppertal-vw-bmw-mercedes-zr-93313169.html Recaro was bought by a Detroit-based private equity firm in 2020 called Raven Acquisitions. They might have just done a private equity thing and they are dumping the workers, the IG Metal contracts and factory in high cost Germany. In the old days if business slowed down companies in Germany would slow down production and cut costs and wait it out but that is not the private equity style. If Raven Acquisitions owns the patents and designs maybe they can build the seats cheaper in China or Mexico or license the name to some Chinese or Indian company. They were a specialty maker and I always liked their seats and had them in my Porsche and my Mercedes. People that wanted Recaro seats were not price sensitive. So going bankrupt does not sound like a good explanation. It sounds more like US financial engineering than not being able to make money in good seating. Actually Recaro is alive and well. It sold off its automotive seating to Johnson Controls in 2011 and Johnson split and Adient became new owner. Recaro licensed its name but continues to make aircraft seating and gaming chairs etc It’s difficult for me to contain my glee (or Schadenfreude, I perhaps should say). When one auto parts manufacturer after the other goes insolvent like that, and Volkswagen AG is planning to shut down German factories for the first time since its founding in 1937, those are not good signs. This especially since I remember Audi (part of the VW Group) sort of leading the anti-Russian charge, complete with Ukrainian flags in its advertising. Now Volkswagen AG are leading the pack into oblivion. Good riddance, and the same to the rest of German industry. 150 years as an industrial power are ending and they will *never* come back. Germany’s demographic cliff, its lack of sufficient natural resources of its own (shared with the rest of Europe, to which I don’t count Russia), and the way it has burned all bridges not just to Russia but to the entire global South with its top-of-its-lungs cheerleading of the Zionist genocide will prevent that. As someone above said, it’s a distinct possibility that Germany itself will be ripped to shreds, basically returning to its natural state. Is it just me who thinks that ‘Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)’ was created expressly to split the anti-establishment/anti-atlanticist vote? It will be interesting if BSW and AfD are able to work together to, for example, try and end the war in Ukraine. As far as I can tell, it’s just you. Die Linke was not anti-Atlanticist in any real way. Excellent overview and analysis, Conor! Thank you for keeping us updated about the situation in Germany. Hoping BSW will continue to do well.

Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Bitcoin ETFs attract broad-based inflows while Ethereum sees minor activity. On Sept. 20, Bitcoin ETFs saw a total inflow of $92 million, reflecting broad-based interest across multiple funds, according to Farside data.. Fidelity’s FBTC led the market with $26.1 million in inflows, followed by Ark’s ARKB ETF with $22 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF recorded $15.1 million, while Valkyrie’s BRRR and VanEck’s HODL ETFs added $5.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively. Invesco’s BTCO also contributed with $3.1 million in inflows, and Grayscale’s smaller BTC ETF saw $13.4 million. No significant activity was noted from BlackRock’s IBIT, Franklin’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, or Grayscale’s primary GBTC fund, which remained flat for the day. Ethereum ETFs, in contrast, were largely inactive, with a total inflow of only $2.9 million, entirely attributed to Grayscale’s mini Ethereum ETF, ETH. All other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, Franklin, and Grayscale’s larger ETHE, recorded no inflows or outflows. The marked difference in activity between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights a focused institutional interest in Bitcoin exposure, while Ethereum ETFs saw limited engagement.

Title: Nvidia gets almost half its revenue from just 4 customers. Here's who they might be
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ai-chips-customers-google-microsoft-meta-amazon-1851653971
Time Published: 2024-09-23T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers. While the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing. Nvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one. Here’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips. In July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million. “Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion. “Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said. And while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24. Google announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities. In August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers. Months after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times. In April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing. Meanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan. While Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS. However, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs. In March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever. In July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April. Meta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B. Meta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4. In September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps. The AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.” Microsoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks. In March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT. In May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said. Tesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging. “There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.” In September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app. Tesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap. Musk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.” When it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors. In September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks. In May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”

Title: Five Dividend Achievers Raising Dividends Last Week

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks I invest in Dividend Growth Stocks. These are companies that have managed to increase dividends for many consecutive years in a row. This is not a small achievement. Out of thousands of companies that are traded in the US, there are about 500 or so that have managed to increase annual dividends every single years for a decade. In order to get there, a company has to have increased earnings for a while. Getting to a ten year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases is typically an end result to a company with a unique business model, with some solid competitive advantages, which can deploy capital at high rates of return, but cannot deploy all capital at those rates. It ends up gushing a ton of cash, showering shareholders with a rising stream of cashflows. In general, companies that initiate dividends and raise them have tended to do well over time. This study from Blackrock found that dividend growers and initiators did better than dividend cutters & eliminators between 1979 and 2023. Those dividend growers also did better than non dividend payers as well as better than S&P 500. Anywho, as I mentioned above, I invest in Dividend Growth Stocks.

Its decision marks another step in expanding the range of derivative products linked to Bitcoin, providing investors with additional tools for managing exposure to the world’s largest crypto. BlackRock had been seeking approval for such a listing since at least March of this year following the regulator's approval for multiple Bitcoin-linked ETFs in the U.S. The SEC’s approval follows several amendments submitted by Nasdaq ISE, which sought to address concerns over market manipulation and excessive risk-taking in the fledgling crypto options market. It follows several requests to amend rule changes to allow for the listing of options tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., which have faced resistance over market stability concerns. A key amendment sets position and exercise limits for options on IBIT at 25,000 contracts—described by the exchange as "extremely conservative" given the size of the market and the trust’s liquidity, SEC filing records show. Options on IBIT will be physically settled and feature American-style exercise, offering a hedge for investors looking to manage Bitcoin-related risks. BlackRock’s ETF, which tracks the price of Bitcoin, has attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors since it launched earlier this year, becoming one of the most liquid Bitcoin-related products in the U.S. market. Despite the approval, the SEC's move comes amid ongoing concerns about the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency derivatives. Comment letters submitted during the review process highlighted worries over market volatility and the broader integration of crypto into traditional financial markets. Some urged the SEC to delay approval until the Bitcoin market further stabilized. In any case, the SEC found that the exchange’s surveillance mechanisms, including real-time monitoring and inter-market surveillance-sharing agreements with the CME, would be sufficient to deter manipulation.

Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview Zachary Z. Horsington This article reviews the concept of twin insurgency and its constituent components of criminal insurgency and plutocratic insurgency in order to illuminate case studies of oil theft in Nigeria and Brazil. Gilman’s concept of twin insurgency represents a fusion of Sullivan’s concept of criminal insurgency, and Bunker’s concept of plutocratic insurgency.[1] Mutually, these concepts are essential to perceiving the threat environment associated with Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as both cases feature blurred criminality and politics conducted by a range of networked twin insurgent threat actors and their accomplices. As such, Gilman, Sullivan, and Bunker’s concepts concerning the criminal-plutocratic insurgent nexus will be examined, as well as a number of other corresponding irregular warfare theories, before the Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft case studies are investigated in detail. Crude Oil Barrells, Niger Delta, Stakeholder Democracy, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Twin Insurgency Sullivan’s theory of criminal insurgency describes a threat spectrum of criminal evolution between first generation ‘turf’ gangs, and third generation insurgent criminals, differentiated by their politicization, internationalization, and sophistication.[2] First generation gangs are highly territorial, localized, and limited in political scope, though they nonetheless “undermine the ability of the state to perform its legitimizing security and public service functions” through their low-level unlawfulness.[3] They are typically confined to neighborhoods, where their activities are not highly sophisticated, as compared to subsequent generations.[4] Second generation criminal organizations, on the other hand, attempt to coopt “bureaucrats and elected officials of a targeted political or security entity,” for profit motivated reasons.[5] “They may embrace a broader political agenda (albeit market focused), operate in a broader (sometimes multi-state) context, and conduct more sophisticated operations,” as they typically leverage emerging net-warrior capabilities.[6] As compared to first generation gangs, there is more expanded territorial and international reach, more complex internal self-organization, more diversified criminal activity, and typically an increase in violence and/or threats of violence against non-aligned individuals.[7] Finally, third generation entities seek exclusive zones of autonomy, to “de facto (in fact, whether legally or not) transform [themselves] into states-within-a-state,” which are able to leverage “authoritative allocation of values [and resources] in that social or physical terrain”.[8] Thus, “third generation gangs are mercenary/political gangs able to exert a combination of market and political influence to control territory”.[9] Their “evolved political and economic aims” contest, if necessary “the state monopoly of violence in a particular geographic space,” exploiting warlordism, “corruption, privatization of public goods and relativism of all kinds”.[10] Sophisticated criminal insurgents may also leverage near full-spectrum, all-domain capabilities to support their activities when required.[11] Gilman argues criminal insurgents are often fashioned from “the global disenfranchised,” and concurs with Sullivan that they espouse micro-sovereignties beyond mere profit motivation.[12] Such entities “resist, coopt, and route around states as they seek ways to empower and enrich themselves in the shadows of the global economy”.[13] Simultaneously they “deploy their resources to corrupt, coopt, or challenge incumbent political actors,” although the distinction between criminal and political violence is certainly blurred.[14] Conversely, Bunker describes plutocratic insurgents as “high net worth globalized elites,” who seek to insulate themselves from “public spaces and obligations—including taxation—and to maximize their ability to generate profits transnationally”.[15] Through predatory capitalism, corruption, public looting, the privatization of public spaces, stateless tax avoidance, and lobbied tax cuts, plutocratic insurgents evade both the law and accountability in luxurious techno-palaces.[16] Often in consort with criminal insurgents, such threat actors also seek to consolidate favorable transnational micro-sovereign enclaves.[17] Gilman observes that transnational plutocrats increasingly disassociate their personal accomplishments “from the success of the national societies in which they reside”.[18] While some individuals continue to perceive a “debt of obligation to the societies in which they have enriched themselves,” this is a scant and shrinking minority.[19] This has resulted in self-reinforcing positive feedback loops whereby: “plutocratic insurgents increasingly see no reason to contribute anything to their host societies and, indeed, actively contest the idea that citizenship comes with economic responsibilities”.[20] Thus, many are highly open to engaging in corruption, as they see no reflective value or responsibility in influencing efficacious and equitable state functions. Criminal and plutocratic insurgents “thrive in (and indeed try to foster) weak-state environments,” while at the same time their operations reinforce conditions of weakness.[21] They may migrate and attempt to reshape their environment to exclude competitors and insulate themselves from legal and public accountability. Plutocrats have insurgent potential to exploit transnational systems and local grievances overseas to expand their operations. The intersection, overlap, and symbiosis between criminal and plutocratic insurgency is a polycephaly Gilman describes through the concept of “twin insurgency”.[22] Both insurgents frequently cooperate and compete with each other to carve out de facto micro-sovereignties and zones of autonomy by disemboweling and decimating anyone’s capacities to constrain their activities. The final landscape consists of “diverse enclaves of heterogeneous political authority and of non-standardized social-service provisioning arrangements”.[23] As these non-standard arrangements materialize, “national and local authorities proliferate a variety of increasingly one-off exceptions to the general rules, incrementally traducing the liberal notion of equality before the law”.[24] The subsequent “proliferation of exceptional and unique micro sovereignties” enables further “jurisdictional arbitrage,” and non-state demands for “sovereign exceptions”.[25] The twin insurgency may also privately run select services and security traditionally provided by the state, and the civilians who live in these pseudo/semi-autonomous sectors of insurgent control “increasingly recognize the insurgents rather than the hollowed-out state as the real source of local power and authority”.[26] Ucko and Marks argue there may be merit in applying irregular warfare/counterinsurgency approaches to respond to sophisticated organized crime.[27] “The point is not to militarize further the response to organized crime. Instead, counterinsurgency in its theory is a political activity. Its contribution to consideration of organized crime is to cast the phenomenon as fueled by specific political and social drivers which must, alongside the criminal actors, also be addressed”.[28] While Ucko and Marks do not explicitly delineate the threshold whereby a criminal threat actor should be responded to with irregular war/fare approaches beyond traditional law enforcement, Sullivan, Bunker and Gilman’s arguments regarding criminal sovereignty interests transcending greed befittingly provide more clarity on this.[29] This demands the population be considered the center of gravity regarding warfare aspects, and sovereign dysfunction concerning the war itself.[30] Nonetheless, Ucko and Marks highlight how traditional organized crime responses have a “tendency to view the state unquestioningly as a provider, and its enemies as the threat,” which ignores “the very heart of the problem: a lack of government legitimacy and split loyalties among the population”.[31] They emphasize how legitimacy is not static, and instead “subjective, fluid, contextual, and contested; nothing can be taken for granted”.[32] Thus, “the state cannot in any way assume to hold legitimacy merely because it is duly constituted or has legal status”.[33] Ucko and Marks argue that political elites oftentimes are “more interested in retaining power and privilege than addressing the reasons for strife” when tackling irregular war/fare threats.[34] They note tendencies “to militarize even ‘whole-of-government’ endeavors,” and resource allocations in favor of kinetic operations in such situations, both of which realize actions disconnected from any “viable political process that gives military activity strategic meaning”.[35] Legitimacy can be shaped through coercion, although “sustaining cooperation is made easier if co-option also plays a role. Either way, gaining legitimacy means more than emotive affinity; it also involves a self-interested calculation that such loyalty is likely to pay off”.[36] Their arguments reflect “the artificiality of the state in many insurgency-threatened contexts,” and highlight how “in such contexts, the attempted imposition of the state can be deeply counterproductive”.[37] Ucko and Marks advise instead interfacing with “local structures that regulate life away from the state, so that they may be co-opted to benefit both center and periphery within the context of a loosely unified national compact,” as these “local institutions are often seen as more legitimate by the local population”.[38] Ucko and Marks champion “the state underwriting and empowering informal variations on the periphery, thereby satisfying local needs, empowering local political allies, and contributing to a desire to be part of, rather than resist, the state at the heart of it all”.[39] This is – of course – easier to write than realize. However, their arguments provide nuance in perceiving organized crime as “not an extension of a foreign body to the existing system, country or infrastructure,” but instead as a “product of a country’s history, its social conditions, its economic system, its political elite and its law enforcement regime”.[40] They remark that “this is not an invitation to moral relativism”.[41] Instead, their arguments offer a kaleidoscope to consider “why social contracts and political settlements are fueling organized crime,” in order to better “distinguish between crime as a coping mechanism and crime as exploitation,” while – of course – scrutinizing “the state’s role in enabling either”.[42] Doing so may enable better differentiation “between foot-soldiers, who in dysfunctional conditions can readily be replaced, and the organizers of criminal activity, who are more inaccessible and may even enjoy some level of state protection”.[43] Hackett argues that sovereignty defines irregular war.[44] While the population may be considered the center of gravity regarding the warfare, the dynamic construct of sovereignty should be considered the center of gravity for the war itself.[45] Previous discussions surrounding the motivations behind Irregular Warfare are highly dichotomous: there is ‘our’ political will and ‘theirs’.[46] Thus, Hackett’s arguments go beyond and consider dis/functional sovereignty as publicly dynamic and intersocial.[47] Hackett defines irregular war as: “the apotheosis of conflict between the people and the state, a violent dialectic between a faction and a sovereign expressed outside existing political institutions”.[48] He argues that the “intervening factor is sovereign dysfunction, and its presence in the conflict leads to irregular wars in which insurgents, conventional forces, and ­third-party interventions seek to preserve, destroy, or transform the state through organized political violence”.[49] Hackett describes sovereign dysfunction as “the disconnect between a state’s de jure (legally recognized) structure and its de facto behaviour, especially in the liminal space between what the people demand, what the state promises, and what is delivered”.[50] Counterinsurgency understands that there is no military solution, but instead a “military component to a larger strategy that is framed in political ends, flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert through the direction of a single, unified leadership and grand strategy”.[51] While this seems a basic understanding, Hackett observes throughout the Cold War and the Global War on Terror that thought, practice, and disconnection expose enduring institutional gaps associated with reconciling and interfacing ‘sovereignty’ and public opinion to extinguish irregular threat actors.[52] It is how McChrystal’s Task Force 714 were able to defeat al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) highly efficiently, but could not comprehend the genesis of Islamic State.[53] It is why Afghanistan is governed by the Taliban again today, and how Islamic State and al-Qaeda continue to gain territory across Africa and Asia. This discussion related to sovereignty and irregular war is all the more significant considering climate change and the climate-conflict nexus.[54] Schmidt’s concept of Discursive Institutionalism is particularly relevant here, as is Däniker’s concept of The Guardian Solider.[55] If state security apparatuses seriously want to better understand Irregular War/fare, in identifying the population and sovereignty as its center of gravity, they must function as more dynamic, socially discursive institutions. Lythgoe (2020) argues against hyper-decentralized command: it is not so much how centralized or decentralized your system is, but how dynamic it is in fluidly interpreting the right state, at the right time, for the right context.[56] The same elasticity is required to inform dialogic interactions in the public domain. However, this is all highly counterintuitive for state security apparatuses, which typically consider secrecy/transparency as binary, see public exposure negatively, and seek minimal partnership.[57] It is understood that the Information Revolution has transformed state/non-state capacities into self-organized, leveraged instruments of power in novel, efficient ways. The fields of Netwar and Chaoplexic Warfare examine this potential.[58] General Stanley McChrystal’s concepts of a ‘Team of Teams’ and F3EAD (i.e., find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, disseminate) represent applications of these ideas at the most sophisticated and classified level.[59] These theories accentuate complex adaptivity and decentralized operations, although they do not explain how the system should best treat independent feedback in the public domain and public partnership. Indeed, a critical short-coming concerning Information Operations (IO) identified by Lieutenant Colonel Norman E. Emery, of the US Army, is that it “neglects a key target of irregular warfare: the relevant population not categorized as adversarial”.[60] Security apparatus-public affairs currently function as a one-way street: operations are coordinated through public channels to either support ‘friendly’ forces or disadvantage ‘adversary’.[61] It is clear that the global threat environment has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. While many of the components of twin insurgency have existed long before Gilman, Sullivan and Bunker, their nexus, hybridization, and capacities today manifest in novel ways that challenge current institutional understanding, jurisdiction, and best practice.[62] As highlighted by Ucko and Marks and Hackett, institutional gaps concerning these threats are not unique to the past or any one nation: more clarity is needed and more discursive methods need to be tested.[63] All these theories are highly relevant to consider when examining Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as state responses have been, and continue to largely be, highly securitized/militarized. Nigeria functions as a mono-economy, depending on oil for over 95% of its export revenue, 6-9% of its GDP, and 70% of its total budget expenditure.[64] More than 90% of its oil production occurs in the Niger Delta Region and offshore.[65] The magnitude of oil theft in Nigeria is astronomical. Between 2009-2020, the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) found that 619.7m barrels of crude were lost due to theft and sabotage, valued at ₦16.25t (USD46.16b).[66] Security, repairs, and maintenance of damaged assets cost the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) ₦136b (USD91.48m) in 2023.[67] This is slightly less than the ₦147b (USD98.88m) they spent in 2022.[68] Unprecedented revenue losses were observed between 2019-2022 (USD2.1b, USD1.9b, USD7.2b and USD22.4b respectively).[69] In 2022, losses to theft were upwards of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd).[70] In 2023, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu cited loses of 400,000bpd to thieves.[71] Losses for this year are estimated at 470,000bpd, although many speculate the figures are much higher.[72] This equates to roughly USD700m lost to theft and vandalism each month.[73] In January 2023, Nigeria’s national oil production rate was 1.4m bpd (condensate and crude) [74] – 1.5m bpd was reported in February, falling to 1.2m bpd in March.[75] For the same three-month period this year (2024), the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) reported: 1.6m bpd, 1.5m bpd, and 1.4m bpd respectively (condensate and crude).[76] However, separating crude from condensate reveals: 1.32m bpd in February, 1.23m bpd in March, and 1.28m bpd in April.[77] While the situation may be slightly improving, Nigeria is nonetheless tight-rope walking its OPEC quota of 1.5m barrels per day, and clearly relying on condensate to veneer its production.[78] The state of Nigeria’s oil facilities is also dire. The Federal Government owns four refineries, although none are currently operational.[79] Two may be online by the end of this year.[80] Likewise, out of 57 Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) displayed by the NUPRC, about 33 are non-producing oil blocs.[81] Government security efforts offshore have been successful, although they have arguably displaced and entrenched threats onshore. The International Maritime Bureau indicates a decline in offshore criminality within the Gulf of Guinea since 2021.[82] Nigeria accounted for 17% of reported incidents in 2021, compared to 42% in 2020.[83] While no incidents were reported offshore in 2022, onshore oil theft that year was the worst Nigeria has ever experienced. Indeed, most incidents offshore in 2021 occurred in anchorages, ports and harbors, which should have signaled signs of threat displacement.[84] Considering Nigeria’s oil is produced mainly in the Niger Delta, it is here where the majority of oil theft occurs. The displacement of the pirates closer to the coastline and back ashore since 2022 has only magnified onshore oil theft and the diversity of threat actors involved. The graph below shows NNPC reported weekly cases of theft for the first few months of 2024.[85] Igbintade finds monthly case numbers oscillate around 1,337.[86] Udi (2024) finds the majority of reported theft cases occur in the Central and Eastern regions of the Niger Delta, with less and less occurring offshore in deep water.[87] Figure 1: NNPC Weekly Reported Theft Cases [85] The situation is so bad that Shell recently decided to completely divest its onshore assets and exclusively operate offshore.[88] While the Federal Government recently announced that Shell, Total Energies, and Exxon Mobil have committed to invest USD13.5b over the next two years to increase Nigerian oil output overall, a number of significant challenges need to be overcome before any robust security can be realized.[89] The 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom contributed to the outbreak of Nigeria’s Civil War, although Biafra’s oil wealth and Federal Government opportunism should not be understated as causes as well.[90] As argued by Okwelum, “Biafra’s independence would certainly have cut the nation’s [potential] oil wealth production in half,” which they argue influenced the Federal Government to extinguish any chance at Biafra secessionism.[91] Niger Delta communities continue to experience ethnic disenfranchisement, external exploitation, and livelihood insecurity. Niger Delta underdevelopment and persistent pollution is not merely a product of local criminality and oil theft: persistent federal mismanagement, corruption, and greed define national resource allocation and economic activity.[92] It has been estimated that more than 80% of Nigeria’s oil and gas revenues benefit just 1% of the populous.[93] Simultaneously, 50% of Nigeria has been designated impoverished by the World Bank, and 40% of those under age 25 in the Niger Delta Region are unemployed.[94] The recent removal of government fuel subsidies has not helped to remedy the situation.[95] In 2007, Nigeria’s unemployment rate was 6%; in 2019, it was 30%.[96] More generally, the Nigerian Federal Government has not harmonized economic development and reinvestment into the country’s surging population.[97] Currently at 200m, Nigeria’s population is set to double by 2050.[98] Current policy and practice cannot accommodate such growth. Recent protests highlight how government disenfranchisement is fervent nationwide. Nigerian food inflation stands at 40%, and according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the country already has the highest number of food insecure people on the planet (31.8 million).[99] The naira (currency) has lost 70% of its value against the US dollar over the past two years, following two devaluations.[100] Petrol prices are rising sharply, and electricity droughts continue to plague large swaths of the population.[101] National food, economic, and power insecurity will continue to magnify instability across the Niger Delta, unless more substantive internal transformation occurs. As such, Niger Delta grievances are likely to persist and deepen. Animosity is also directed against foreign oil corporations, who are perceived to be a neo-colonial presence in-country. They have long been considered by many Nigerians to be dishonest, exploitative, and/or ethnically/religiously prejudiced. In 1993, Shell operations were affected by over 100 communal disturbances, which contributed to the loss of approximately 12m barrels of oil, worth around ₦369b (USD248m).[102] Shell’s recent decision to move exclusively offshore reveals the company’s reduced risk appetite, although the decision is perhaps also influenced by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in favor of Shell regarding a USD878m oil spill case, which had previously halted the sale of its onshore assets.[103] Local apathy towards foreign oil conglomerates also stems from their reputation (whether warranted or not) for environmental degradation. Corporate community development initiatives have also been lackluster and at times outright counterproductive. They have willing called for harsh security responses against demonstrators, and have paid out millions to co-opt local chiefs.[104] The formal authority of chiefs is still not officially constitutionally defined, and is currently being reviewed.[105] Conflict has spiked before, and will continue to do so, until underlying dysfunctional sovereignty and the Niger Delta’s underdevelopment are addressed. Hundreds of oil facilities were vandalized between 1998-2003, and ethnic militias escalated between 2005-2010 to taking hostages, detonating cars, and attacking installations on-land and at-sea.[106] Losses in revenue related to direct attacks against Nigerian oil infrastructure cost the Federal Government USD6.8b between 1999-2004, and losses sharply increased again around 2006/7.[107] Bish et al. highlight that, while amnesty programs were introduced after the 2008 surge in Niger Delta violence, persistent low intensity conflict since 2012 indicates unaddressed and simmering grievances and tensions.[108] Indeed, the amnesty program itself has been scrutinized for its inconsistent Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) principles, lack of supplementary employment for many militants, sporadic salaries, discrimination, and generous stipends to select militant leadership.[109] The failure of demobilization and youth movements has further augmented the influence of cults, militia, and street gangs.[110] Thus, as argued by Okwelum, the disenfranchised communities of the Niger Delta region perceive oil theft to be a “display of local expertise and an entrepreneurial free market response to local economic dysfunction, chronic energy shortages, and government’s failure to deliver on basic public services,” rather than a criminal activity.[111] Historical legacy, underdevelopment, external exploitation and environmental devastation continue to fuel local resentments which transliterate into criminality, namely oil theft, in an attempt to alleviate “their impoverished condition”.[112] While many Nigerian Criminal Armed Groups (CAGs) espouse separatism or flaunt ethnic and religious sentiments, considering the dire economic situation in the Niger Delta, significant scrutiny is required to decipher and distinguish socio-political interests from financial motivations. Such distinction is necessary to discriminate criminal insurgents from organized criminals. While it is clear that dysfunctional sovereignty is apparent in the Niger Delta Region, clearer differentiation between these threat actors is necessary to better tailor state response. As argued by Okwelum: “The face of the jerry-can-wielding-rural-poor is not the face of oil theft.” Considering the flagrant and widespread corruption, “they are [merely] the foot soldiers paraded before the public as a decoy and deceit”.[113] As argued by Katsina, and Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda, structural, socio-economic, and political imbalances predominantly fuel Nigeria’s national security threats.[114] Until such factors are adequately addressed, twin insurgency will continue to thrive in Nigeria. Nigerian oil theft is not technologically sophisticated. Basic hot and cold tapping and scooping practices are widespread. Tanker interdiction occurs in littoral waters, and so-called artisanal refineries are pervasive across the Niger Delta Region. A spokesperson for Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited, a Nigerian private security company led by former militant leader Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo), recently said that: “Most of the [stolen] oil is locally refined from the Niger Delta. A vessel can bring 10,000tons from Europe, take 60,000tons from Niger Delta, and falsify the documents, claiming it is from Europe”.[115] Trucks are also used to transport stolen oil to “neighboring Cameroon, Niger Republic, Chad and so on. Nigerian oil goes everywhere”.[116] Oil is stored in sacks for handling purposes and camouflage.[117] To pass through the abundance of road blocks in Nigeria, a single number plate will be legitimately registered for transit, and forgeries of the relevant documentation will be used by multiple trucks.[118] No sooner is one tap or distillery shutdown before multiple replacements appear, “in a few hours”.[119] Moreover, “you will find women and children inside the bush working and contributing their share to the oil theft”.[120] Thieves often install CCTV around their taps to provide early warning against security forces.[121] Threat actors have attacked oil facilities with light weapons and explosives; industry personnel have been kidnapped; and many are implicated in egregious inter-ethnic/religious/community human rights abuses. Coordinated industrial action has also occurred. Threat actors are typically armed with indigenously produced small arms, although looting government stores and smuggling have provided more sophisticated weapons. In 2021, The Organized Crime Index ranked Nigeria far higher than the West African average (8 vs 5.5).[122] The Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Boko Haram are both known to loot government stockpiles, and the Cameroonian border towards the Southeast is known to be assailable.[123] Simultaneously, Nigeria’s indigenous arms manufacturing industry is ever-expanding. Indigenously produced models are typically four times cheaper than imported pieces, and a rudimentary pistol can cost as little as ₦3,500 (USD2.4).[124] For perspective, Nigeria’s official minimum wage is ₦70,000 (USD43) per month, although it is likely to be much less in practice. In 2022, a Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons estimated that 60% of illegal arms in circulation in Southeast Nigeria are artisanal pieces.[125] Nigeria’s artisanal light arms production is now a fully-fledged local industry, which will significantly complicate future DDR. Irregular threat actor groups associated with oil theft typically operate as cellular networks rather than as hierarchies.[126] Nearly all threat groups are resilient to leadership decapitation as well, as they operate cells, frequently referred to as ‘houses’ or ‘decks’.[127] Most oil thieves do not associate themselves with a specific threat actor group. Group affiliation and overt marketing typically attracts government attention and fierce response. Thus, most oil thieves affiliate informally across ethnic, religious, and community lines. Groups may be temporarily formed or revived, and criminals may participate across multiple groups and localities. Despite the opaque threat environment a few notable groups may be differentiated as insurgent criminals. Other, purely profit-motivated groups exist too, as do other less publicized separatist movements involved in oil theft. Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB): A separatist group founded in 2012 that seeks to re-establish an independent Biafran state.[128] The group commands significant influence over Nigeria’s ethnic Igbo community and claims resource/land rights within Biafra’s historic borders (present-day Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Cross River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Rivers, Imo States, Nigeria).[129] Mazi Chika Edoziem (previously deputy) is its new leader, as Nnamdi Kanu (leader since 2013 and British citizen) is currently imprisoned by the Department of State Services (DSS).[130] The group’s spokesman is Emma Powerful. Dr. Fredrick Onyeali and Onyekachukwu Ezemba are the original founders of the current IPOB movement. The group operates the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Black Marines as security forces. ESN is quite a sophisticated paramilitary entity, evidenced by a prison break in Imo State in 2021, which freed 1,800 IPOB inmates.[131] The group is still very active, and recently claimed the lives of six civilians and five soldiers in Aba.[132] The military responded by launching a raid which attempted to arrest those responsible, although six IPOB were killed in a firefight.[133] In April, 2021, IPOB formally allied itself with the Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC) and the Ambazonia Defence Forces.[134] The alliance was denounced by the Interim Government of Ambazonia as well as by other Biafran separatist groups. Niger Delta Avengers (NDA): Openly seeks to cripple oil production.[135] Threatened ‘Operation Humble’ in June 2021, a campaign of violence against the NFG, as well as the destruction of oil installations, although no attacks were publicly attributed to them after this statement.[136] Field Commander Tu-ere, (AKA Queen of the Creeks) was assigned to lead the operation, who was previously involved in bombing the Chevron Valve offshore platform in May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line in June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline in July, 2016. Known to operate in Ondo, Bayelsa, Edo, Delta, Imo, Abia and Akwa Ibom States, Nigeria.[137] In June last year, NDA spokesperson Mudoch Agbinibo called for: “The international community to come and support the restoration of our rights to peaceful self-determination… Since the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914 to date, our resources have been used to sustain the political administrative livewire of Nigeria to the exclusion of the Niger Delta… We want our resources back to restore the essence of human life in our region for generations to come because Nigeria has failed to do that. The world should not wait until we go the Sudan way”.[138] Unyekisong Akwa Ibom (UAI): Comprises former members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the Niger Delta Volunteer Force, Movement for the Actualization of the Niger Delta Republic, Niger Delta People’s Salvation Force, Niger Delta Avengers, Niger Delta Liberation Force and Niger Delta Movement for Justice and Niger Delta Warrior.[139] Akwa Ibom indigenes argue militant amnesty programs have consistently discriminated against them.[140] UAI views government amnesty/peace initiatives in the Niger Delta as inherently discriminatory and enablers of corruption. The group seeks to secure oil facilities within their territory, and issued ultimatums to the Nigerian government in 2021 and 2022, although no action followed.[141] UAI is believed to still be led by General Dede Udofia and Major Ibanga Ekang. Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND): Despite the group having officially dissolved, it is understood that factions/ethno-religious groups previously under the umbrella of MEND continue to operate independently to this day. Other groups that have previously attacked/threatened oil operations which may be active or have members acting autonomously: Niger-Delta People’s Volunteer Force; Red Egbesu Water Lions; Joint Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Red Squad; Niger-Delta Greenland Justice Mandate; Niger-Delta Youth Movement; Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People; Federated Niger-Delta Ijaw Communities; Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Civil Society Coalition; Coalition of Niger-Delta Agitators; Bakassi Strike Force; Niger Delta Vigilante; the Icelanders; and the Outlaws.[142] This list is not exhaustive. Cult groups are also influential, leveraging “whole communities, churches, schools- universities, secondary schools and even primary schools, government positions and political structures in the Niger Delta”.[143] Both cults and militia function strong traditional spiritual elements, “mainly based on the revival and strong influence of the Egbesu deity in Ijaw communities”.[144] Finally, many of these threat actors are sophisticated net-warriors as they involve themselves in complex and robust networks, however they may not be technologically elaborate and benefit from the ancillary operational security. Bala argues: “Nigerian security is influenced by a garrison military mentality”.[145] Joab-Peterside also argues that the “state’s approach to security is dominated by the character of deterrence exhibited by unrestrained willingness to show maximum force at the slightest hint of insecurity”.[146] Nigeria’s history of colonialism and 36 years of post-independence military dictatorship have influenced a status quo whereby “force is used for punitive rather than preventative and corrective purposes of civil law enforcement and justice delivery”.[147] Despite over two decades of democracy in Nigeria, its armed forces continue to preponderate over the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) regarding internal security operations. This is despite the NPF being “constitutionally created for and mandated for the task”.[148] The armed forces have displayed steadfast interest in managing internal security operations, oftentimes directly interfering with police efforts.[149] Simultaneously, the military persistently laments how overstretched its forces are and how distracted it is from its primary constitutional responsibility: defending Nigeria’s territorial integrity.[150] The tendency to militarize internal security response has resulted in significant internal distrust and rivalry between the armed forces and its civilian counterparts.[151] Agencies operate as silos and intelligence is more often hoarded, rather than shared.[152] Despite an inordinate amount of disbursement towards the armed forces and numerous kinetic and non-kinetic operations in the Niger Delta Region, oil theft and criminal insurgency remain entrenched. As argued by Hackett, there should only be a “military component” to a holistic grand strategy, “flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert,” which maneuvers a political end.[153] Nigeria’s military has dominated internal security operations since its independence, although the threat environment in the Niger Delta Region has not much improved. It is time to consider alternative methods and more efficacious and equitable federal resource allocation. The severity of the security situation in Southeastern Nigeria has seen the emergence of hybrid sovereign, non-state (often armed) groups in response to the criminality and weaponary. As mentioned previously, former Niger Delta warlord Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo) leads Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited. In August, 2023 Tantita was awarded a one-year contract worth ₦48b (USD32.3m) to provide security services to the Niger Delta Region.[154] This is not the first time the Federal Government has allegedly been contractually involved with Tompolo, as it bought 20 maritime patrol vessels worth over ₦15b (USD103.4m) from Global West Vessel Specialist Limited in 2012, a company widely believed to be owned by him.[155] Tantita currently claims to oversee 9m of its own staff, 38m community youth, and 22m intelligence agents.[156] There appears a clear conflict of interest, or at the very least collusion. Yet, Tompolo’s efforts have attracted praise, and his security forces have displayed successes in-field. Other private security entities do exist, such as Galaxy Security Services.[157] State governments have also established their own hybrid sovereign organizations to maintain security. In January 2020, all six Southern Nigerian states united to establish the Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) (a.k.a. Operation Àmò̩té̩kùn, i.e., Operation ‘to kill as fast as a cheetah’ in Yorùbá).[158] Àmò̩té̩kùncontinues to operate across all Southwestern Nigerian states except Lagos, with personnel comprising of “vigilantes, local hunters, community youths, farmers and menial workers”.[159] In April 2021, Ebonyi State setup the Ebube Agu Security apparatus.[160] This was formally disbanded by Nigerian courts early 2023 after evidence suggested the group was involved in “human rights abuses, extortions, illegal arrests and [illegal] use of fire arms”.[161] State governments command no constitutional power to arm indigenous security networks they form, and thus, many groups are in direct breach of Nigeria’s separation of powers and its monopoly over violence.[162] As argued by Bish et al. and Joab-Peterside, many of these state-level hybrid sovereign entities are politicized in the run-up to elections to support or deter certain candidates.[163] This not only undermines public confidence regarding the efficacy of the existence of such groups, but also erodes Nigeria’s democratic process, and contributes to escalating violence. Hybrid sovereign/private actors can provide stability if they are properly overseen and managed within legal frameworks. The presence of so many such actors, and the legacies of misuse, clearly dilute the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence and erodes Nigeria’s sovereignty. The NPF is significantly impeded in its ability to respond to threats associated with systematic oil theft in Nigeria. It functions as a federal police force. As argued by Baje, NPF officers are “inadequately trained, live in dilapidated barracks, and are poorly paid”.[164] At the same time, they are understaffed and/or are diverted to conduct personal private protection. The NPF officially employed over 370,000 officers in August 2023. Nigeria’s population stands at approximately 220m.[165] The International Association of Chiefs of Police recommended ratio of officers to citizens is 3.4:1000, and United Nations’ stands at 1:450.[166] Nigeria currently sits around 1:600, which is insufficient considering the domestic security situation. As argued by Ibrahim, this statistic is also undermined by the fact that around 150,000 of the officers are “engaged in VIP protection, rather than routine policing”.[167] While many Inspector Generals have committed to ceasing rented private protection services from NPF officers, the widespread practice continues.[168] A significant community policing initiative was launched in September 2020, whereby the government allocated ₦13b (USD35m) to absorb 10,000 new constables.[169] Not much has been gained from this, as underlying issues associated with NPF have not been rectified; corruption and mismanagement continue to be widespread; and the oil theft situation has not improved. As argued by Nigerian senator Orji Uzor Kalu, tapping and illegal refining “only make up for a small portion of the theft,” although their “environmental impact is vast”.[170] As argued by Senator Kalu, Okwelum and Tantita spokesmen, the plutocratic insurgency associated with coordinating and managing Nigerian oil theft represents a significant threat to national security.[171] Okwelum highlights there is a tendency to “inflate the quantity stolen in order to magnify the enormity of the scourge and justify the need for deploying the armed forces,” or to “minimize the quantity stolen in order to attenuate the adverse publicity it exposes the industry internationally and collaterally and in order to attract direct foreign investment,” when it suits the “state-oil-complex”.[172] Simultaneously, as argued by Garuba, the presidency of Ibrahim Babangida (1986-1993) also entrenched nepotistic Federal appointments regarding Nigerian oil officials who supervise the industry.[173] As argued by Moses, on the one hand “corrupt resident oil authority officials allow for the successful tapping of oil pipelines,” and on the other “the Nigerian security forces or militant organizations offer guided escorts for the transportation of stolen refined crude oil products”.[174] Indeed, security forces have frequently been accused of “facilitating the disappearance of captured vessels and re-appropriated sale of seized products to foreign markets”.[175] While the Nigerian Navy may report historic destructions of illegal oil refineries, as argued by Bish et al., oil thieves and site owners merely interpret crackdowns as “attempts to pressure them into paying bribes”.[176] Former Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, openly accused the Nigerian military of actively and systematically colluding with oil thieves, and Human Rights Watch cites widespread corruption across all Nigeria’s service branches.[177] On-land state security operations are known to be plagued with corruption too. For example, the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, personally witnessed state security forces associated with ‘Operation Positive Identification’ collect illegal tolls at a checkpoint along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway.[178] Such extortion justifiably ignites public outcry, and continues to undermine public perceptions of the Armed Forces. As argued by Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, a former commissioner in Ondo State: “[Nigerian] oil theft is not for the poor, it is an extensive racket involving the military, security apparatchiks, politicians, dubious industrial moguls and the oil companies”.[179] Nigerian plutocratic insurgency is naturally obscure, although plenty of admonitions exist, and persisting legislative gaps and elastic legal instruments continue to appear. Both the Ayo Irikefe Commission of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Shagari against the Obasanjo administration regarding missing oil assets worth ₦2.8b (USD1.9m) – and the Pius Okigbo Panel of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Abacha against the Babangida administration following the post-Gulf War oil bounce of the 1990s – were obfuscated and subdued by corruption.[180] Formal transparency and accountability measures associated with oil theft and federal inquiry have not improved at all. The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mallam Sanusi Lamido, has cited that between January 2012 and July 2013, the NNPC itself was defrauded of 594m barrels of crude valued at approximately USD65.3b, and was only able to recover approximately USD15.5b (24% of the total value) of this lost oil, therefore failing to account for roughly USD49.8b.[181] A more recent controversy involved the Deep Blue Project (DBP), an integrated maritime awareness scheme, led by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). DBP was funded from the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF).[182] The CVFF was established under the Coastal and Inland Shipping Act (a.k.a. the Cabotage Act of 2003) to foster indigenous tonnage to work within Nigerian waters.[183] Two percent of the CVFF was allocated to Nigerian ship owners so that they could borrow money from the fund at single digit interest rates for littoral cabotage trading.[184] However, in December 2021, a member of the House of Representatives accused NIMASA and then-Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi of diverting USD195m from the CVFF to fund the DBP without House approval.[185] This is despite the fact that no ship owner has successfully accessed the CVFF since its inception.[186] Extra-budgetary expenditures known as ‘security votes’ are also known to be flagrantly abused.[187] As highlighted by Bala, these funds are “not subject to the government executives’ declaration and not under the scrutiny of the public or even the established government auditing institutions of the anti-corruption agencies”.[188] These pseudo slush funds operate formally and informally, and are used to realize political and personal objectives. Transparency International exposed these ‘security votes’ account for around USD670m annually.[189] As argued by Bala, this dwarfs the annual international security assistance Nigeria receives. It is more than the Nigerian Army’s budget, more than the Nigerian Navy and Air Force’s annual budgets combined, and exceeds 70% of the Nigerian Police Force’s annual budget.[190] More transparent frameworks are necessary in order to restore public confidence, and more impartial resource allocation is desperately needed. Ex parte law is also brazenly abused, with the use of emergency judicial decisions in legal cases. Convener of the Transparent Bar Initiative, Douglas Ogbankwa, has faulted some law enforcement agencies regarding their frequently arbitrary and coercive use.[191] He highlighted that many ex parte motions “were done without the knowledge of the account holders, who should be aware of the situation in order to defend themselves”.[192] Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, also recently stated that the abuse of ex parte orders in political cases by judges should be curbed.[193] “To curb it, it is imperative that the National Judicial Council exercises stringent oversight. We recommend prompt and decisive punishment for judges who are found to abuse their authority in this manner”.[194] Significant legislative gaps also exist. Both Nigeria’s Terrorist Acts (2011 and 2013) lack a national definition for terrorism, and the Federal Government’s stance regarding negotiation with threat actors is not clear.[195] Likewise, no laws currently regulate the management of ill-gotten-gains associated with kidnapping and piracy following criminal capture.[196] Seized illegal proceeds are always forfeited to the Federal Government. Pervasive and systematic nepotism also undermines rule of law and due process. As highlighted by Bala, government/military appointments are typically defined across ethno-religious and political lines rather than meritocracy.[197] Such practices “breed disregard for the rule of law,” and jeopardize interagency synergy.[198] Prevalent corruption across Nigeria continues to create dysfunctional sovereignty, which will continue to encourage irregular threat actors. Nigeria currently does not operate State Police, although discussion regarding their formation is occurring in government. While some local police forces did exist in the 1960s, all were either eventually absorbed into the NPF or dismantled following military dictatorship.[199] The topic of state police has been fiercely contested, as many believe they should have been reinstated in 1999, following the end of military dictatorship.[200] House of Assembly speakers from across all 36 states recently announced their support for the proposal in a communiqué.[201] State legislators still need to endorse an official amendment to be passed onto the National Assembly.[202] However, two-thirds of Nigeria’s National Assembly must endorse it, followed by the President, for it to be realized.[203] President Bola Tinubu has championed and campaigned for State Police for decades, and thus he is unlikely to reject it.[204] Noticeable supporters include Senate President Godswill Akpabio and former President Goodluck Jonathan.[205] Although, while the Minister of Police Affairs, Senator Ibrahim Gaidam has shown his support, the Inspector General of Police directly contradicts him.[206] Many have argued for a long time that the adoption of state police would enable more effective and efficient policing.[207] Advocates highlight current limitations regarding the highly centralized command associated with the NPF. Nwogwugwu and Kupoluyi explain that a federally centralized police system alienates police as an institution and a service from rural communities.[208] As argued by Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda: “The peculiarity of the security challenges of each state can be better managed by the officers who understands the language, geography and the peculiar security challenge of the people they would be policing”.[209] Considering Nigeria is home to over 300 ethnic groups who vary across a range of social, religious, economic, and geographic factors, Tony also highlights the need for “a policing model that is adaptable and sensitive to local contexts”.[210] It is this line of argument, focused around “local exclusiveness”, which Senator Ibrahim Gaidam, Minister of Police Affairs, champions too. While states currently administer their own magistrates, high courts, assemblies and legislators, they do not command the concomitant powers to police their own territories.[211] While this does consolidate the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence, state sovereignty is affected, and the NPF remain spread thin across 774 localities commanded from Abuja.[212] Conversely, ex-Lagos police commissioner, Abubakar Tsav, stated that the “establishment of state police will signal the beginning of the disintegration of the country,” as he believes that state governments would deploy their new forces “against their perceived political opponents”.[213] In 2018 he argued that politicians “are not civilized enough and tolerant of opposing views and cannot preside over a competent and impartial police force”.[214] His sentiments have been echoed by many, including the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kayode Egbetokun, although such arguments often extend to also include ethnic, community, and religious adversaries too.[215] As observed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Abbas Tajudeen, “there is a palpable fear among our citizens – a fear of potential tyranny and the misuse of police powers if control is devolved to the state level”.[216] Indeed, the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) in 1958 and the Willink Commission both opposed regional police on these grounds.[217] Alternatively, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Ben Okolo, and the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi all suggest mending the dire state of the NPF first.[218] This includes hiring more officers, improving their welfare package, and enhancing overall NPF capabilities and infrastructure. Simultaneously, the Assistant Inspector General suggested merging the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Commission (NSCDC) and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) under the command of the NPF.[219] State police could very well be misused, and punishing such practices would represent a new responsibility for the NPF. Considering that the current separation of powers is murky, appropriate transparency and accountability measures could enhance state-federal cooperation, facilitate more autonomous state level security, and ultimately contribute to healthier national unity. In order to tackle the twin insurgency, the Federal Government must not merely continue to invest in improving its police and military, but also seriously consider more substantive and equitable socioeconomic development and DDR in the Niger Delta Region. Romsom argues that both Nigeria and Brazil “show characteristics of the state as smuggler model”.[220] While criminal insurgency is not so prevalent in Brazil, as the majority of criminals stealing oil do not overtly espouse sovereignty aspirations, plutocratic insurgency is nonetheless rife. Oil theft has evolved into a conspicuous threat in Brazil since around 2014, when it reported a single incident.[221] In 2016, 73 incidents were reported.[222] Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), the Brazilian state oil company observed that most of the oil theft that year occurred on the São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro axis, which is where five of the company’s largest refineries are located.[223] Above and below ground, hot and cold taps are erected by Brazilian oil thieves, much like in Nigeria, although the quantities they steal is markedly less significant.[224] In November 2023, approximately 30,000 liters of stolen fuel were intercepted by police, taken from the São Paulo-Brasília (Osbra) pipeline, which supplies the International Airport of Brasilia.[225] Four men were arrested, and around R$780,000 (USD138,000) worth of damage was inflicted.[226] Killings have been linked to oil theft operations, and there are indications that ‘turf’ wars exist between gangs regarding where their taps reside.[227] A few incidents have caused spills too.[228] Much like in Nigeria, criminals use tanker and water trucks to smuggle stolen fuel to concealed artisanal refineries, after which it is sold at illegal service stations or small-town, streetside vendors.[229] Brazil’s Federal Highway Police have increased the number of roadblocks they operate between Rio and São Paulo, although as observed in Nigeria, these may be easily circumvented by organized criminals.[230] Brazilian groups have previously generated false cargo invoices to deceive police.[231] Roadside hijackings of fuel trucks also regularly occur, with around ten cases a week occurring between the Gabriel Passos Refinery and the Ring Road.[232] Drivers do not typically suffer any injuries during these incidents, although the frequency with which they occur is increasing.[233] Brazilian law enforcement has responded and successfully dismantled many gangs associated with oil theft. Indeed, Transpetro, the logistics unit of Petrobras, reported a 60% decline in fuel theft at its pipes in São Paulo in 2020.[234] In June, three full and four empty trucks were seized in Fazenda Garcia, in Guapimirim, in the Baixada Fluminense, following an anonymous tip, which cited seeing 15 armed men.[235] A 100,000 liters of stolen fuel were seized, and one man was eventually detained.[236] Likewise, in May 2024 an adulterated fuel laboratory was dismantled by police, in Dias d'Ávila, Salvador, Bahia.[237] 600,000 liters of adulterated fuel were seized, including diesel, gasoline and ethanol, which was likely destined to be resold to gas stations.[238] Ten trucks and three fixed tanks were found (storing cargo worth R$3.3m [USD584,000]), as well as suction machines, hoses, gloves, dye, fuel symbology plates, samples of fuel types, and accounting documents.[239] Another adulterated fuel laboratory was also previously shut down by police in Feira de Santana, in January 2024.[240] Overall, theft overall costs Transpetro over R$150m (USD28.2m) a year.[241] Gangs may be quickly formed and dismantled, and may steal millions in less than a year.[242] A police operation in July 2023, which served 47 search and seizure warrants across Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Paraná exposed one such group.[243] Three chiefs oversaw the organization: one was responsible for scouts and drivers; another managed logistics and clandestine fuel derivation and extraction; and one was the financial director.[244] Specialists also included tap installers, recruiters who targeted professionals who worked mainly on oil platforms, welders, truck suppliers and false invoice forgers.[245] Harsher penalties were recently introduced specifically concerning fuel theft. In April, Brazil’s Infrastructure Commission passed bill 828/2022, which increased the punishment regarding theft of petroleum or derivatives, natural gas, hydrated ethyl alcohol, fuel, or other fuel fluids from four to ten years imprisonment, plus a fine.[246] Receipt of such illicit products will earn the same punishment.[247] Senator Alessandro Vieira also partially accepted an amendment proposed by Senator Luis Carlos Heinze to include biofuels as well.[248] The rapporteur added that the storage of such illegal fuel products may also be considered a crime.[249] Nonetheless, oil thieves in Brazil are markedly white-collar. Indeed, as argued by Slattery, Brazilian criminals “have infiltrated the four largest gasoline chains in Brazil,” whereby they are estimated to control “hundreds, if not thousands,” of service stations.[250] Paulo Miranda, head of the industry group Fecombustíveis, cites that First Capital Command (one of Brazil's most notorious organized criminal groups) controls approximately 300 gas stations in São Paulo state alone, which accounts for 3% of Brazil’s pumps.[251] Oil grafting at stations is lucrative, and Instituto Combustive Legal estimates the illicit industry to be valued at around R$23b (USD4.2b) a year.[252] Many groups also fence illicit petroleum products through asphalt companies too.[253] Oil criminals in Brazil also exploit petroleum tax regimes between states, as they vary widely region-to-region.[254] Ethanol tax in Rio de Janeiro is 32%, compared to 13% in neighboring São Paulo.[255] This creates huge incentive to conduct criminality across state lines. Brazilian think tank Fundação Getúlio Vargasestimated that criminals reaped approximately R$7.2b (USD1.3b) in 2019 through such fuel tax evasion alone.[256] Oil theft in Mexico has divulged into a glaringly similar situation to Nigeria, whereby billions of dollars of oil are unaccounted for each year by the state oil company Pemex. Colombia and Venezuela are also affected, although to a lesser degree. In Colombia, siphoned oil is increasingly refined into “pategrillo,” a low-grade fuel fabricated at illegal refineries used to produce cocaine.[257] Smith observes a positive relationship in Colombia between increased cocaine production and increased oil theft.[258] Considering that at least 22 organized crime groups operate across approximately one-quarter of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, it is likely that a similar dynamic functions in Brazil.[259] A myriad of similar, different, and competing hybrid sovereign and private security actors function policing across Brazil.[260] As argued by Durão, Larkins, and Argentin, the Brazilian federal police have not effectively regulated state branches regarding the widespread practice of ‘bico’, whereby police establish or participate in private security. Through a series of interviews, they discovered that such practices are “not only tolerated, but even encouraged by police superiors”.[261] “Rather than seeing the blurring between different fields of security and police and crime as signs of incomplete democratization or incomplete regulation,” Durão, Larkins and Argentin (2023) observe jurisdictional ambiguity as an “intentional productive force which allows for material gain for key actors, in this case police officers themselves”.[262] Nonetheless, they argue that “the confusion between public and private policing for some may essentially mean earning extra money, but for many others it constitutes an endless extension of power, violence, entrepreneurship and political influence”.[263] Such is the case in Nigeria as well, and both the Brazilian and the Nigerian government must do more to better regulate these non-state security forces to ameliorate public confidence, and/or strengthen and consolidate official state forces so that there may be no need for extraneous redundancies. Transparency International attributed a score of 36/100 (i.e., 0=highly corrupt and 100=very clean) to Brazil in 2023, placing it 104/180 on its global corruption perceptions index.[264] In 2012, Brazil scored 43/100, an all-time historic peak, just before the massive Lava Jato corruption scandal enveloped the state oil company Petrobras, and numerous contractors and politicians.[265] Brazil’s overall corruption is incrementally worsening, which will likely exacerbate oil theft across the country. Its security architecture has also been observed to be significantly affected by a lack of transparency, police brutality, machismo, and prejudice toward certain minority groups.[266] Simultaneously, Milícia have existed across Brazil for more than half a century.[267] Their current form spawned from Rio de Janeiro’s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s, under the pretense of residential narco protection.[268] Predominantly comprised of active-duty and retired police officers, milícia extort rent from communities under their assumed control.[269] In 2013, it was found that across approximately 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, 45% were controlled by milícia organizations and 37% by narcos.[270] Milícia are known to control telecommunication towers, internet cables, and TV providers, so much so, a special police task force had to be created in October 2020 to respond.[271] By May 2021, over 20 clandestine internet and cable TV providers were ceased and over 600 milícia members were arrested.[272] Losses to the economy were estimated near R$1.1b (USD195m).[273] 26 telecommunication masts across Rio de Janeiro were also compromised that year.[274] Milícia are known to participate in oil theft and the sale of bootleg product to service stations.[275] As argued by Sullivan and Bunker, “the state-militia nexus amplifies criminal competition for control yielding a hybrid form of criminal-political violence.[276] Information regarding corruption associated with Brazilian oil theft is scarce. Although in 2017, Brazilian police suspected insider threats in Petrobras to have helped setup illegal taps near the Duque de Caxias refinery, as they were observed to be precisely engineered.[277] Moreover, Marcelo Queiroz dos Anjos, a captain in the Military Police, was the head of an oil theft gang which operated in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense.[278] Although he surrendered to police in 2021, which accelerated the demise of his organization, the group nonetheless stole a total of 169,500 liters of oil and caused Transpetro/Petrobras a loss of about R$2m (USD354,000).[279] Police eventually arrested four others and served 14 search and seizure warrants.[280] Another gang dismantled in July 2023 involved three brothers, two military police officers, and an outsourced Transpetro employee.[281] The group had managed to inflict losses worth around R$1b (USD175m).[282] Considering that oil theft continues in Brazil, and the scale of influence organized criminals command across it, it is highly likely that insider threats persist. Petrobras is also a state-owned entity, so it is likely that insider threats extend into the Brazilian government as well, as Lava Jato revealed. Oil theft in Nigeria is dire, and the situation in Brazil reveals symptoms previously observed in Mexico. There is no universal response to threats associated with oil theft, although both the Brazilian and Nigerian governments can do more to remedy dysfunctional sovereignty and underdevelopment. Plenty of information is available regarding Nigerian oil theft, although more transparency, accountability, and enforcement around the issue is necessary. The prospect of State Police represents an exciting, albeit precarious opportunity for Nigeria, as their presence may be used to refocus state responses around more indigenous law enforcement, rather than predominantly kinetic military activities. Nonetheless, all Nigerian security forces must demonstrate better behaviour regarding discrimination, brutality, corruption, and extra-judicial abuse in order to mend public trust and de jure authority more generally. Industrial actors must also rehabilitate community sentiment regarding environmental degradation and exploitation. The Patriotic Liberation Front in Niger also recently attacked the PetroChina-funded Niger-Benin crude oil pipeline, paralyzing the pipeline and killing six, to coerce the cancellation of a USD400m China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) oil deal signed in April.[283] Onshore oil investment across West Africa will continue to be stifled if the security situation more generally does not improve, and the Nigerian government should be wary of how regional oil related instabilities influence violence and theft dynamics across the Niger Delta, and vice versa. Information regarding oil theft in Brazil as a whole is scare, although it is clear that elements of Gilman’s twin insurgency function at the pipes, the pumps, and among Brazil’s plutocratic elite. State security forces, much like Nigerian ones, have frequently dismantled oil theft gangs, criminal extractive tools, and illegal refineries, although the problem persists. Both countries are observed to operate/allow hybrid sovereign and/or private security contractors to combat oil theft. While a few have proven themselves, the patchwork of security actors involved nonetheless undermines and complicates state sovereignty, its monopoly on violence, and creates jurisdictional ambiguities. Regulation rather than standardization/absorption may realize more efficacious and fair security, as positive aspects of local tailoring may be exploited under adequate legal frameworks and oversights, although this is easier said than done. Nonetheless, all security sector reform must to be paired with significant government-community dialog and socio-economic development in order to dismantle environmental drivers which influence crime and insurgency. The Nigerian government has a lot of work to do before it can claim symbiosis with Niger Delta Communities, assuage foreign investors, and dethrone Algeria to once again become the leading African oil producer. Likewise, the Brazilian government must also do more to prevent the oil theft situation from deteriorating into that observed in Mexico.[284] Endnotes [1] Robert J.

Title: In 1962, being the worst in baseball was no bad thing

So, the Chicago White Sox looks like not just the worst team to date in the 21st century but in baseball history, too. As the seasons end, summer fades, and autumn leaves begin to drop, the White Sox are on their way to recording the most losses in the history of America’s National Past Time. Normally, most baseball fans root for records to be broken. Think of Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record, a mark that stood until Barry Bonds bested Aaron (although we still don’t know if performance-enhancing drugs made the difference), or Cal Ripken’s victory lap in Camden Yards when he passed Lou Gehrig in consecutive games played. The nation even cheered when Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb’s record for most hits in baseball history. Americans, especially rabid baseball fans, love the pursuits, probably because we have a deep affection for the player and partly because we all have a little Walter Mitty in us, which project onto our beloved athletes. That’s not the case for the White Sox’s record. Image: The 1962 Mets (cropped). YouTube screen grab. If they have the longest losing streak ever, they’ll erase the record of one of the most beloved teams—albeit a bunch of big-time losers—in baseball history, the 1962 New York Mets. If the White Sox beat that record, baseball will lose some of its charm and romance, for fans loved those losing Mets. The 2024 White Sox do not and will not have the personality, charisma, or legendary status the Mets had in 1962. The club mostly consisted of former Dodgers and Giants who had played in Gotham before those teams moved to California before the 1958 season and still paid homage to those esteemed franchises. (The old Dodgers and Giants had appeared in every World Series from 1947-1958 except for 1948, 1950, 1957, and 1958.) The Mets franchise filled the vacuum left by the teams that called Brooklyn and Upper Manhattan home. The first Mets team plucked old, over the hill or over-their-head players off LA’s and SF’s roster to provide a sense of nostalgia for National League fans in New York who felt betrayed when their teams moved west and would good never, in good conscience, root for their bitter rivals in the American League (i.e., the Yankees). To the fans, the Yankees were corporate-think Microsoft, Facebook, or Blackrock. In contrast, the Dodgers were the neighborhood team, the “mom and pop shop” team of Flatbush. As for the Giants, though not as “blue collar” as the Trolley Dodgers, they still had the greatest player in the last 100 years, Willie Mays. But back to that 1962 season. Colorful stories abounded about outrageous incidents that were too preposterous to be staged or fabricated. There was the Yankee’s one-time manager, Casey Stengel, summarily fired in 1960, despite guiding the Yankees to seven World Series titles in ten years. He responded, “I’ll never make the mistake of being seventy again.” The colorful Stengel was then named the first manager of the New York Mets franchise. Casey did not disappoint, although not as a strategic manager guiding a new team to unbelievable heights of winning. Instead, he just so darn colorful, providing endless anecdotes, including the fact that he sometimes Casey fell asleep on the bench. The Mets team was no better. Casey was coaching players who simply couldn’t play the game nor compete like his great Yankees teams of the 1940s and 1950s. But Casey’s honest evaluation of one of his players—“Look at that guy. He can’t hit, he can’t run, and he can’t throw. Of course, that’s why they gave him to us”—ending up causing the franchise’s to embrace rather than ostracize their players. For Casey, his players were “The Amazings,” not for their incredible play but because of the beauty, fun, and frolics they brought to each game. They lost every one of their 120 games in a unique way. It’s different with the White Sox. Notwithstanding the energy and professionalism each team member brings to the game, their inability to excite baseball is why baseball fans can’t root for them to win. It would be a shame if their boring, bland, colorless brand of losing led them to break the record and erase the “accomplishments” of baseball’s real “worst club of all time” from the record books. Or as Casey would state, “Without the losers, where would the winners be?” The ‘62 Amazings were winners...in a losing fashion. So, the Chicago White Sox looks like not just the worst team to date in the 21st century but in baseball history, too.

Title: Big three money managers cut support for climate proposals

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The three biggest US money managers slashed their support of environmental and social shareholder proposals, marking a stark turnaround from 2021, when they voted in favor of a record number of such resolutions. State Street’s investing unit said on Thursday that it supported 6% of environmental shareholder proposals in the first half of the year and 7% of social ones, less than what it did in the same year-ago period. Vanguard Group said last month that it didn’t back any of those resolutions, while BlackRock said it voted for 4% of the proposals in the 12 months ending June, down from 7% a year earlier. Together, the three money managers have immense influence during proxy season because they collectively own about 20% of the shares of all companies in the S&P 500, mainly through their enormous index-tracking funds.

On Friday, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) with a steadfast price target of $380.00. The firm's outlook remains positive as CrowdStrike introduced a comprehensive range of updates to its Falcon platform, which is anticipated to broaden its total addressable market (TAM) to $116 billion by the calendar year 2025. The firm acknowledged potential challenges, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s likely move to limit kernel level access for security vendors. Nevertheless, the firm is confident that such changes will not undermine CrowdStrike's long-term competitive position, citing the critical nature of the Falcon platform's mission. TD Cowen also addressed the issue of customer retention, noting that there have been no significant signs of client turnover following service disruptions. This observation supports the firm's belief that the forecasts for CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2026 are on the conservative side. The firm's endorsement of CrowdStrike's stock reflects confidence in the company's growth prospects and the strategic value of its product offerings. The Falcon platform's innovations are viewed as a key driver for expansion within the cybersecurity market. The $380.00 price target suggests that TD Cowen sees substantial upside potential for CrowdStrike's stock. The firm's rating and target are based on the company's strategic updates, market opportunity, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been the focus of several analyst reviews and strategic initiatives. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a Buy rating on CrowdStrike with a revised price target of $324, following the cybersecurity firm's Fal.Con 2024 conference. The company's Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) product was highlighted, contributing to more than a 65% average increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Scotiabank, Truist Securities, CapitalOne, and Piper Sandler maintained their respective ratings, reflecting confidence in CrowdStrike's growth potential despite uncertainties surrounding near-term financial projections. CrowdStrike exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter in terms of ARR, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share, although the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates. The company's management reiterated their long-term ARR goal of $10 billion by the fiscal year 2031. To achieve this, CrowdStrike launched strategic initiatives such as CrowdStrike Financial Services and established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures. These recent developments follow CrowdStrike's successful navigation through a major challenge earlier this year when a software update led to global outages. The company's crisis management skills were put to the test and subsequently showcased at their Fal.Con 2024 event. The company's ability to acquire new customers, as well as its strategies for upselling and cross-selling, are expected to be key factors influencing the company's revenue through 2025. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to innovate and expand its Falcon platform, real-time data from InvestingPro aligns with TD Cowen's optimistic view of the company's growth potential. With a robust market cap of $67.99 billion, CrowdStrike's financial health is underlined by a substantial cash position that eclipses its debt, suggesting a solid foundation for future investments and growth. Additionally, the company's impressive revenue growth of over 33% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2025 highlights its strong performance in the cybersecurity sector. InvestingPro Tips further reveal that analysts are expecting net income growth this year for CrowdStrike, which could reinforce investor confidence. While the company trades at high valuation multiples, such as a P/E ratio of 396.59 and a Price/Book ratio of 23.83, these figures reflect its high growth trajectory and market confidence in its strategic direction. Moreover, the company has demonstrated a high return over the last year, with a price total return of 62.99%, showcasing its strong market performance. For investors looking for more detailed analysis and additional tips, there are 15 more InvestingPro Tips available for CrowdStrike, providing a deeper dive into the company's financials and market position.

Title: FTC trustbuster Lina Khan: feared in boardrooms, cheered on by progressive

Time Published: 2024-09-22T23:00:29Z

Watch CBS News By Lesley Stahl September 22, 2024 / 7:00 PM EDT / CBS News Everywhere you go people are complaining about inflation: voters say it's their number one issue. Enter trustbuster Lina Khan – the youngest chair ever of the Federal Trade Commission – just 32 when she was named. She says much of the blame for the exorbitant prices on everything from food to concert tickets, is widespread corporate consolidation. The FTC's mission is breaking illegal monopolies, blocking mergers that stifle competition, and protecting consumers from a system Lina Khan says is rigged against them. But she's so aggressive that she's feared and loathed in boardrooms - seen as a zealot and a bully, and yet -- At town hall meetings around the country, Lina Khan is often swarmed by young people taking selfies, small business owners giving her cards, union members – to whom she preaches the perils of business monopolies. Lina Khan: Too often fewer and fewer companies are controlling more and more of the market. And what that means is companies can start ripping you off, hiking prices, stealing from you. She calls these events her "listening tours," that she does in both red and blue districts -- this one hosted by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowd Member: Every time I go to the supermarket, I get sticker shock. Groceries are so expensive now. What can be done to help people like me who are worried about grocery prices? Thank you. Lina Khan: The FTC is currently in court trying to block the largest grocery merger in U.S. history. Between Kroger – that owns Ralph's - and Albertsons, that owns Safeway. Together they have nearly 5,000 locations. Khan says this merger risks raising food prices even higher than they are now. Lesley Stahl: Grocery prices have gone through the roof. I believe that you think it's because of monopolies, but most economists say that it's because of supply chains caused by Covid and the Ukraine war. So which is it? Lina Khan: So there's no doubt that the pandemic and the war led prices to soar. What's been interesting is that even as some of those supply chain pressures have eased, prices have not come down concurrently as much. Lesley Stahl: So instead of inflation, are you contending that it's greedflation? That these monopolies are deliberately hiking the prices? Lina Khan: So there's a lot of discussion about what's driving the inflation and we've actually seen some executives boast on earnings calls about how inflation is great for their bottom line. Lesley Stahl: They say that? Lina Khan: They have said that publicly, yes. Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that when companies merge prices often come down, because of efficiencies, scale? Lina Khan: But even if those efficiencies arise, if the company's not checked by competition it won't have an incentive to pass those benefits on to the consumer because those consumers may not have anywhere else to go. Another consumer concern: the high cost of medicine. Pharmacist: As far as negotiating prices— Khan talks to independent pharmacists about the tricks and traps she says big pharma uses to jack up prices. For example, she zeroed in on the makers of asthma inhalers for extending their patents to keep low-cost generics off the shelves. Lesley Stahl: On these inhalers, they cost $7 in France. The same exact inhaler is around $500 in the United States. Wow. Now, something's out of whack. Lina Khan: We agree. So we took a close look at this and we found that companies were listing patents for things like the inhaler cap or the strap on your inhaler, so nothing to do with the actual ingredients of the drug or the formulation or composition of the drug. Lesley Stahl: So this is an inhaler for asthma. Show us what the innovation was that they claimed allowed them to extend the patent. Lina Khan: So it's this strap that they listed a patent for, this little piece of plastic. Lesley Stahl: No! They were saying that they should be able to continue the patent; generics can't come in for the medication, because they put that strap on-- Lina Khan: That's right-- Lesley Stahl: --to make sure you didn't lose the cap. Lina Khan: That's right. After the FTC sent warning letters to the four major inhaler makers, three of them – including this one - dropped the price from hundreds of dollars to just 35. And two days ago, the FTC filed a lawsuit to bring down the price of insulin and scores of other drugs, suing three companies the agency says are responsible for manipulating most of the prices. Lina Khan: These really fundamental things about people's daily material lives are affected by things like antitrust. But investment bankers, venture capitalists, and top CEOs say she's biased against them - that Lina Khan picks on winners because they're winners and thinks big is always bad. Lesley Stahl: Actually, Khan's doggedness represents a shift in policy, a mandate to reverse decades of a hands-off strategy toward mergers and acquisitions. It was introduced by Ronald Reagan and adopted by all presidents since, including Clinton and Obama, until President Biden put an end to it. President Biden (in 2021): We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and where-- what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Under President Biden the FTC and the Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown, suing scores of companies, including Ticketmaster, Nvidia, and the big five: Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and a court just deemed Google an illegal monopoly. It's a revolution, and the face of it is Lina Khan. Male Student: We're all law students and we love you. Female Student: Can we have a selfie? Lina Khan: Sure! Male Student: Three, two, one. Thank you. When Khan was a student here at Yale Law School, she wrote a paper called "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" contending that even though Amazon's prices are low, it's still a monopoly. Lesley Stahl: This was seen as an extraordinary breakthrough. And it went viral. Less than five years later, President Biden made her head of the agency that polices Amazon. Lesley Stahl: You know, Amazon is a very popular company. People like the convenience, the choice, the prices are pretty moderate. And they're afraid that you're gonna tamper with something that's good, that they like. Lina Khan: Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be even better off. Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Khan wins, prices will go up. Also in the FTC's crosshairs: the issue of tech giants buying up smaller companies. Lina Khan: In the technology markets we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. And some of those we realize ended up leading to significant harm. Just to give you a concrete example, there were companies that were offering Americans greater privacy and they were promising that we're not gonna use your data, we're not gonna sell it, we're not gonna spy on you everywhere all the time. After some of those firms were bought up by one of the big guys, all of those data privacy policies changed overnight. And so Americans lost those privacy protections. Lesley Stahl: You're talking about Facebook and WhatsApp? Lina Khan: Yes, that's one example of that. She's now suing over Facebook's acquisitions of Whatsapp and Instagram. Lesley Stahl: Is the mandate to reverse what's gone on for 40 years, to undo some of the mergers that were approved. Lina Khan: We've identified not just one merger, but a whole string of mergers that some of these large companies made that we believe were illegal, that we believe were anti-competitive. Lesley Stahl: But they were approved. Lina Khan: They were not blocked, they were not challenged. But the courts don't always side with her. The FTC has lost a couple of big cases against Meta and Microsoft. Yet her cage-rattling has had a chilling effect where companies simply drop their merger plans. Lina Khan: Sometimes, you know, the companies decide that they're gonna abandon the merger. Lesley Stahl: If someone just says, "I'm not going to go forward," that's a win? Lina Khan: That's right. Lesley Stahl: Obviously the companies are complaining like hell, screaming. They don't like you. They're afraid of you. Lina Khan: Well, look, we're doing our job enforcing the law-- and— Lesley Stahl: They are they're afraid you're going to tie 'em up in court, you're going to cost them a lot of money and they're saying, "It's just not worth it." Lina Khan: So it's important to step back and keep all of this in context. Of all the thousands of deals that are proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate maybe 2% or 3%. That might not sound like a lot, but start-up founders complain that she's spooking investors so much, she's actually stifling innovation. Others fear that her chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. Earlier this month, after it was reported that her counterpart at the Justice Department subpoenaed the chip maker Nvidia the stock market plunged. Lesley Stahl: Do you ever worry about the power that the FTC and the chairman have that could result in a destabilizing of basically the whole economy? Lina Khan: Of course we have to worry. But we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that can arise from companies believing that they're above the law, and that they can be reckless, take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy, and then they can get away with just a slap on the wrist. And that creates a destabilization too. Khan can be seen as a belated reaction to the financial crisis when the government decided banks were "too big to fail." But has the pendulum swung too far? Corporations are pushing back with their own lawsuits to rein her in, setting up a possible showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the FTC. Lesley Stahl: Should you be concerned that you are flirting with diminishing the muscle-- the powers that you have if the Court decides you're wrong? And this Court could very likely say you're wrong. Lina Khan: I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them. She's obviously unlikely to survive in her job if former President Trump wins, though she's admired by vice presidential nominee JD Vance – Sen. JD Vance: Well look, I don't agree with Lina Khan on every issue to be clear, but I think that she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies. She's surprisingly popular with other MAGA Republicans. Lesley Stahl: There's even a nickname for conservatives who support you. What is it? Lina Khan: I'll let you– Lesley Stahl: Khan-servatives. Khan-servatives. On the flip side, it's unclear she would keep her job if Vice President Harris wins. Lesley Stahl: Some of her biggest donors are people who want her to get rid of you. They want you off the scene. And they're not just saying it privately. They're going on television. Lina Khan: Look, you know, my focus is not listening to what CEOs are saying on TV. You know, it's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise. Lesley Stahl: If you were asked to keep this job, would you say yes? Lina Khan: Obviously, those are conversations one has with one's family and that sort of thing. But— Lesley Stahl: You don't wanna have it with me? Lina Khan: But absolutely, I mean, there's so much work to be done, and it's such an honor to be in this role. And it would be an honor to have that opportunity to keep going.

Nvidia will also support Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft has partnered with investment giant BlackRock to launch the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP), a fund exceeding $30 billion aimed at developing critical infrastructure for artificial intelligence advancements. The collaboration includes Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and MGX, and is focused on building data centers and energy projects necessary to power next-generation AI technologies. The investments will primarily target the United States, supporting the expansion of computing power and energy resources, with additional investments planned in partner countries. The partnership maintains an open architecture, granting non-exclusive access to a diverse range of companies and organizations. AI darling Nvidia will also play a role in the initiative, assisting in enhancing AI data centers. The goal of GAIIP is to unlock $30 billion in private equity capital initially, potentially reaching $100 billion when combined with debt financing. Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said, "Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity. Data centers are the bedrock of the digital economy, and these investments will help power economic growth, create jobs, and drive AI technology innovation.” GAIIP's formation comes at a time when the demand for AI infrastructure is rapidly increasing. By pooling resources from leading global investors and technology companies, the partnership aims to accelerate the development of essential infrastructure for an AI-driven future. Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft, noted that the capital required for AI infrastructure and new energy sources is more than any single company or government can finance. "This financial partnership will not only help advance technology, but enhance national competitiveness, security, and economic prosperity," he said. "Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. "Nvidia will use its expertise as a full-stack computing platform to support GAIIP and its portfolio companies on the design and integration of AI factories to propel industry innovation."

Title: Is Amazon’s RTO Mandate A Signal For Other CEOs To End Remote Work?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/09/22/is-amazons-rto-mandate-a-signal-for-other-ceos-to-end-remote-work/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T21:30:31Z
Full Content:
Many other companies are likely to follow a RTO mandate for two reasons. Slowly but surely, as the pandemic's unique circumstances fade, companies are backtracking on hybrid and remote work arrangements and rapidly restoring pre-pandemic business norms. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/22/2024 2:27:03 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called for federal employees in Washington, DC, to return to their offices, highlighting the ongoing debate over remote work policies. What Happened: Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Dimon expressed his frustration with the number of empty buildings in the capital, according to Business Insider on Friday. “By the way, I’d also make Washington, DC, go back to work. I can’t believe, when I come down here, the empty buildings. The people who work for you not going to the office,” he stated, “That bothers me,” he added. Dimon emphasized that he does not allow such flexibility at JPMorgan. Why It Matters: Dimon is not alone in his stance. Earlier this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that Amazon employees would return to the office five days a week, reverting to pre-pandemic norms. JPMorgan’s policy mandates managing directors to be in the office full-time, while other employees must work in person at least three days a week. Last year, the Biden Administration also pushed federal employees to return to in-person work. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

Opening-day statement wins abounded in the Energia All-Ireland League on Saturday, notable at Lakelands Park, where Terenure College avenged April’s defeat in the final against Cork Constitution with a 25-15 win over the champions. Playing with a strong breeze and inspired by their 21-year-old Leinster academy duo Henry McErlean and Fintan Gunne, Terenure roared into a 19-0 lead. McErlean finished of a crisp backline strike move off a lineout for their first try before Gunne struck twice. First, after Terenure winger Craig Adams fielded a goal line drop out and passed infield to Gunne on the 10-metre line, the former Irish under-20 scrumhalf chipped the advancing white line, gathered and stepped past the last man to score. Soon after he sniped down the blindside and grubber-kicked, McErlean regathering and feeding Conall Boomer. The number eight was stopped short but Gunne was on hand to score again. Con responded with lineout maul tries through Munster hooker Scott Buckley and Alessandro Heaney and dominated the second half, but Terenure held on thanks to two penalties by outhalf Aran Egan. Garryowen, who returned to Divisison 1A via the playoffs on the back of an 11-match winning run, also made their intentions clear with a thrilling 29-27 win over Lansdowne at Dooradoyle. Trailing 27-24, Garryowen opted to kick a penalty to the corner and, seven phases later, their 19-year-old Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks cross-kicked for Gordon Wood, son of Keith, to score in the corner. St Mary’s, back in the top tier after a six-year absence, led Clontarf by 24-10 early in the second half after a try by fullback Conor Hayes, but they had to settle for two bonus points after Clontarf successfully resorted to their renowned attacking game. Hooker Dylan Donnellan was back in the old routine with two tries off catch-and-drives and tries by winger Andrew Smith and a close-range finish by replacement hooker Barry Gray late on secured a 29-27 comeback win. Young Munster had a big 24-22 win in the Belfield Bowl while Ballynahinch’s 7-0 win over City of Armagh was somewhat out of keeping with the day’s trends domestically and indeed globally. Nenagh Ormond announced their arrival in 1B in front of a huge home crowd with a dominant bonus-point win over relegated Trinity, who are evidently facing another new cycle. Old Wesley and Old Belvedere had commanding home wins over Old Wesley and UCC, and Queen’s beat Shannon, while in 2A newly promoted Corinthians had a bonus-point win away to Ballymena in JJ Hanrahan’s first game as backs coach.

Title: CRWD FINAL DEADLINE: ROSEN, NATIONALLY REGARDED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important September 30 Deadline in Securities Class Action – CRWD

September 22, 2024 12:21 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: CrowdStrike (CRWD), Press Reports Ex-Employees Say “‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” Securities Class Action Pending - Hagens Berman

September 22, 2024 12:03 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

Email paydirt@dirtcheapgold.com Gold has historically been considered a strong store of value, especially during times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Over the long term, the price of gold has steadily increased, reflecting its role as a hedge against currency depreciation and market volatility. While gold may not offer the same short-term returns as stocks, it tends to retain its value over time, making it a popular choice for preserving wealth. However, like any investment, its performance can fluctuate, and it's important to consider it as part of a diversified portfolio. A stacker is someone who accumulates precious metals, like gold or silver, as a form of wealth preservation. Stackers typically prefer physical bullion such as coins or bars and focus on long-term investment strategies. The goal is often to "stack" as much metal as possible to protect against inflation or economic uncertainty. Most stackers aim to accumulate 5-10% of their net worth in metal. Stacking starts with choosing the right type of gold for your collection. Most beginners opt for popular 1 ounce coins or bars like the American Gold Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf. Make sure to buy from reputable dealers, compare premiums over spot price, and consider storage options like a safe or bank vault. Diversify your purchases over time, and be mindful of your budget, ensuring that you buy when the price aligns with your goals. The premium on gold coins and bars is the additional cost above the spot price of gold. This premium covers manufacturing, minting, distribution, and dealer costs. Coins tend to have higher premiums than bars due to their intricate designs and collectible value, whereas bars are usually closer to the spot price because they are simpler to produce. We focus on 1-ounce gold bars and coins because they are the most popular and widely traded form of gold bullion. They offer a great balance between affordability and liquidity, making them ideal for both new investors and experienced stackers. Larger bars might offer lower premiums, but 1-ounce products are more flexible when it comes to buying, selling, or trading. Costco began selling gold to members in 2023, offering 1 oz gold bars primarily through its online store. Executive members can enjoy a 2% discount, and using the Costco Anywhere Visa card adds an additional 2% cashback â a combined 4% discount that you'll receive later in the form of a rebate. These savings make Costco a competitive option for purchasing gold, though stock is often limited and sells out quickly. Costco's products don't always appear in the main list on this page, but the table below shows all of the 1 ounce gold products currently available on Costco's website. The discounted prices of these products might make them competitive with products from other sellers. Purchase from Costco or Walmart. Those sellers don't have higher prices or fees for credit cards. Storing your gold securely is crucial to protecting your investment. Many stackers choose to store their gold in a home safe, but itâs important to ensure it is fireproof and bolted down. Alternatively, you can store gold in a bank's safe deposit box or a specialized vault service, which offers additional layers of security and insurance. Whether you need to pay sales tax on gold depends on your location. In many states or countries, precious metals like gold are exempt from sales tax if purchased for investment purposes, especially above certain thresholds. Itâs important to check local tax laws to see if exemptions apply where you live. Selling gold is relatively straightforward. You can sell to local coin shops, bullion dealers, or on online platforms like r/Pmsforsale that specialize in precious metals. Itâs important to shop around for the best offer, as prices and premiums may vary. Ensure you understand any fees involved before making a transaction. The amount you can sell your gold for depends on the current spot price of gold and the type of gold you are selling. Dealers will typically offer you slightly below the spot price to cover their costs, and this is known as the buyback price. The condition and purity of your gold, as well as market demand, can also affect the price. Shop around for competitive offers, and always sell to a reputable dealer to get the best value.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth. He reaffirmed a buy rating on NFLX stock with a price target of $750. Anmuth ranks No. 99 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. (See NFLX Financials on TipRanks) Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth. He reaffirmed a buy rating on NFLX stock with a price target of $750. Anmuth ranks No. 99 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. (See NFLX Financials on TipRanks) Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, providing more insight into their recent decision to reduce interest rates. Friday's release of the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether inflation continues to slow. Investors can expect fresh data on new and pending home sales, along with an update on housing prices, and consumer sentiment surveys. Micron Technology (MU), Costco Wholesale (COST), Accenture (ACN), and more will also report earnings. Monday, Sept. 23 Tuesday, Sept. 24 Wednesday, Sept. 25 Thursday, Sept. 26 Friday, Sept. 27 Following last week’s closely watched Federal Reserve decision to enact a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, investors will hear from Fed officials this week about their impressions of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at Thursday’s 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, his first remarks since last week’s press conference. Other notable speakers will deliver remarks at the event, including New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, market watchers will likely be focused on the latest inflation data, as the August reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether price pressures continue to cool. The July PCE reading showed the Fed’s preferred inflation measurement was down to an annual rate of 2.5%, still higher than the central bank’s target. Investors will look for more progress on inflation. KB Home’s earnings report on Tuesday could also provide some insight into the health of the housing market. According to a Bank of America analysis, the Fed’s interest rate decision is likely to drive down mortgage rates and potentially improve homebuilders' performance. Memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology will report earnings Wednesday, after Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its stock, warning about the health of the memory chip market. Micron’s report comes after its prior quarter earnings were lower than analysts projected, and its revenue guidance disappointed investors. Costco’s earnings on Thursday follows its recent decision to raise membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. Analysts are expecting the retailer to report higher year-over-year revenue and profit, with memberships rising to 75 million.

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! What happened? On Monday, Mizuho downgraded Southern Company (NYSE:SO) to Neutral with a $90 price target. *TLDR: Mizuho sees limited catalysts for further outperformance despite a 21% P/E premium. Strong load growth and robust capital plan should support SO’s 5-7% EPS growth rate and maintain a strong balance sheet through 2026. What’s the full story? Mizuho downgraded Southern Company to Neutral, after previously upgrading it in April 2023 when shares were trading at a 4% P/E premium to the group. The firm initially argued that shares could re-rate to a double-digit premium as Vogtle Unit 4 neared completion. However, with shares now trading at a 21% P/E premium to the electric utility group, Mizuho sees few catalysts for further outperformance. Despite moving to the sidelines on SO, Mizuho believes that strong load growth in SO’s service territory, driven by data center demand and reshoring of manufacturing, should make the company’s 5-7% EPS growth rate more durable. The firm also believes that management can maintain a robust capital plan, a strong balance sheet with 17% FFO/Debt, and minimal equity needs of $350 million per year through 2026. Neutral at Mizuho means “The stock’s total return is expected to perform in line with the unweighted, expected total return of the analyst’s industry coverage universe over the next 12 months. “ What happened? On Tuesday, Redburn-Atlantic upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to Buy with a $99 price target *TLDR: Redburn-Atlantic highlights Shopify’s innovation, social media integrations, and Shop Pay as key growth factors. The firm is forecasting 29% revenue CAGR and 40% EBIT margin by 2026. What’s the full story? Redburn-Atlantic highlights Shopify’s industry-leading innovation, social media integrations, user-friendly platform, and unique Shop Pay button functionality as key factors positioning it to capitalize on structural growth. The firm’s extensive ecosystem and platform capabilities have cemented Shopify as the ecommerce provider of choice for merchants of all sizes, with significant enterprise merchant wins anticipated in 2025. Redburn-Atlantic upgrades its recommendation on Shopify to Buy, citing the company’s multi-faceted moat characterized by scale, high switching costs, and an impenetrable three-sided network. The firm forecasts a 29% net revenue CAGR from 2023-26 and a 40% EBIT margin by 2026, resulting in projections 24% above 2026 EBIT consensus. The price target is set at $99, based on above-consensus earnings and a fair multiple in line with peers in the internet, fintech, and software sectors. Buy at Redburn-Atlantic means “Redburn Atlantic argues that the stock price will rise by at least 15% over one year. For high beta stocks the hurdle rate may be commensurately higher. “ What happened? On Wednesday, Wolfe Research downgraded ResMed Inc (NYSE:RMD) to Underperform with a $180 price target. *TLDR: Wolfe rates RMD Underperform with a $180 target, citing disruption risks from Lilly’s GLP-1 medication. Analysts see 10% upside and 30%-40% downside risk, projecting mid-single digit growth. What’s the full story? Wolfe analysts rate RMD shares as Underperform with a $180 target price, applying a 20x P/E multiple to NTM EPS of roughly $9. This lower multiple reflects anticipated disruption risks to RMD’s business in 2025-2026 due to Lilly’s potential launch of an obstructive sleep apnea indication for its GLP-1 medication tirzepatide. Wolfe’s total addressable market analysis suggests a 15%-25% long-term impact on the CPAP opportunity, leading to a sustainable growth rate more likely in the mid-single digits rather than high-single digits. The analysts present two comparison sets: HSD med tech growers with a 25x-27.5x P/E and MSD med tech growers with a 15x-20x P/E. They believe RMD’s growth expectations align more with the upper end of the MSD range. A doctor survey projects a negative 6% impact on CPAP prescription volumes, framing the potential shift from HSD to MSD growth. Wolfe sees a 10% upside potential with a 30%-40% downside risk over the next 12-24 months. Underperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to underperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.” What happened? On Thursday, BTIG upgraded DoorDash Inc (NASDAQ:DASH) to Buy with a $155 price target. *TLDR: BTIG raises estimates for DASH due to near-term strength and long-term growth drivers. Positive EBIT and net income expected in 2H; rideshare-delivery sector shows secular growth. What’s the full story? BTIG has been closely monitoring DoorDash due to a positive category bias, strong execution, and upward pressure on estimates. The analyst highlights three key reasons for raising estimates: ongoing near-term strength and under-appreciated long-term drivers, important milestones with positive EBIT and net income expected in the second half, and the rideshare-delivery sector being a rare area of secular growth in consumer-facing Internet. The analyst emphasizes the desire to increase exposure to DASH relative to more mature categories like eTravel, online dating, and real estate services. BTIG sees significant potential in DASH’s continued growth and milestones, positioning it as a compelling investment opportunity. Buy at BTIG means “A security which is expected to produce a positive total return of 15% or greater over the 12 months following the recommendation. The BUY rating may be maintained as long as it is deemed appropriate, notwithstanding price fluctuations that would cause the target to fall outside of the 15% return. “ What happened? On Friday, B. Riley initiated coverage on Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) at Buy with a $75 price target. *TLDR: B. Riley sees Reddit’s unique platform and early monetization phase driving growth. Attractive risk/reward profile at 31x 2025 EBITDA, with potential for significant leverage. What’s the full story? B. Riley highlights Reddit’s unique value proposition to users, advertisers, and content licensees through its platform, which supports tens of millions of users across over 100,000 communities. This creates a vast and growing repository of curated content. The broker believes Reddit is in the early stages of monetizing its platform through advertising and data licensing, positioning it for healthy top-line growth and margin gains in the coming years. At approximately 31x 2025 estimated EBITDA, B. Riley finds the risk/reward profile attractive, given the prospects for above-industry growth and significant leverage over the next several years. The broker sees Reddit’s potential for continued expansion and profitability as a compelling investment opportunity Buy at B. Riley means “We generally expect “Buy” rated stocks to have an above-average risk-adjusted total return over the next 12 months. We recommend that investors buy the securities at the current valuation."

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SK Hynix hit by double downgrade; ADI named Top Semis Pick

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! During the week, William Blair analysts have initiated coverage on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) with an Outperform rating, voicing confidence in the company’s potential for strong earnings per share (EPS) growth and stock price appreciation over the coming years. The firm pointed to several growth drivers for Arm, including “1) higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) driven by improved monetization and higher value IP; 2) share gains in newer markets like data center; 3) tailwinds from AI driving higher demand for overall compute; and 4) a new upgrade cycle in mobile/PCs.” While Arm’s stock trades at a premium compared to its peers, William Blair believes this is justified by the company’s robust growth outlook, which is expected to become clearer in the financial forecasts for 2026 and 2027. Their discounted cash flow analysis indicates around 35% upside potential for Arm’s shares, supported by sustained revenue growth and increasing profitability over the next decade. In a separate note, William Blair also assigned an Outperform rating to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), noting the company's strategic expansion into software as a way to buffer against the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The firm believes that the chipmaker is positioned for continued growth, driven by AI-related demand in networking and custom chip segments, along with the shift to subscription-based models in its VMware (NYSE:VMW) division. Analysts highlighted that nearly two-thirds of VMware customers have transitioned to subscriptions, a significant rise from the 30% seen prior to the acquisition. They also noted that AVGO is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26x and an enterprise value to free cash flow ratio of 22x based on their 2025 projections, slightly below the median of its peers. “We see room for multiple expansion as the sustainability of growth in networking, customer AI chips, and software becomes clearer,” the note states. Shares of SK Hynix (KS:000660) dropped on Thursday following a double downgrade from Morgan Stanley, with analysts shifting their rating from Overweight to Underweight. In a note, analysts remarked that "the sun is still shining" for the company at the moment. They predict 2024 will be another strong year for SK Hynix, driven by increasing DRAM prices heading into the fourth quarter, which should lead to "exceptional near-term earnings." However, the outlook beyond the fourth quarter appears less favorable. While the long-term potential for DRAM, particularly due to AI-driven demand from data centers, is still promising, the firm noted that cyclical shortages are coming to an end. “Looking past 4Q24, we see sustained risks to the top line and EPS as growth slows, pricing falls, and rising competition in high-bandwith memory (HBM) challenges sustainable long-term margins,” the analysts added. In addition to downgrading the stock, Morgan Stanley also cut its price target for SK Hynix by more than half, lowering it from 260,000 to 120,000 Korean won. In a research note released Tuesday, Citi analysts named Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) as their new top pick in the semiconductor sector. The decision follows Citi's update to its semiconductor stock ranking table, which included a price target adjustment for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and an upgrade of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The firm maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor industry as a whole. Citi highlighted ADI's lower downside risk in the automotive sector compared to other analog semiconductor makers, particularly following the company’s recent earnings report. This reduced risk, according to Citi, makes ADI well-positioned amid ongoing market uncertainties, leading the firm to rank it at the top of its semiconductor stock table. "ADI is our top pick," Citi analysts stated, adding that they see "lower downside risk in Autos versus other analog names given they have just announced earnings." Broadcom and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both key players in the AI sector, remain in Citi's second and third spots, respectively. Wedbush analysts said that they believe the AI revolution trade has gained momentum following the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut, signaling a favorable environment for Big Tech and AI stocks. Wedbush views this aggressive rate cut, alongside a dovish dot plot extending into 2025, as creating a "very bullish backdrop" for the tech sector. The Fed’s move marks a momentous shift, as many investors had been waiting for this signal to fully engage with tech growth stocks leading into 2025. The firm pointed out that the broader technology sector has remained resilient, with recent earnings reports, such as those from Oracle, indicating that the AI revolution is entering its software and application phase. Recent observations from Asia suggest the tech supply chain is preparing for significant expansion, spurred by an expected $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures in the coming years. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains at the forefront of this revolution, with its GPUs being described by Wedbush as the "new oil and gold" of the IT industry. With the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting cycle now underway and AI tech spending beginning to accelerate, Wedbush analysts continue to hold a bullish outlook for tech stocks, expecting further gains into 2025. Meanwhile, analysts at Melius Research have upgraded Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) from Hold to Buy, setting a price target of $210. They emphasize that Oracle founder Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz are not only leveraging their influence but also taking a more strategic approach with partnerships, positioning Oracle’s AI-first Cloud as a key growth driver. Ellison’s strong connections in the tech world, including access to GPUs and agreements with Cloud CEOs, along with his friendship with customer Elon Musk, have played a role, Melius’s team notes. While Oracle’s stock is up 54% year-to-date, the firm’s analysts believe this upgrade might not be late, suggesting the stock could be in the middle of a larger move. "We see close to $8.50 in terms of an EPS run rate within 2 years—and with our biggest worries muted—we find it hard not to put a 25x multiple on a company set to grow faster than Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)," they said.

September 21, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Indivior class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/INDV CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share. For more information on the DXC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DXC Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: Elon Musk's X is the least-trusted Big Tech company, according to a survey — on par with the US government
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-x-sentiment-trust-big-tech-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-21T18:18:15Z

Americans think Elon Musk's X is as trustworthy as the US government. And that's not a compliment. A May survey published by All About Cookies, a company promoting digital security and online privacy, asked 1,000 US adults how much they trusted Big Tech and media companies compared to their government. EMARKETER, a market research company owned by Business Insider's parent company, shared the survey data on Friday. While companies like Amazon and Google topped the list, Musk's platform came in dead last. The survey's data showed that 70% of respondents trust Amazon, 65% trust Google, and 64% trust Netflix. Only 29% trusted TikTok, which ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns. US officials worry that ByteDance shares data with the Chinese government and have demanded it divest TikTok to an American-owned company or face a nationwide ban. Even fewer — only 28% of respondents — however, trusted X, the same percentage that trusted the US government. The survey showed that 43% of respondents distrusted the US government, while 44% distrusted X. Although the survey didn't clarify why respondents ranked X last on the list, the platform has been a magnet for controversy since Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, rebranded it, and overhauled how it moderates content. Musk conducted mass layoffs after taking control of Twitter, particularly among its trust and safety team, whose numbers dwindled from about 230 employees to about 20. More trust and safety staffers were laid off the following year. Yoel Roth, once the head of the trust and safety team, resigned from the company soon after Musk's arrival. Concerns about misinformation on the social media app grew quickly after Musk's purchase, so he launched Community Notes in 2022. A 2023 Bloomberg report said it analyzed almost 400 X posts that contained false information about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, however, and found that it typically took more than seven hours for a Community Note to appear, and some took 70 hours. Musk himself has faced backlash for his own questionable posts, including in 2023 when business leaders criticized him for amplifying an antisemitic post on X. He backtracked in January during a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association, saying he was "naive" about antisemitism and is "Jewish by association." Musk is now dealing with the fallout from another X post this month after former President Donald Trump survived a second apparent assassination attempt. Musk asked in the post why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris haven't also faced similar threats. Musk's post immediately drew backlash for promoting political violence, prompting him to delete it and defend himself, calling it a "joke." The US Secret Service told Bloomberg News it is "aware" of Musk's post and is investigating the matter. Musk's X has also run afoul of multiple foreign governments, most recently in Brazil, where X lawyers on Friday finally capitulated to demands for stricter content moderation months after the country's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban of the platform. Representatives for X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

September 21, 2024 07:16 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company.

Full Content:
Micron Technology (MU) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner to swing to a profit. The Street expects the company to report net income of $975.41 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $1.43 billion a year earlier. Revenue is projected to nearly double to $7.66 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Micron has grappled with growing inventories, and Citi analysts recently lowered their price target for the stock to $150 from $175, citing its high inventory and weakness in demand for legacy memory components. However, the analysts said inventory buildup could ease by the end of the year, adding they "expect Micron’s revenue and gross margins to increase for the next several quarters." The analyst consensus for Micron’s fiscal first quarter of 2025 is revenue of $8.4 billion and EPS of $1.45, according to Visible Alpha. Morgan Stanley analysts also lowered their price target for Micron to $100 from $140 ahead of the company's earnings report, pointing to high inventories and signs of "persistently weak demand across all end markets except AI." Micron could see demand improve next year, the analysts said, fueled by "an AI-driven upgrade cycle for edge devices, continued strength in datacenters, and the potential for a traditional server refresh." Micron shares rose close to 2% to $90.90 Friday and have gained about 6.5% since the start of the year.

Pornpimone Audkamkong/Getty Images W hat makes a growth stock? The first thing most investors look at is the earnings per share. But there’s a case to be made for giving equal attention to revenue growth. More precisely, you want companies whose revenue per share figure is growing at an impressive exponential rate. Winners on this score include such Wall Street favorites as Tesla, Block (the parent company of the Square payment network) and Meta Platforms (Facebook, that is). Ahead of them in the rankings are some less familiar names: Cheniere Energy, which exports liquified natural gas; Alnylam, a money-losing but very promising developer of RNA-based medicines, and MercadoLibre, a Latin American e-commerce platform whose shares see heavy trading on Nasdaq. Some smart investors have zeroed in on the top lines of companies. One was Charles Allmon (1921 – 2015), whose long-running Growth Stock Outlook newsletter included half a dozen stocks that appreciated more than 10,000% while on the recommended list. In an interview with Forbes on the occasion of his retirement at age 87, Allmon explained his philosophy. "In the long run a company cannot grow any faster than its sales," he said. "I look at sales first, earnings second and balance sheet third." Yes, earning growth matters a lot, and it’s scored in our review of earnings growers (see story list at bottom). But here we consider only revenue, not what companies get out of it. The sorting is by growth in revenue per share, since a boost in revenue made possible by a dilution of the share base doesn’t do much good for investors. Example: International Flavors & Fragrances, which makes chemicals for food and perfume aromas, looks pretty good in total revenue, better than tripling it over the past decade. But it has tripled its share count in that period. Its revenue per share growth comes in at an unimpressive 3% a year. Contrast that to Oracle Corporation, which sells software to maintain corporate databases. It is using its fount of profits to reduce the share count with buybacks. Thus, while Oracle’s total revenue has been growing at only a 3% rate, its revenue per share has been growing 10%. The analysis starts with 1,614 companies in the FactSet database that trade in the U.S., have market capitalizations over $1 billion and show revenue and shares outstanding numbers for at least 10 of the 12 years 2013-2024 (the last being a forecast). The long-term growth number is what comes out of an exponential fit to the revenue per share history. Predictability measures how closely that history tracks an exponential line (the statistician’s coefficient of determination), with a penalty for missing years. The top 10% of the group in predictability get the “Very High” label, the next 15% “High,” the next 15% “Above Average.” Among big companies with “Above Average” or better predictability, here are 20 standouts, with revenue per share growth between 22% and 58%: Not quite squeaking in are two names you expect to see: Amazon.com and Alphabet (i.e., Google). They both make the second ranking, however. This roster is limited to big companies with growth rates above 18% and Very High predictability: The final list is an assortment of revenue disappointments. It includes a woebegone utility (the former Pacific Gas & Electric), a good company in a shrinking industry (Artisan Partners, active management), a telephone company that wasn’t sure about diversifying into content (AT&T) and two greater-fool speculations (GameStop and AMC Entertainment). The revenue and share count statistics used as inputs come from FactSet, the price/earnings ratios from YCharts. Conclusions about growth rates are the author’s. The calculation uses a share count estimate for December 2024 that is an extrapolation of the recent trend in shares outstanding.

Title: Cory Doctorow at DEFCON: Disenshittify or Die

Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Cory Doctorow, a renowned science fiction author and journalist, gave an enthralling speech at the recently concluded DEF CON. titled ‘DISENSHITTIFY OR DIE’. The word enshittification may seem alien to most people and it probably can’t be contained in a simpler definition. It is an entire process of exploiting end-users through a series of steps. Consider this: when the Internet first came into existence, the platforms were very simple. But is it the same now? A big NO, take Microsoft for example. Now, they allow you to use apps on the cloud, and track the features that are most important to you. They then take those features out of the basic package and sell them to you separately. This is called enshittification. The first step of this enshittification process starts with businesses appearing to be good to their end users. For example, Facebook shows you what you want to see, Uber charges less for cabs, and Amazon subsidizes goods and returns, and puts the best match of products at the top of the search results. However, there’s a hidden, more sinister part of stage one – locking in users. Now, there are several ways a platform can lock users in. Apple parts also use parts pairing, which is DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main device, so that you cannot use third-party parts to fix a broken device. Plus, every part of the device has a microscopic Apple logo, so third-party parts are subject to trademark violation. Once businesses have locked users in, they start making things worse for users and better for themselves. For instance, platforms poison their search results with ads. Let’s take Amazon for example, who sells its search results, making $38 billion every year. And this costs a ton of money for businesses. Around 45% of the price of these products goes to Amazon. As a result, businesses have to increase the prices to make up for the lost margin. But that’s not the end. Amazon has a policy called the ‘Most Favoured Nation Status’ which means that the cheapest price they offer must be matched on Amazon. So what’s the solution? Businesses raise their prices everywhere – Target, Walmart, and your local shops. Similarly, Facebook poisons your feed too. It shows you less of the content from the people you follow and more of sponsored content and boosted posts. There’s an old adage that says “If you’re not paying for the product, then you’re the product”. However, Cory does not agree with this. Apple once offered a one-click option to opt out of app-based surveillance and 96% opted out. But now. Apple has turned on iOS spying, which collects users’ data for ad targeting with no option to opt out. So, even after paying $1,000 for the phone, you’re still the product. The same goes for Facebook’s ad business. This is the phase where businesses suck out all the utility from their products leaving users trapped. They do so through twiddling. With this, businesses alter the service backend to change its operations, costs, prices, search ranking, and other foundation aspects of the system. Digital platforms have made twiddling very easy. The same goes for YouTube videos. After spending thousands of dollars on a video, it is the algorithm that decides who watches them. In many cases, these videos don’t even reach the subscribers. However, there are some upsides to twiddling as well. Forbes’ Emily Baker White revealed that TikTok has a feature called the heating tool. When applied to a user’s account, this tool boosts videos from that particular creator, which reaches millions of users, irrespective of the recommendation algorithm. But why does TikTok do this? Let’s say TikTok wants more sports content on its platform. They randomly pick an account and heat it up so that the content gets a lot of traction. When other creators see this, they think that sports content is in trend and they start making similar content. And quite naturally, they do not get the traction similar to the first creator and they end up thinking that they’re missing something and doing TikTok wrong. The same thing goes for Uber drivers making $100,000 a year, sub-stackers rolling in dough, or Joe Rogan’s Spotify payout. The reason is pretty simple – the less value a business gives to suppliers, customers, and workers, the more value is left to be divided between the shareholders and executives. But, the real question is why NOW? Earlier there were consequences to enshittification. For example, companies like MySpace and Yahoo Search are down in the dumps, since they enshittified their products way too early. But now, there are no consequences of enshittification. Let’s explain the lack of consequences. There are four forces that discipline tech companies: Your customers should not find it easy to leave you and switch to a rival product. For example, the network effect of Facebook has prevented its users from leaving. But the main question is whether there’s an alternative. Similarly, Apple, Microsoft, and Google aren’t making things companies but buying them, which has led to a monopolistic market economy. This, in turn, has been made possible due to the government’s unexplained tolerance towards anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, predatory pricing, and market-distorting exclusivity deals, which are prohibited by antitrust laws. This has made companies too big to fail, which in turn, has made them too big to care. And once companies realize that you’ve nowhere to go and no alternative in sight, they start treating you badly. When the government stopped caring about antitrust laws, they killed all hopes of regulation. Regulation is only meaningful when the regulator is more powerful than the companies it regulates. When the companies become bigger than the government, it becomes almost impossible to regulate them, irrespective of their crimes. And this hefty risk paid off for IBM when Ronald Reagan became the President. Regan believed in a monopoly-driven economy and dropped the case on IBM. Let’s take the example of an industry where there are 100 companies, each fighting for a share of the market. These businesses are too busy thinking about snatching the food off others’ plates and poaching employees and customers. Now imagine these 100 companies merging into five giant corporations, which basically become a ‘cartel’. Now, getting a consensus becomes easier and so does capturing the regulators. This has given them the power to escape privacy or labor rights, just because they do it with an app. For example, spying on your phone activities doesn’t seem to be a privacy violation to businesses just because they do so with an app. The same goes for algorithmic wage violations. So once the competition was killed and cartels overtook regulators, there was still something that could be done – disenshittification. In the tech field, every enshittificatory alteration can be disenshittified. So, every time HP sells you expensive ink, it is inviting a third-party seller to sell a refill kit. Or when Tesla installs codes that do not let you charge your whole battery, it is inviting a competitor to sell you a jailbreaking kit. Once the customer finds ways to disenshittify the enshittified product, that customer is lost forever. This is exactly how interoperability works and is a major check on enshittification. Tech workers have always been in short supply, which gives them an upper hand. And to make these workers work crazy hours, businesses came up with a trick – vocational awe. Businesses appealed to their love for technology and managed to convince them that they were the heroes of the digital transformation. This whole vocation awe worked for a while – employees did put in some hard hours. But, it also backfired for businesses. Since the supply was still short, there was always another employer ready to pay them just as much. But eventually, supply caught up with the demand. Last year, 260,000 tech workers were fired and the businesses gained the upper hand. Businesses and bosses have always been like this. They want to charge hefty prices, while delivering the least value and share as little as possible with workers, users, suppliers, and customers. However, earlier when they tried to enshittify their business, constraints like competition, regulation, interop, and workers stopped them. But now, when all these forces have melted away, the enshittification lever is free to move. During the end of this speech, Cory called for the formation of a new good internet. But for that, the four constraints should be reinstated. The first constraint is competition. After almost 40 years of lull, antitrust is finally coming back. For example, Wiz refused to be merged with Google, which was supposed to be the largest merger in history.. New merger guidelines are being rolled out by the FTC and the DoJ. Countries like the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea are taking more antitrust action in the last 4 years than they did during the past 40 years. The EU passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires a dominant platform to open up APIs so that third-party businesses can offer interoperable services. But that’s not the case with the DMA, it is called an ‘Act’, which means it is enforced in the EU’s federal courts and not Ireland. Even US lawmakers are working towards creating new privacy laws. There has been a movement called the Right to Repair led by the Repair Coalition. In fact, in Oregon, a state R2R bill has been passed that bans parts pairing, where DRMs prevented using new parts unless it was authorized by a technician code. Tech workers were for long made to believe that they were ‘entrepreneurs in making’. But the reality was that workers’ power was because of scarcity and when that ended, layoffs started, and workers lost their edge. The solution is simple – union.

The proposed funding round, amounting to $6.5 billion, is reportedly attracting strong interest from both existing and new investors, including tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In related developments, Nvidia's significant stock rally has been a major contributor to the S&P 500's performance, with the chipmaker's shares marking a 140% increase this year. The surge came after Nvidia's CEO announced robust demand for the company's chips. In the banking sector, companies like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America, and Wells Fargo saw their shares increase after reducing their prime rates. This followed the Federal Reserve's recent announcement of a half a percentage point cut to support the world's largest economy. Market participants are now anticipating a further 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's November meeting. These recent developments highlight the dynamic nature of the investment landscape, with companies like OpenAI and Nvidia making significant strides in their respective sectors.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the final day of a trading week that saw the financial headlines dominated by the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting. A day after notching an all-time closing high in the wake of the Fed's decision to lower interest rates, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Friday. After wavering for much of the session, the Dow rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of less than 0.1%, eking out its second straight record close. The Nasdaq ended Friday's session 0.4% lower. FedEx (FDX) shares plummeted 15.2%, the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock, after the package delivery giant reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and trimmed its full-year forecasts. The company cited soft demand trends, especially in U.S. markets. Following the earnings release, analysts at the investment bank Jefferies reduced their price target on FedEx stock. Lennar (LEN) topped sales and profit estimates with its fiscal third-quarter results, but shares of the homebuilder fell 5.4% after it predicted its gross margin on home sales would remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Friday's downdraft reversed the gains posted by Lennar stock in the previous session following the Fed's rate-cut announcement. Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) also gave back the gains they notched after the Fed's decision, dropping 5.2% on Friday. The less-than-truckload (LTL) freight company is navigating numerous headwinds, with shipment volumes and rates coming under pressure amid soft freight demand, increasing capital expenditures and a shortage of drivers. Electric utility Constellation Energy (CEG) announced plans to restart operations at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide environmentally friendly energy for Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. Constellation said it inked a 20-year deal with the software giant to create the Crane Clean Energy Center, generating carbon-free electricity to power Microsoft's data centers on the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland power transmission system. Constellation Energy shares soared 22.3% on Friday, notching the top performance in the S&P 500. Constellation's announcement also helped lift shares of other electricity generators, including those of power utility Vistra (VST), which jumped 16.6%. Vistra also announced it will acquire the remaining 15% stake that it does not currently own in its subsidiary Vistra Vision, which includes nuclear, solar, and energy storage assets. Meanwhile, shares of fellow Texas-based power generator NRG Energy (NRG) added 6.4%. Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) gained 8.1% following positive comments from analysts at Citigroup. The cybersecurity firm drew negative attention in July when a faulty update of its security software caused widespread technology outages worldwide. However, analysts applauded transparency from the company's management team following the incident. Citi also pointed to CrowdStrike's success in limiting customer churn and maintaining pricing.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Costco Earnings Thursday

Full Content:
Costco Wholesale (COST) reports fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, the warehouse retailer's first report since raising its membership price for the first time in seven years. Costco is projected to report $2.26 billion in net income on just shy of $80 billion in revenue, up from $2.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively, a year earlier, according to consensus estimates of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Costco's leadership has signaled plans to catch up to rivals who have a larger share of digital sales, as the retailer has lagged in online shopping, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote earlier this month. In last quarter's earnings call, Costco leadership said e-commerce sales grew more than 20% year-over-year as the company has sought to improve its website and app shopping experiences. Costco has worked to make its app faster, and added features like searching the inventory of a nearby warehouse to see if it has a particular item in stock. Morgan Stanley analysts recently raised their price target for Costco shares to $950 from $855, calling it "among the best compounding growth stories in retail," and said they believe Costco's next decade could see digital growth and comparable store sales grow at a higher rate than it averaged before the pandemic. Costco announced in July that it would raise its membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. The changes won't have an impact on fourth-quarter earnings, but executives may get asked on the earnings call about if they've seen any changes in signups or renewals since the new prices were implemented. The retailer is projected to reach 75 million members in the quarter, up from 71 million a year ago and 74.5 million members in Q3. Costco shares finished Friday just below $907 a share, below its record high above $923 set last month. The shares are up nearly 40% this year.

On Friday, HSBC adjusted its stance on FedEx (NYSE:FDX), shifting the rating from Buy to Hold and lowering the price target to $300 from the previous $350. The decision was influenced by revised earnings expectations, with the firm's forecast for fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP EBIT dropping by 8% to $6.8 billion. This figure falls 3% short of the company's guidance midpoint of $7.0 billion and is 4% below the consensus. The analyst from HSBC highlighted a decrease in projected volumes and yields as the primary reasons for the downgrade. Alongside the EBIT revision, the firm's forecast for non-GAAP EPS for fiscal year 2025 was also reduced by 6% to $20.09, which is 2% below the midpoint of guidance and consensus estimates. The target price adjustment reflects a lower target PE multiple of 15.1x, down from 16.6x. FedEx's stock performance was part of the evaluation, with a notable 21% rally year-to-date, mirroring the S&P 500's performance but outperforming its competitors. UPS's shares fell by 13%, and DHL's by 7% in the same period. The analyst pointed out that over the past two years, FedEx's share price has nearly doubled, increasing by 92.5% compared to a 20% decline for UPS and a 51% increase for the S&P 500. This surge in FedEx's stock was attributed to the success of its restructuring plan, which the analyst believes is now largely factored into the current share price. In other recent news, FedEx has experienced a series of adjustments following its first-quarter financial results for fiscal year 2025. The delivery giant reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60, falling short of market expectations due to a shift in the types of shipments it handled. Despite these challenges, FedEx management has maintained a positive outlook, citing cost-saving measures and revenue management initiatives expected to increase sequentially throughout the year. Raymond James reduced its price target for FedEx to $310, while maintaining an Outperform rating, citing ongoing strategic initiatives such as the DRIVE program. TD Cowen reduced its price target to $328, but maintained a Buy rating, reflecting cautious optimism about FedEx's long-term potential. Jefferies, on the other hand, reduced its price target to $275, maintaining a Hold rating due to weaker than anticipated margins. Susquehanna lowered its price target for FedEx to $330, but maintained a Positive rating, expressing optimism for the company's potential rebound. Stifel also adjusted its price target for FedEx to $321, retaining a Buy rating despite the company's underperformance. As FedEx (NYSE:FDX) navigates through a period of recalibrated expectations, it's essential to consider the broader financial landscape and performance indicators that InvestingPro offers. The company boasts a market capitalization of $73.58 billion and trades at a P/E ratio of 17.26, which is noteworthy given the recent analyst downgrades and the high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth. Despite the downward revisions, FedEx has a strong track record of maintaining dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, with a dividend yield of 1.85% as of the last twelve months leading up to Q4 2024. InvestingPro Tips highlight that FedEx has raised its dividend for three consecutive years and analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year, reinforcing its status as a prominent player in the Air Freight & Logistics industry.

Title: Novo Nordisk Sinks on Obesity Drug Study's Disappointing Results

Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Friday after a study of the pharmaceutical firm’s latest obesity treatment showed less effectiveness in higher doses. The company said a Phase 2a trial of the drug monlunabant found patients with a baseline weight of 110.1 kilograms (242.7 pounds) taking 10 milligrams once a day for 16 weeks achieved a drop of 7.1 kilograms (15.7 pounds), versus 0.7 kilograms (1.5 pounds) for those given a placebo. Increasing the dosage, however, produced “limited additional weight loss.” Novo Nordisk also said that mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, “were more frequent and dose dependent" when compared to placebos. Novo Nordisk said it would be initiating a larger Phase 2b study next year “to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant.” The company is a leader in the weight-loss medicine category, with the booming popularity of its Wegovy and Ozempic injectables. However, it has received criticism over the high price of the drugs, and a Novo Nordisk executive reportedly said earlier this week that Ozempic is “very likely” to be targeted by the U.S. government for a price cut for Medicare recipients. Novo Nordisk shares were down over 5% in intraday trading Friday, though even with Friday's losses, they've gained more than 22% since the start of the year.

Title: Rates to plunge to 2.75pc next year, says HSBC
URL: https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rates-plunge-2-75pc-next-172625383.html

The Bank of England could cut interest rates to 2.75pc next year, analysts have suggested, amid growing confidence that the worst of Britain’s inflationary crisis is over. Policymakers are likely to cut interest rates at November’s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and then again at every meeting next year from February, according to analysts from HSBC. It follows a decision by the Bank of England’s MPC earlier this week to keep rates on hold at 5pc. The Bank Rate had surged as high as 5.25pc following a series of rises over the past few years to try keep a lid on inflation. Last month, the Bank of England cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The analysts at HSBC said: “Part of the slightly better medium-term growth outlook reflects monetary policy. “With most indicators pointing to a cooling in the labour market, we and BoE have become more confident that the worst of the inflation pressures - and the risk of them becoming entrenched - is behind us. Given this, the current policy rate looks some way above neutral.” They said the latest statement from the Monetary Policy Committee suggested that rate setters were not in “the mood to move quickly”. However, the analysts said: “Given our own forecast that CPI inflation will rise back to 2.9pc by January next year (perhaps a touch above the Bank of England’s expectation), it might be February before the MPC has sufficient confidence for back-to-back rate cuts taking Bank Rate to 2.75pc in December next year.” HSBC suggested rates would then remain on hold throughout 2026. Read the latest updates below. Thanks for joining us today. The Markets blog will be back on Monday morning, but you can keep up to date over the weekend with business news and analysis from The Telegraph here. Christine Lagarde has said she was “shocked” by Germans’ enthusiastic use of cash when she moved to Frankfurt to head the European Central Bank. Tim Wallace reports: “I was shocked when I moved to Frankfurt to see how much was paid in banknotes. You had better have a big wallet, because a lot is paid in banknotes,” she said. “The citizens are attached to banknotes. You go to Sweden or to the Netherlands and you can hardly pay with a banknote - they send you off, bring your phone, don’t you have another way to pay?” The ECB President is looking into creating a central bank digital currency, but said citizens are worried about the privacy of the system. “The main concern people have is privacy - Big Brother is going to see where I spend my money,” she told an audience at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. “You know what, there are a few Big Brothers when you use your bank account or when you use other devices who know where you are spending your money, know what you are interested in and will send you instantly all those ads and nice proposals. “But the concern about the state - the assumption is the central bank will communicate all information collected to the state - will be privy to how you spend your money is something that is very very critical for citizens.” In her lecture to the IMF, Ms Lagarde warned that the inflation shock may not be a one-off. “If we enter an era where inflation is more volatile and monetary policy transmission more uncertain, maintaining this deep anchor for price formation will be essential,” she said, referring to the expectation among households and businesses that central banks will always raise interest rates to crush inflation. She also compared the 2020s to the 1920s, citing similarities including pandemics, a reversal of globalisation, and rapid technological progress. But she also raised the hope that central banks have learned their lesson from that era and should be able to avoid the “series of wrong turns” which tipped much of the world into the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve’s big interest rate cut this week is not a sign that the US economy is “falling behind,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in an interview this afternoon. He told CNBC: It’s not about reacting to, or falling behind or anything like that. I do not believe we’re behind. Mr Waller was responding to arguments that the central bank should not do a half percentage point rate cut - instead opting for a smaller reduction - as this would be a sign of economic weakness. Citing a speech he made earlier this year, Mr Waller stressed that the Fed could cut rates even if the economy was doing fine. “And that’s the position we’re in,” he said, noting that inflation is cooling while the labour market remains solid. Central banks face a “difficult balancing act” as they start lowering interest rates around the world in the face of falling inflation, the head of the IMF said at an event this afternoon. Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have cut rates this year, with the US Federal Reserve reducing its key lending rate by half a percentage point earlier this week in a bid to boost demand, following in the footsteps of the European Central Bank (ECB). But as they do so they must tread carefully, International Monetary Fund boss Kristalina Georgieva said at an event with ECB president Christine Lagarde in Washington. Ms Georgieva said: Central banks face a difficult balancing act. They must ensure that inflation sustainably returns to target and remains there, while avoiding the risk of excessively tight policies. While clearly weaker than we would have wanted, economic activity has been remarkably resilient, While inflation is retreating, rates are going down. Recession appears to be unlikely. The ECB has cut rates twice this year, while the Bank of England voted on Thursday to leave rates unchanged after just one cut, as UK inflation remained above-target. Ms Lagarde said that the ECB’s “determined policy actions have successfully kept inflation expectations anchored,” adding that inflation remains on track to hit its two percent target in the middle of next year. “But is the uncertainty gone? No, there is still plenty of that around,” she said. Gold hit an all-time high this afternoon but stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic dropped. Investors turned to the safe-haven metal after the US began a cycle of interest-rate cuts. Gold is currently at $2,621 an ounce, up 1.1pc today. The price has risen 36pc over the past year. The metal becomes a more attractive store of wealth when interest rates are lower, because gold does not pay interest or dividends. But Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said that foreign policy is also boosting gold: Geopolitical risks, such as ongoing conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, and elsewhere, will ensure to sustain gold’s safe-haven demand. The rise in gold comes on a difficult day for stock markets. US and European stock markets retreated following a record-filled rally that was triggered by the interest rate cut. The sell-off came as JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon voiced sceptism over the Fed’s hopes for a so-called “soft landing”. He said: I am a little more sceptical than other people. I give it lower odds. I hope its true, but I’m also more sceptical that inflation is going to go away so easily, not because it hasn’t come down - it has - and it can come down more. Kathleen Brooks, of trading platform XTB, told The Telegraph: Jamie Dimon saying that he is sceptical of the soft landing theory hasn’t helped sentiment. Also, Nvidia and other tech stocks are barometers of market sentiment these days and they have led the sell off in the US which has infiltrated sentiment to UK stocks. The Dow and the broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled following records the previous day in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s rate reduction and pledge of further cuts as inflation cools. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are currently down 0.4pc, while the Dow is down 0.2pc. Meanwhile, nearly £25bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 after it fell 1.2pc. The mid-cap FTSE 250 fell 1.6pc. On the Continent, Germany’s Dax lost 1.4pc and France’s Cac 40 dropped 1.5pc. Susannah Streeter, of broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: It’s a downbeat end to the week for the FTSE 100. The blue-chip index has ended lower, dragged back by pessimistic consumers and more hawkish comments about the direction of interest rates. Retailers were on the back foot with investors assessing it could be tougher going ahead after the GfK’s Consumer Confidence Barometer fell further into negative territory last month. Catherine Mann, a key policymaker at the Bank of England also warned that persistent inflationary pressures may mean borrowing costs will have to stay elevated for longer, adding to negative sentiment. The UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 stock index slipped on Friday, registering weekly declines, after hotter-than-expected retail sales data from the economy. However, a rise in the British pound pressured export-oriented companies. The FTSE 100 fell 1.2pc, while the more domestically-focussed midcap index lost 1.6pc. Both indexes marked weekly losses and their biggest one-day fall in almost seven weeks. British retail sales rose by a stronger-than-expected 1pc in August, beating forecasts for a monthly rise of 0.4pc and growth in July was revised up, data showed. The data provided an extra boost to the pound’s upbeat trend, which has risen to its highest level against the dollar since 2022 this week after the Federal Reserve cut rates by half a percentage point, while the Bank of England kept rates on hold at its meeting on Thursday. Friday’s declines were broad based, with all major sector indexes trading in the red, led by a 5pc drop in the “personal goods” index - made up of companies such as Watches of Switzerland, Dr Martens and Burberry. Precious metal miners were the only outliers, gaining 0.2pc after gold prices soared above the $2,600 level for the first time, extending a rally boosted by bets for further US interest rate cuts, and tensions in the Middle East. The stock market is stuck in a repeat of the 1990s dot-com bubble, a leading US investment bank has suggested. America’s S&P 5000 has jumped nearly 30pc over the past year amid high expections that artificial intelligence will fuel the future profits of big technology firms such as Nvidia and Microsoft. But in a note to clients, Barry Bannister, chief equity strategy as Stifel, said: It takes one generation to forget the dangers of a bubble, and it is Groundhog Day versus the 1990s Tech Bubble. Just as countries that go rogue become almost uninvestable, investors caught in the grips of a speculative fever become almost unanalysable. Bloomberg reported that Mr Bannister believes that the S&P 500 index will plunge to the “very low” 5,000s by the end of the year, suggesting around a 13pc decline. Groundhog Day is a 1993 movie in which a weatherman becomes trapped in a time loop. Wall Street slid this afternoon from yesterday’s record highs as the market knuckled down to the start of a rate reducing cycle that began with a mid-week jumbo cut by the US Federal Reserve. With the long-awaited decision made, markets mulled the motivations for the move, which Fed chairman Jerome Powell indicated should be seen as safeguarding a resilient economy, rather than an emergency response to weaker jobs data. All three major US stock indexes posted early losses but have still set a course to log weekly gains thanks to all-time highs hit on Thursday as buyers piled in to riskier assets. Marija Veitmane, head of equity research at State Street Global Markets, said: What Chairman Powell said was that they’re carefully watching the labour market, and if it slows too much they’re prepared to act. Powell also said that he doesn’t see the labour market as inflationary - that’s a positive message for risky assets. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1pc, the S&P 500 shed 0.4pc and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5pc. Some volatility is expected during the day, as options and futures linked to indexes and individual stocks are set to expire simultaneously, in an event called “triple witching” that falls on the third Friday of the last month of the quarter. The dollar strengthened this afternoon against the yen after the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged and indicated that it was not in a hurry to hike them again. The Bank of Japan could afford to spend time eyeing the fallout from global economic uncertainties, its governor, Kazuo Ueda, said. The BOJ had kept rates steady at 0.25pc as widely expected. The dollar rose 1.06pc to 144.14 yen, after hitting its highest level in a little over two weeks. The euro and pound also rose almost as much against the yen. Gold has hit a record high this afternoon, in the aftermath of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates. The safe-haven metal, which does not generate interest or dividends, can seem more appealing when interest rates are low. Gold is currently trading at just below $2,617 an ounce. Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at online trading platform IG, said: The gold price continues to surge and added another percent to this week’s gains with it trading in new record highs around the $2,615 per troy ounce mark. The oil price slid slightly, however, following its 6pc gains from its September multi-year lows. Next week’s economic calendar is on the light side, beginning on Monday with UK and US manufacturing and services PMIs [purchasing managers’ index] and culminating with Friday’s Fed preferred PCE [personal consumption expenditures] inflation gauge.” Construction group ISG, which was in the middle of numerous government projects including work to prisons, has collapsed into administration in the UK. The majority of its 2,400 employees have been made redundant after the UK business appointed joint administrators at EY, with trading stopping immediately. The construction services company had been trying to find a buyer but failed to secure a suitable rescue deal, EY said. The London-based business employs about 2,400 people across its UK business, the majority of whom will be made redundant with immediate effect. Around 200 employees will initially be kept on to assist the administrators in winding down the business. ISG is involved in 69 central government projects totalling more than £1 billion, including work on prisons for the Ministry of Justice, data analysts Barbour ABI said. A spokesperson for the Government said: We have implemented our detailed contingency plans and affected departments are working to ensure sites are safe and secure. Novo Nordisk’s shares fell nearly 6pc today after results from a trial of the Danish drugmaker’s experimental obesity pill monlunabant came in below market expectations. The company announced headline results from its trial of monlunabant, an experimental drug it acquired as part of its billion-dollar purchase of Canadian biotech company Inversago Pharmaceuticals last year. The company said at its capital markets day in March that it expected the drug could achieve weight loss of 15pc of body weight, on par with its mega-blockbuster obesity injection Wegovy. But in the headline trial results released today, the once-daily pill resulted in only 6.5pc weight loss after 16 weeks. Novo Nordisk shares are down 5.9pc. That weight loss is “not what optimists are looking for”, Nordnet analysts said. “Competition is intensifying. Investors are getting more cautious about the potential.” Despite the lower than expected weight loss, Novo Nordisk said that based on the results of the trial, it will initiate a larger trial to further investigate dosage of the medication and the safety profile of the drug “over a longer duration in a global population”. It expects to begin that trial next year. The US economy is not out of the woods yet and could still see a rise in unemployment, a Federal Reserve governor wrote in a paper published today. The US central bank cut its key lending rate by half a percentage point earlier this week in its first reduction for more than four years, sharply lowering borrowing costs in a bid to boost the economy and support the cooling labor market. But despite recent progress, there is still reason to be cautious about the world’s largest economy, Fed governor Christopher Waller wrote in a paper co-authored with Andrew Figura, a senior economist at the bank. “The labour market is not fully back to where it was prior to the pandemic, and inflation remains significantly” above the Fed’s long-term inflation target of 2pc, they wrote. “As a result, it is possible that a soft landing will not occur,” they added, referring to a scenario where inflation eases to target with only a “noticeably smaller increase in unemployment than has occurred in previous recessions.” But despite this warning, Mr Waller and Mr Figura said most forecasters still expected a soft landing, with only a “modest” rise in the unemployment rate. “Clearly, they also believe that a soft landing in the labour market is possible,” they added. Wall Street has dipped afternoon, and US stocks are drifting after they leaped to records yesterday during a worldwide rally. Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners, said: It is Friday, and after this week of all time highs on just about every index, it wouldn’t surprise me that both investors and traders are taking a break. The S&P 500 is down 0.3pc, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2pc and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4pc. FedEx dragged on the market with a drop of 14pc after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. It said American customers sent fewer packages through priority services, while it had to contend with higher wages for workers and other costs. FedEx also cut its forecast for revenue growth for its financial year. Helping to offset that is Nike, which jumped as much as 8.7pc after it named Elliott Hill as its chief executive. Mr Hill, 60, had spent more than three decades at Nike in various leadership positions before retiring in 2020. Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company slumped to their lowest level ever after Wall Street opened this afternoon. Today is the first day that the former US president, the biggest shareholder, is free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform. Shares of Trump Media tumbled almost 7pc, putting the value of the company at less than £2.25bn. Trump owns more than half of it. Trump and other insiders in the company have been unable to cash in on the highly volatile stock due standard lock-up agreements that prevent big stakeholders from selling stakes for a set period after a company becomes publicly traded. Trump Media began trading publicly in March. One week ago, the company’s shares jumped nearly 12pc after Trump said he wouldn’t sell shares when the lock-up period lifted. The stock dipped more than 10pc following the debate earlier this month between Trump and the Democrats’ nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. In mid-July, shares climbed more than 31[c in the first day of trading following the first assassination attempt on Trump. Trump Media is now worth considerably less than several months ago. When the company made its debut on the Nasdaq in March, shares hit a high of $79.38. Investors will be hoping to hear some reassurance from furniture giant DFS after the chain warned its profits are being squeezed by shipping delays and record low levels of demand among sofa-buyers. The London-listed business will report its full-year financial results on Wednesday. It comes after the chain has lowered its profit expectations twice this year as economic conditions turned out to be tougher than it had expected. In its last update in June, DFS said it was anticipating underlying pre-tax profits for the year to the end of June to be up to £12m lower than the prior year, when it generated just over £30m. This decline was partly blamed on it being unable to deliver as many orders to customers thanks to disruption in the Red Sea. DFS said the delayed deliveries were worth about £12-14m, and were expected to be pushed back into the 2025 financial year. Meanwhile, the furniture seller has also warned over softer demand for upholstery with buyers holding back on making more expensive purchases. But shareholders could be hoping for signs of recovery in the market, with consumers benefiting from a sharp drop in inflation and interest rates starting to come down. The group is expecting revenues for the year to total between £995m and £1bn, following a series of downgrades from an initial forecast of up to £1.1bn. US and European stock markets have retreated today following a rally triggered by a jumbo US interest rate cut this week. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading American companies and the broad-based S&P500 index opened in the red following records the previous day. It comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s half a percentage point rate reduction and pledge of further cuts as inflation cools. “Some profit-taking as we end the week is to be expected” following the rallies, said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB. There had been fears the move could signal officials were worried about the economy and were behind the curve in easing policy. But new figures yesterday showing jobless claims at their lowest since May suggested the United States was heading for a soft landing, rather than recession. The FTSE 100, Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac 40 are all down 1.2pc. The S&P 500 is down 0.4pc, the Dow is down 0.2pc and the Nasdaq is down 0.3pc. The FTSE could be given a shot in the arm were Britain to copy the state pension system used in Sweden or Chile, according to a new paper by the Adam Smith Institute. The free-market think tank argues that working people should be given a choice of approved funds into which they could invest state pension contributions while working. The pensions would be backed by a “safety net”. The paper says: Instead of using a pay-as-you-go system in which today’s pensions are funded by today’s taxpayers, a system vulnerable to demographic changes, people pay into funds that ultimately supply their pensions in retirement. They choose between approved providers and receive regular notification of their fund’s current worth. They can switch between providers at set intervals. Madsen Pirie, the author, told The Telegraph: This would create massive investment funds to boost the market, and would free government from the future burden of supplying unfunded pensions at massive cost to taxpayers. It would push a wall of money onto the stock exchange, giving it just the boost it needs at a challenging time. It’s a win-win policy he pointed out, without any losers. The paper says that, in Chile, “around half of the assets under private management are reinvested domestically”. A closed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania is to reopen after Microsoft signed a deal to buy the power it generates. The Three Mile Island nuclear plant closed in 2019 after owner Constellation Energy concluded that running it was no longer economic. But it will reopen in 2028 after Microsoft agreed to buy its output for over two decades. Constellation is investing $1.6bn to upgrade the plant. This will be the first ever restart of a nuclear power plant in the US after shutting, and shows how utilities are benefiting from a massive surge in demand from data-centre operators looking to ride a boom in artificial intelligence. Three Mile Island is also the location of a reactor, under different ownership, that was shut down 45 years ago after a partial nuclear meltdown caused the most significant commercial nuclear accident in American history. Constellation Energy shares have shot up 15pc this afternoon on the news. Wall Street’s main indexes are said to be set for a muted open on Friday after a rally in the previous session that was sparked by a jumbo interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 notched its eighth working day of gains out of nine on Thursday and closed at an all-time high, breaching its mid-July milestone. The blue-chip Dow also notched a record high and settled above the psychological level of 42,000 points. All three major indexes are on track for weekly gains of over 1pc, with the benchmark set to buck the historical trend of September being weaker for US equities on average. Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at InfraCap, said: All you had [this week] was the Fed. The Fed’s over. The rest of the world decided to buy the U.S. market and also bid up their markets ... and now this is the fade. The most bullish thing that can happen after such a big run is a stall. Thanks for joining this morning. I’m now handing over to my colleague Alex Singleton to see you through the afternoon. In a report where HSBC suggests the Bank of England could look to cut rates at every meeting next year, analysts have some interesting conclusions: “UK GDP may have flatlined in recent readings, and sentiment may not be great ahead of the Budget. But there has been better news on inflation, and we now think the BoE will be able to cut by another 100bp by the end of 2025 versus our previous forecast, helping to lift growth, particularly in 2026. “If we are right, there is a risk that this amount of easing proves excessively stimulatory, and the BoE has to stop or even reverse course. For now, though, more is more.” Public debt as a share of the economy has hit 100pc for the first time since the 1960s, in a psychologically important moment that underscores the challenge facing the Chancellor ahead of her October 30 fiscal statement, Szu Ping Chan reports. Official figures showed public borrowing is £6.2bn higher than expected this year, with debt now equalling the size of the economy.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the increase was driven in August by “higher spending on public services”, including pay and benefits, with the government borrowing £13.7bn in August to plug the gap between taxes and spending.This is higher than the £11.2bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government’s tax and spending watchdog, and represents the third highest August borrowing since monthly records began in January 1993. “Higher-than-expected borrowing continues to be driven by departmental spending ... which is £8.5bn above forecast,” the OBR said on Friday. It brings the total borrowed so far this year to £64.1bn, £6.2bn more than the £57.8bn forecast by the OBR back in March. A US energy giant has chosen South Yorkshire to host a landmark £1.5bn factory building the next generation of nuclear reactors in a major boost for the region, Jonathan Leake and Matt Oliver report. Holtec, a privately owned nuclear company headquartered in Florida, is looking at sites across the county including around the city of Doncaster, where Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has his constituency.If built, the £1.5bn factory could create up to 3,000 high-tech jobs to produce the components for small modular reactors (SMRs), the technology which could become the backbone of the UK’s planned nuclear revival.The firm, which specialises in nuclear energy, has been searching for suitable sites with rival options in the West Midlands, Cumbria and Teesside considered.

The currency was down by as much as 1.1pc against the dollar after Governor Kazuo Ueda said the BOJ would continue rate rises if economic and inflation trends moved in line with its outlook. However, he said that upside risks to inflation from the yen’s weakness were easing. It follows the BOJ opting to keep interest rates unchanged on Friday, following increases in March and July. Union bosses have said workers on the Heathrow Express train line will go on strike next week, after they voted not to accept a pay offer. RMT said workers would be staging a 48-hour walkout from Monday, following a “strong mandate for action”. RMT General Secretary Mike Lynch said: “Our members at Heathrow Express have made their position clear with a strong mandate for action. They are determined to secure fair pay and better working conditions. “Heathrow Express management must now recognise the serious concerns of the workforce and return to the table with a meaningful offer.” The RMT said the union was open to further negotiations. Heathrow Express said train schedules would not be affected by the strike action, with “no disruption” to services. Dr Martens has fallen to a record low on the London markets, after it emerged that an unnamed investor had sold 70m shares. The British bootmaker shares were down almost 16pc on Friday. The 70m share sale took place via Goldman Sachs, with shares sold at a discount price. It means shares in Dr Martens are now around 85pc lower than their IPO price in 2021. The company has been struggling with its US business, which is its largest market. In April, it suggested profits could fall as much as two thirds in the worst case scenario. Dr Martens chief executive Kenny Wilson announced he was leaving the company and was replaced by Dr Martens’ chief brand officer, Ije Nwokorie. The Office for National Statistics have some charts showing today’s official borrowing figures in context. Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was £13.7 billion in August 2024, £3.3 billion more than in August 2023 and the third highest August borrowing on record, behind 2020 and 2021.Read more ➡️ https://t.co/TZURmjBKXB pic.twitter.com/K8CN79gvPp — Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) September 20, 2024 Catherine Mann has given more detail on why she decided to vote to keep BoE rates on hold in Lithuania this morning. In her speech, she said: “Why was it not good policy for me to vote to hike at this September meeting, to get back to the August stance, if I thought that was the appropriate level for Bank Rate?”In fact, in August, I did contemplate a cut at that meeting, as the bite from housing costs was becoming deeper and more widespread but was dissuaded by the balance of factors already mentioned, as well as a generalized easing in global conditions that affected UK rates too.”If I had voted to hike in the meeting just past only to cut sometime soon hence, this would be the ‘boogie-dance’ with policy rates that I eschewed in my Lamfalussy speech in February 2023.” Elsewhere, overnight, Industry Editor Matt Oliver reported on Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s car company being forced to halt production as the supplier of a crucial component used in its vehicles battles possible bankruptcy. Ineos Automotive, part of the billionaire’s chemicals empire, said it had temporarily stopped making Grenadier SUVs and Quartermaster pickup trucks at its factory in Hambach, France, due to a “critical component shortage”. Lynn Calder, chief executive, said the holdup was due to the supplier of the crucial car parts facing a “pre-insolvency situation”. “It’s a trim part but one that we can’t sell the car without,” she told Automotive News Europe. The company has not identified the part and Ms Calder declined to name the supplier. But production might not resume until late this year or early 2025, she warned. Read more here. Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann has said she is taking a “guarded view” on multiple interest rate cuts in the coming months. In a speech due to be delivered in Lithuania today, Ms Mann said: “While agreeing with the majority for a hold at the meeting just concluded, I have a guarded view on initiating a cutting cycle. “A risk management assessment implies that it is better, under inflation uncertainty, to remain restrictive for longer, until right tail risks to the inflation process dissipate, and then to cut more aggressively.” Ms Mann sits on the Monetary Policy Committee which this week voted to keep interest rates at 5pc. Two-year mortgage deals are looking more competitive for buyers, amid growing expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again this year. Rates of shorter term deals are now falling faster than those for longer terms for the first time in two years, according to data from Moneyfacts. Santander this week started offering a two-year deal of less than 4pc, while other lenders including HSBC, NatWest and Virgin Money have also cut rates over the past week. The moves come amid growing expectations that the Bank of England will be able to lower interest rates further in the coming months. The Bank of England cut rates for the first time in four years last month. The markets are still expecting two more cuts before the end of the year. The hopes were boosted earlier this week, when official figures showed prices, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose by 2.2pc in the year to August. This was unchanegd from July. Rightmove’s Matt Smith said: “We’re still expecting two rate cuts before the end of the year, and home-movers should continue to see a downward trend in mortgage rates this side of Christmas. “Overall, I think there’s an optimistic mood about where we’re heading, and lowering mortgage rates is supporting the increased home-moving activity we’re seeing right now, particularly against last year.” Tim Wallace, the Telegraph’s deputy economics editor, has more on the borrowing figures here: If the news that debt has hit 100pc of GDP looks familiar, that is because the ONS has reported this before - only to revise the fact away when it gets its hands on more data. In June of 2023, for instance, the national debt was thought to have grown larger than the economy. The same was claimed in 2020 amid plunging GDP and ballooning debt. But the calculation relies on both debt and on GDP, each of which is revised as more data comes in. So a growth spurt in the economy can bring the ratio down, and on other occasions it turns out the Government spent less than initially thought, or tax receipts came in higher than was first estimated. City grandees and influential economists have urged the Chancellor to give a message of hope after consumer confidence sunk in September. GfK’s consumer confidence measure fell by seven points to -20 in September, new figures revealed this morning. Sir Philip Hampton, the former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, GSK and Sainsbury’s, told The Telegraph: “The more politicians are gloomy of course the more these sort of animal instincts are going to be constrained. “I do think that there’s a job of political leadership to remind people that innovation, discovery and change can happen even within a very financially constrained Government.” Read more here. The German economy minister Robert Habeck has offered to help Volkswagen to avoid site closures. Speaking during a visit to the company’s factory in Emden, Mr Habeck said the Government could help by sending the right market signals, including making it more attractive to switch to electric cars. However, he said there were some limits to what the Government could do, telling reporters: “A large part of the tasks have to be dealt with by Volkswagen itself. This is the company’s job.” It comes after the German media reported that Volkswagen was considering axing as many as 30,000 jobs to cope with the slowdown in the car market. The company is considering closing some of its German factories for the first time in history, with Manager Magazin, a leading German business publication, suggesting 30,000 roles could go. A spokesman for the company earlier this week said: “We do not confirm the figure. One thing is clear: Volkswagen has to reduce its costs at its German sites. “This is the only way the brand can offer attractively priced vehicles and still make enough money for future investments. “How we will achieve this goal together with the employee representatives is part of the upcoming talks.” Overnight, sportswear giant Nike announced long-time executive Elliott Hill would be rejoining the company as CEO as it scrambles to stage a turnaround. The company said Mr Hill would be succeeding John Donahoe as president and chief executive, sending shares up 8pc in after-hours trading. Mr Hill retired from Nike in 2020, having previously been with the business for 32 years. In his last role, he had led all commercial and market operations for the Nike and Jordan brands. He is poised to take over on October 14 It comes as the latest bid by Nike to revive sales, following months of waning demand among shoppers. Analysts have attributed the decline to the lack of new innovative products being released by Nike. In June, shares slumped by a fifth as it warned sales were likely to fall this year by a mid-single digit percentage. Thames Water has this morning confirmed it is in talks to extend its funding options, amid a race to avoid nationalisation. The troubled utility giant said it was exploring options for extending its liquidity runway, with creditors drawing up a rescue package. It comes after news of the talks emerged last night, with the Telegraph reporting that Thames Water was seeking to delay repayments until after Ofwat’s decision on how much the utility can increase bills by over the next five years. This is expected to come in January and is set to be critical in whether Britain’s biggest water company will be able to raise fresh funds or not. A source close to the company told the newspaper: “This is about trying to push back the loans as they fall due to extend our liquidity runway.” It comes amid growing concerns that Thames Water is heading for nationalisation. The move is thought to be almost inevitable if Thames Water fails to secure fresh investment as it struggles under the weight of a £16bn debt pile. Debt at the end of August 2024 was provisionally estimated at 100.0% of GDP, 4.3 percentage points higher than at the same point last year and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s.https://t.co/F5EnA5dx40 pic.twitter.com/WQotfKqoCC — Fraser Munro (@Fraser_ONS_PSF) September 20, 2024 Britain’s high streets received a boost last month after warmer weather and end-of-season sales drew in more customers. Retail sales were up 1pc in August, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics, compared to a 0.7pc rise in July. For the three months to August, sales were up 1.2pc versus the three-month period to May. It came despite growing concerns over consumer spending. Separate data this morning suggested families were feeling more anxious about their finances and the economy. Figures from GfK revealed that consumer confidence plunged by seven points to -20 in September. Concerns have been mounting that Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are talking Britain into a downturn. Phil Monkhouse, UK Country Manager at global financial services firm Ebury, said: “Retailers have enjoyed another bumper month in retail sales, with August seeing a 1.0pc uptick amid warmer weather and end-of-season sales. “Consumers seem to be finding their footing, bolstered by the Bank of England’s first rate cut since 2020, which has eased mortgage pressures and sparked renewed confidence in the UK’s economic outlook. “With summer now over, retailers will now need to focus on sustaining growth ahead of the autumnal weather threatening future footfall. “Alongside utilising the back-to-school season, agile strategies to meet consumer demand and adopting hedging strategies to protect against international disruptions will help businesses navigate any challenges in the months ahead.” Separately, new figures have come out this morning on public borrowing, showing the deficit came in at £64.1bn between April and August this year. It meant UK borrowing overshot forecasts by more than £6bn over the summer. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said:“When we came into office, we inherited an economy that wasn’t working for working people. Today’s data shows the highest August borrowing on record, outside the pandemic.”Debt is 100pc of GDP, the highest level since the 1960s. Because of the £22bn black hole in our public finances we have inherited this year alone, we are now taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.” Reacting to the ONS retail sales figures this morning, Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, said: “The late arrival of sunshine and the busy agenda of sporting events in August gave a much-needed lift to UK retail sales, with consumers spending more on summer clothing ranges and food for outdoor socialising. “The first cut in interest rates in four years last month saw a rebound in the property market, which might have led to the growth in sales of household goods.“While many consumers remain cautious and are opting out of purchasing big ticket or luxury items, some are still treating themselves by spending on little luxuries, resulting in a boost in sales of small discretionary items in personal care and in premium food categories.” Official figures have revealed a rise in retail sales in August, despite fears of waning consumer confidence. 1) Confidence slumps amid concerns Labour is talking Britain into recession | Families feeling less upbeat as ‘gloomy politicians’ reiterate warnings about the economy 2) South Yorkshire to host Britain’s first mini-nuclear reactor factory | Major boost for region as Holtec unveils preferred location for £1.5bn project 3) Thames Water seeks to delay billions in debt repayments in scramble to avoid nationalisation | The troubled utility giant is in last-ditch talks with lenders to extend its cash runway beyond next May 4) Amazon criticised by Business Secretary for ordering staff back to the office | Workers should be judged on output not time sat at their desk, says Jonathan Reynolds 5) Jim Ratcliffe forced to halt production of Ineos Grenadier | Billionaire’s car company suspends manufacturing amid ‘critical component shortage’ Asian shares extended their rally on Friday, bathing in the afterglow of an outsized interest rate cut in the United States, while the yen edged higher as the Bank of Japan held rates steady and stayed upbeat on the economy Japan’s Nikkei share average pared early gains amid a firmer yen on Friday, after the Bank of Japan kept its interest rates unchanged, as expected, and also upgraded its assessment on consumption. The Nikkei share average rose 1.8pc to 37,834.09 early in the afternoon session, after entering the midday recess up 2.1pc. The yen strengthened against the dollar to be about 0.3pc stronger at 142.16, as of 3.36 BST, after initially shrugging off the policy decision, which came when stock and bond markets were in the trading break. Benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond futures declined 0.08 yen to 144.58 yen. Cash bonds had yet to trade following the BOJ announcement.. In China, the central bank kept its benchmark lending rates on hold, countering expectations for a move lower. Chinese shares were an outlier in the region, with blue chips down 0.3pc. The onshore yuan strengthened to the highest in nearly 16 months, leading to intervention by state banks to prevent it from appreciating too fast. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7pc to the highest in two months, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street. The index was headed for a weekly gain of 2.5pc. Wall Street stocks soared to fresh records last night as markets cheered the Federal Reserve’s move to aggressively cut interest rates to protect the labour market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3pc to 42,025.19, its first close above 42,000. The S&P 500 also shot to an all-time high, surging 1.7pc to 5,713.64, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite index jumped 2.5pc to 18,013.98.

Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a colorful pair of sneakers to complement your athleisure, these are the best Hoka deals available right now. Hoka This sneaker is our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall. It’s comfortable with tons of cushion and lighter than the previous iteration. This discount is only available in three colorways, but a solid range of sizes. Hoka If you’re not sold on the Speedgoat 5, check out the Torrent 3, on sale for 20% off. The style is also designed for trail running, featuring a durable outsole, low-profile cushioning and neutral support. You can shop three colors at the moment, but sizing is limited. REI Avid hikers will appreciate this boot’s ample cushioning and Hubble heel design (for smoother heel-to-toe movement). The shoe is also waterproof and has a more streamlined aesthetic than your classic hiking boot. This discount is currently available in the color pictured above. Hoka We named the Hoka Arahi 7, which is designed to keep your feet from overpronating, the best cushioned sneaker for arch support (as well as the best stability running shoe for men). This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but most sizes are still in stock. Dick's Sporting Goods Designed to balance cushion with a streamlined silhouette, this lightweight shoe is great for racing and daily runs. Four colors are currently on sale—some for even less—but the pictured colorway has the widest range of sizes available.

This deal is currently available in two colors, both with a solid array of sizes to choose from. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for as much as 40% off.

This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock absorption and stability without weighing you down. They also come in a variety of bright color combinations to suit most styles and preferences.

Title: Amazon's return-to-office order bucks job flexibility trend
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366611269/Amazons-return-to-office-order-bucks-job-flexibility-trend
Time Published: 2024-09-20T16:33:00Z

Getty Images/iStockphoto Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent return-to-office order might be more about staff reductions than improving watercooler brainstorming. His letter to employees talks about flattening the organization and having fewer managers. But that language raises suspicion among recruiting experts that the company wants to reduce headcount through attrition. If Amazon wants to reduce headcount, "this is an easy way to do it," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job marketplace ZipRecruiter, of the return-to-office mandate. It might cause natural attrition from workers unhappy with the order and help the company avoid mass layoffs, she said. "At the same time, you can always retain your superstar performers by negotiating exceptions for them on a one-on-one basis," Pollak said. But she also said it's possible Amazon had trouble running an effective remote work program. Despite Amazon's return-to-work order, flexible work arrangements have remained constant, according to ZipRecruiter's quarterly analysis of labor market changes. The current share of remote and hybrid job postings in the tech industry is above 20%, similar to 2021 data, Pollak said. "We don't see much pullback," she said. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, a telecommuting research and consulting firm, said she sees return-to-office mandates as being connected to staff reduction goals. "There's no doubt that AI will replace many of the types of jobs people do at places like Amazon," Lister said. "Even prior to the pandemic, hybrid work reversals were often a thinly disguised attempt to get people to quit, rather than having to lay them off." For employers, remote and hybrid work options will produce three times as many job applications compared with non-remote positions, Pollak said. When companies offer these options, attrition falls around 35%, she said. "Workers who work remotely are prepared to take an 8% pay cut because they value it so much," she said. There is little in job ad data that suggests Amazon's return-to-office order is a future of work trend. While there has been some pullback on fully remote jobs, at least in job listings, hybrid job ads are on the rise. Employer preference is shifting to hybrid work, according to data from WilsonHCG, a recruitment processing outsourcing provider. It has found that remote job postings account for 3.4% of all job postings in the U.S., or about 220,000 jobs, a decline ranging from 5% to 6% a year ago. But there has been a shift to hybrid ads, which is nearing 2% of all job postings, nearly double that from 18 to 24 months ago, according to the firm. What employers want is the ability to have workers on-site when needed, said Charles Faigle, executive vice president of talent solutions in the Americas at WilsonHCG. "It's all about flexibility within their workforce," he said. The workforce is also shifting in other ways. TalentNeuron, a labor market intelligence firm, said it is seeing a rise in the 40-hour, four-day workweek, according to an analysis of job postings. The job areas with the highest rise for this trend are medical and health, engineering, quality assurance, IT, administrative and clerical, and operations and logistics. "Many employees cite the four-day workweek as a primary incentive -- even over salary -- for the considerations around a role," said Erica Lee, a senior consultant at TalentNeuron. The firm identified, for instance, 103,000 job postings in the medical and health care field that explicitly mentioned a four-day workweek. These job ads represented less than 5% of the total current job ads, but the overall trend of the four-day workweek has increased more than 50% over the last several years. Dan Schwabel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm, said he sees a trend to tech employees losing remote work options, although it varies by companies. "Some tech companies continue to offer flexible or fully remote options to attract and retain talent," Schawbel said. "Smaller startups and certain tech roles may still provide more flexibility."

Title: Top US money managers cut support for ESG proposals amid Republican pushback
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/09/20/business/largest-us-asset-managers-cut-support-for-climate-change-proposals/
Time Published: 2024-09-20T15:44:38Z
Full Content:
The three biggest US asset managers cut their support for so-called ESG proposals by shareholders during the last voting season amid Republican pushback against the controversial investing policy, according to a report. BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — which collectively own about 20% of the shares of all companies in the S&P 500 — shied away from backing Environmental, Social and Governance resolutions that focus on topics such as climate change, workforce diversity and human rights when compared to previous years, Bloomberg reported. BlackRock – the world’s largest money manager with around $10.5 trillion dollars under management, according to Statista – said it voted for 4% of the environmental proposals in the 12 months ending June, a decline from the 7% it voted for the year before. In a 2024 proxy voting report, BlackRock said the majority of climate proposals “were over-reaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term shareholder value.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has long backed ESG goals, but recently began scaling back his support amid investigations by 19 state attorneys general in conservative states who alleged that the asset manager’s ESG-related policies hurt the American energy industry. The probe led to an investment boycott of BlackRock in Texas. Fink said he was dropping the term “ESG” from his vocabulary because it had become so polarizing. State State’s investing unit said it supported 6% of environmental shareholder proposals in the first half of the year and 7% of social ones, less than it did in the same period last year. The Boston-based firm – which manages $4.4 trillion – said the ESG proposals were becoming increasingly “prescriptive” and “complex.” The Vanguard Group – which managed around $7 trillion as of 2021 – said last month that it didn’t back any environmental resolutions. The Malvern, Penn.-based investment advisor echoed State Street’s claim that the proposals were becoming too “prescriptive.” “The proposals did not address financially material risks to shareholders at the companies in question,” Vanguard said in its US Regional Brief report. State Street, Vanguard and BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The pullback in support is a sharp turnaround from 2021, when US companies and money managers launched a slew of environmental initiatives. The current political climate had a clear impact on the asset managers’ policy pivot, Morningstar Sustainalytics’ Lindsey Stewart told Bloomberg. “But the fact is, even some of the pro-ESG resolutions were badly worded or lacked a clear benefit to shareholders, so it’s not surprising that firms rejected many of these resolutions,” he said. Though Democrats have defended the need for ESG in the workplace, Republican politicians have attacked the initiatives as the Biden-Harris administration’s “woke” way for the corporate world to implement what they argue is a politically liberal agenda. Total shareholder support for environmental and social resolutions dropped to 19% in the latest proxy season from about 22% in the same period last year, according to Morningstar. The decline in shareholder support aligns with a similar shift among business leaders. Chief executive officers have pushed sustainability down on their lists of priorities, according to a survey by Bain & Co. Concerns about inflation, artificial intelligence and geopolitics now top the lists, Bain said. The resolution flip-flop comes as Republicans have been pressuring the finance industry and large companies to reverse their environmental and DEI goals. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck, in particular, has been leading the call for DEI reversals. The 35-year-old unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Tennessee in 2022. Backed by more than 620,000 followers on X, Starbuck has cornered businesses like Tractor Supply, Harley-Davidson and Ford into abandoning their DEI initiatives by threatening them with boycotts. Now, the finance industry is facing the same heat to reverse its climate change and social goals. State pensions in Texas and Florida have already pulled money from BlackRock. The top three money managers’ voting records stand in contrast with some European rivals, who continue to focus on sustainability goals, Stewart told Bloomberg. Advertisement

Title: FedEx Stock Tanks Amid 'Challenging' Demand Environment

FedEx (FDX) shares plunged 15% Friday, a day after the package delivery giant missed quarterly estimates and reduced its forecast as it faced what Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajesh Subramaniam called a "challenging Q1 demand environment," especially in the U.S. Subramaniam told analysts that weakness in the industrial economy dragged down business-to-business (B2B) volumes. Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere added that the drop in B2B sales led to a 3% volume decline in U.S. domestic express services. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John Dietrich noted that the results "were negatively affected by soft revenue trends, with a global decline in priority volume and growth in deferred volume." Deitrich said in light of the first-quarter performance, FedEx was cutting the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $21 from $22. FedEx also sees revenue growth to be in a low-single-digit percentage, down from its earlier forecast of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. Following the report, Jefferies reduced its price target to $275 from $300. The analysts argued that with the current quarter expected to be pressured and its first-half EPS estimates down 20%, "we do not think the company can achieve the low end of its EPS guide." Shares of FedEx plunged more than 15% in late-morning trading Friday to $254.30, less than 1% above where they began the year.

Title: Novo Nordisk stock tumbled over the latest results for its experimental weight loss pill

Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced mixed results today for a phase 2 trial of an experimental weight loss pill that works differently than its already-popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 6% during Friday morning trading after it posted the results. The Danish pharma giant tested monlunabant, a drug it acquired in 2023 with its $1 billion purchase of Inversago Pharma, in a phase 2 trial involving 243 participants with obesity and other related health complications. Monlunabant works by blocking CB1 receptors, which are found in the brain and nervous system and have an effect on appetite. Conversely, Wegovy works by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and reduces appetite. The new drug was tested in once-daily doses of 10mg, 20mg, and 50mg. Starting from an average weight of 110.1 kg (242.7 lbs), participants taking any dose of monlunabant lost significantly more weight than those on a placebo. After 16 weeks, people taking a daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant lost an average of 7.1 kg (15.6 lbs), or about 6% of their weight, while the placebo group only lost about 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs). Higher doses didn’t result in much more weight loss beyond that. In the trial, the most common side effects were digestive issues, which were generally mild to moderate and depended on the dose. People taking monlunabant also reported more mild-to-moderate mood-related side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep problems, compared to those on a placebo. However, Novo Nordisk reported no severe neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of development at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Novo Nordisk said it is plans to start a larger phase 2 trial of the drug in 2025.

Alliance Entertainment (AENT), a leader in direct-to-consumer and e-commerce in the entertainment sector, disclosed its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 on [date]. The company reported a decrease in net revenue for Q4 to $236.9 million from $247.1 million the previous year, with a gross profit of $26.9 million. Despite the revenue dip, they saw an improvement in net income and a significant reduction in operating expenses, debt, and inventory levels. Management remains optimistic about future growth, highlighting strategies for cost savings, operational efficiencies, and revenue expansion through acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals. Alliance Entertainment's earnings call revealed a mixed financial performance with declines in revenue but improvements in net income and operational efficiencies. The company's management is confident in their growth strategy, which includes leveraging exclusive distribution rights and pursuing strategic acquisitions to boost revenue. They also anticipate cost savings from operational consolidations and technological investments. With these measures, Alliance Entertainment is positioning itself for a stronger performance in the coming fiscal years. Alliance Entertainment, with a market capitalization of $103.91 million, has been navigating a challenging fiscal period, as reflected in its latest financial results. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 stands at $1.11 billion, marking a decline of 5.62% from the previous year. Despite the dip in revenue, the firm's gross profit margin has remained relatively stable at 11.9%. InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alliance Entertainment has had a significant return over the last week, with a 12.83% price total return, and even more impressively, a 44.53% return over the last month. This indicates a recent surge in investor confidence, which may be tied to the company's strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals as outlined in their recent earnings call. Moreover, the company's valuation implies a strong free cash flow yield, which could be a sign of underlying financial health and potential for future profitability, as analysts predict the company will be profitable this year. Investors considering Alliance Entertainment should note that the stock generally trades with high price volatility, which could present opportunities for high-reward investments but also carries a greater risk. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are 10 additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering further insights into the company's performance and investment potential. In summary, while Alliance Entertainment has faced revenue challenges, the company's recent price performance and the potential for improved profitability present an interesting case for investors. The company's strategic focus on cost savings and revenue expansion through acquisitions may well set the stage for a stronger financial standing in the near future.

Your host today, Bruce Ogilvie, Executive Chairman; and Jeff Walker, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will present the results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. At this time, I will turn the call over to Alliance Entertainment Executive Chairman, Bruce Ogilvie. Bruce Ogilvie: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call. For those of you that are new to our story, we bring entertainment to you. We are a category leading direct-to-consumer and e-commerce provider for the entertainment industry, serving as the gateway between brands and retailers. With over 325,000 SKUs in stock, we provide the world's largest selection of music, home video movies, video games, gaming, hardware, arcades, collectibles, toys, and consumer electronics. We are a needed supplier for omni retailers in helping them expand their long tail entertainment selection online and putting them on a level playing field with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). We white label all their direct-to-consumer shipments to look like it was shipped by the omni retailer, but it was really shipped by Alliance. We are a trusted omni-channel supplier to retailers and wholesalers worldwide, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Target, Kohls, BJ's, Meyer, plus 2,500 independent music stores and many other retailers. We are a trusted distributor of home entertainment movies for Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Paramount, Sony (NYSE:SONY) Pictures, Warner Brothers, the Universal Pictures and others. For video games, video game consoles, retro arcades, controllers, and physical software games. We distribute products for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nintendo, Arcade1Up, Activision, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Sega, Ubisoft, Square Enix, and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO). In music for LPs, CDs and YES cassettes. We are a trusted distributor for Universal Music (AS:UMG), Sony Music, Warner Music Group, and every independent music label. For the toys category, for collectibles, we distribute for Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), LEGO, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), and over 600 other suppliers. Alliance Entertainment is a global leader in the 10 billion physical media industry, and we generate over $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 with our team of 654 dedicated employee owners. Our leading position in the industry provides us with unparalleled scale and leveraged and has created significant structural and economic barriers of entry that we believe safeguards our market leadership position. We are a value-added retail distributor with exclusive distribution rights for approximately 150 movie studios and music labels and the film and music industry. Our exclusive distribution licensing deals accounted for over $250 million of our revenue in fiscal 2024. Our extensive portfolio of unique content combined with our deep inventory of long tail selections of the more than 325,000 in stock SKUs enables us to cater to bulk shipments for B2B and direct-to-consumer retailers with a vast selection of products, including a growing number of products unavailable through other distributor competitors. This helps us create sticky relationships with our retailers, and growing these exclusive relationships is a key for us moving forward. We have over 200 online retailers that rely on us to stock the world's largest selection of entertainment products for them, and we shipped to more than 35,000 storefronts reaching 72 countries globally. Importantly, we have a long and proven track record of growth through strategic acquisitions. Over the past 20 years, we successively acquired and integrated a dozen companies allowing us to rapidly enter new markets, expand our product selection, and further diversify our revenue streams. Building Alliance from the ground up into the market leader has provided our team with a deep bench and unrivaled experience, which further strengthens our position as we remain very much aligned with our shareholders, with insiders and employees holding approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of the company. After experiencing a surge in demand during the pandemic, many areas within the physical media market have been normalizing back to the historical growth levels in the high single-digits. Even the CD market has joined the revival with CDs outselling digital albums at a rate of 3 to 1 margin in the first 6 months of the year, according to a mid-year report from the Recording Industry Association of America. As part of our $1.1 billion annual revenue, over $250 million was generated from products for which we are the exclusive distributor. These exclusive deals are managed through our Distribution Solutions, AMPED, Mill Creek and Arcade1Up division, and they have significantly enhanced our market position by providing unique content that deepens relationship with both suppliers and retailers. Distribution Solutions was responsible for $134 million of this revenue in the first fiscal 2024. Distribution Solutions partners with over 60 home video movie studios to manufacture, supply, and market their content. We distribute this exclusive content to major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target, as well as thousands of other smaller retailers. By leveraging Alliance Entertainment's vast distribution network, this exclusive content creates a strong, sticky relationship with retailers, strengthening ongoing demand. In addition, Distribution Solutions have developed a growing digital distribution business. In fiscal year 2023, we generated $8.4 million in digital revenue, and we have more than doubled that in fiscal 2024 reaching $20 million. On the music side, our AMPED division is a leader in physical distribution of exclusive music content. AMPED works more than 90 exclusive music labels distributing music across major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target, as well as over 2,500 independent music stores throughout the U.S. Labels and artists such as Shaboozey, Usher, K-Pop sensation, ATEEZ, can bypass major music suppliers, thus lowering their cost and self-distribute themselves using AMPED for their physical distribution needs because they control their own digital streaming and social media marketing, while maximizing profitability through our extensive brick and mortar and omni retail relationship. K-Pop in particular has become a rapidly growing segment for AMPED, contributing significantly to our sales growth. Our Mill Creek division specializes in exclusive video content licensing from major studios, including Disney, Sony Pictures, Universal, Lionsgate Studios and others. Mill Creek licenses, manufactures and distributes DVDs for these leading studios, enhancing our ability to offer exclusive unique and in demand video content that is sought out by consumers and retailers alike. We are also exclusive North American distributor for Arcade1Up, which licenses and manufactures home arcade consoles with significant market share in the retro gaming space. These include some of the most well recognized arcade games like PAC-MAN, Ms. PAC-MAN, NBA Jam, Mortal Kombat, Golden Tee, and more. The Infinity Game Table even includes a digital version of classic board games, including Hasbro’s Monopoly, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Chutes, Platters, Candy Land, Yahtzee, and many other iconic games. We've had a long history of discipline accredited acquisitions, and I want to take a moment to highlight the strategic acquisitions that have been critical to our gaining leadership position in the entertainment space and our growth overall. By 2013, Jeff and I had built up Super D from $18 million in sales, starting in 2001 to $194 million. Then we made the pivotal move in requiring Alliance Entertainment, our largest competitor, which was doing $725 million in revenue at the time and significantly expanded our footprint, transforming us overnight into the largest distributor of music and video in the world. This acquisition marked our first major step in consolidating the package media categories of music and video. We continue to build on this strategy in 2016 with the acquisition of ANconnect, which gave us exclusive access to sell CDs to Walmart and Best Buy, and expanded our important vendor managing inventory capabilities for our portfolio. Our entry into the gaming space came in 2018 through the acquisition of Mecca enabling us to distribute products from major suppliers like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. That same year, we also acquired Distribution Solutions from Sony Pictures, which got us into the exclusive home video distribution relationships with 20 movie studios, further strengthening our position in the industry and giving us another vendor number with Walmart and Best Buy, and enabling us to become the exclusive seller for these movie studios to Walmart, Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Barnes & Noble, and other retailers in the U.S. and Canada. In 2020, we expanded our video gaming presence with the acquisition of Mecca's compare to COKeM, thus expanding our relationship with Best Buy, Target, Kohls, Dell (NYSE:DELL), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). With the acquisition of COKeM, we also started distributing retro arcade from Arcade1Up, and most recently in 2022, we added collectibles to our portfolio. With the acquisition of Think 3Fold, and move that further diversified our product offering gave us another supplier number with Walmart. As you can see, we have a proven track record of completing acquisitions, and we will continue with that same strategy to further growth and diversify our company moving forward. While we did put ourselves on hold for acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 for our SPAC merger and getting our new three year line of credit in place, we are currently working on four possible future transactions all-in time for our deal pipeline. To better understand what that could mean for Alliance and moving forward, I want to briefly share a case study from our acquisition of Distribution Solutions in 2018. At the time, they were doing around $80 million in revenue working with 18 studios. Fast forward to today, in fiscal 2024, Distribution Solutions accounted for $134 million in revenue, and we're now working with nearly three times the number of studios. As we look at new deals, we continue to apply the same criteria that's worked for us in the past and we're confident this strategy will continue to yield great results. Technology is the backbone of our operations and critical drivers of efficiency, cost savings, and growth. In 2023, we began making strategic investments and automation and technical innovation to enhance our ability to serve our customers more effectively. In January, 2023, we went live with AutoStore automated storage and retrieval system at our Shepherdsville, Kentucky warehouse. I call AutoStore the Rubik’s Cube of auto storage retrieval system. This state-of-the-art system has greatly improved our Kentucky warehouse operations, allowing us to achieve increased levels of speed, reliability, capability, and precision that result in in significant cost savings. With AutoStore, we now process over 2,000 lines per hour with a fraction of the staff. We went from 41 pickers down to seven and receiving went from 14 associates down to eight. Year-over-year, our fulfillment costs are running 1% lower. Because of AutoStore, we eliminated aisles. It created more storage location capacity, enabling us to consolidate operations and close the larger of two buildings in Shakopee, Minnesota, thus removing 162,000 square feet of the 192,000 square feet we had leased there. This closure process, which began in January, was completed on May 31. The savings from this consolidation will positively and permanently impact and reduce our cost structure in fiscal year 2025, further strengthening our ability to operate efficiently and deliver value to our shareholders. In addition, in the Q3 of fiscal 2024, we announced the installation of Sure Sort X system from OPEX, a cutting edge sortation technology that delivered nearly $0.5 million in immediate savings by eliminating need to retrofit older technology and is expected to deliver another nearly $400,000 in annual labor cost savings in our Kentucky facility. In additional cost savings, the Sure X technology has allowed us to handle larger products such as toys and electronics, removing the need for manual sorting and driving new levels of efficiency and precision. In the investor presentation, there are hyperlinks to see AutoStore and OPEX and other processes we do in Kentucky. I will now hand the call over to Alliance's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Walker, my partner. Jeff Walker: Thank you, Bruce, and thank you all for joining us today. We will now turn to an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We generated $236.9 million in net revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $247.1 million in the same period last year. While this represents a modest decline, we saw positive shifts in several key areas that position us well for the future. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was $26.9 million down from $30.2 million in the same quarter last year. This resulted in a gross margin of 11.4%, slightly below the 12.2% achieved in Q4 2023. Although margins tighten, we've taken steps to streamline costs and improve efficiencies, which will be reflected in future quarters. We are pleased to report we delivered net income of $2.5 million for the quarter, a major turnaround from the $4.6 million net loss in the same period last year, an impressive $7.1 million improvement and a clear signal that our focus on operational efficiency is paying off. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $2.1 million our fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Moving on to our full year highlights. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, were $1.1 billion compared to $1.16 billion for fiscal year 2023. Our shift towards higher margin business, including growth in consumer direct shipments is one factor helping to drive improved margins and profitability. Consumer direct shipments increased to 36% of our gross revenue, up from 31% in fiscal 2023. Gross profit for the fiscal year was $128.9 million compared to $103.9 million in the prior year, an impressive 24% increase. This improvement was driven by the combination of shifting product mix and new operational efficiencies. Gross profit margin also saw a substantial boost rising to 11.7%, up from 9% in fiscal 2023, representing a 270 basis point improvement. In addition to the year-over-year growth in our quarterly gross profit, we achieved a significant $21.9 million reduction in operating expenses. A 16% decrease bringing expenses down from $136.7 million to $114.7 million. This reduction was largely driven by the warehouse efficiencies and new technologies we implemented throughout the year. These improvements are not just one-time gains. They will continue to positively impact our cost structure and overall profitability moving forward. Net income for fiscal 2024 was $4.6 million, a $40 million improvement over the $35.4 million net loss in fiscal 2023, underscoring the effectiveness of our ongoing initiatives to improve margins and manage costs. Our adjusted EBITDA tells a similar story improving by $41.9 million to $24.3 million up from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $17.6 million in fiscal 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities surged to $55.8 million in fiscal 2024, up from $3.4 million in the prior year, a remarkable increase of 1,547%. This cash generation strengthens our ability to reinvest in the business and drive future growth. And just to reiterate something Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect significant cost savings in fiscal 2025 from the closing of our Minnesota facility, which was completed in late May. Over the past year, we've also made significant efforts to strengthen our balance sheet, and those efforts are continuing to bear fruit with both inventory and debt continuing to decline year-over-year. Inventory dropped from $147 million to $97 million as of June 30th, 2024, and debt was reduced from $133 million to $73 million. In conjunction with these initiatives, we've secured a new three-year $120 million senior secured asset-based credit facility with White Oak Commercial Finance earlier this year, the proceeds of which was used to refinance the existing credit facility fund working capital needs, and provide for general corporate purposes. These steps have also positioned us to focus and execute on implementing our acquisition strategy going forward. Taking a broader view of our financial performance over the last five fiscal years. This slide showcases how we've navigated a dynamic environment. In fiscal 2020, we generated $776 million in revenue. Over the next two years, a combination of growth initiatives, strategic acquisitions, and an unprecedented surge in demand during COVID-19 pandemic drove our top line to a peak of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. As expected, this demand is normalized with revenues adjusting to around $1.1 billion for fiscal ’23 and ‘24. While adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 was impacted by one time supply chain issues, the significant rebound in fiscal 2024 also reflects the strategic steps we've taken to enhance profitability, including reducing costs and optimizing operations. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 2.2% for fiscal 2024. Turning to our balance sheet. As mentioned a moment ago, our focus on reducing inventory and debt has paid off with inventory levels dropping to $97 million and debt reduced to $73 million as of June 30, 2024. These reductions have streamlined our operations and improved our financial flexibility. As already mentioned, we also expect further cost savings for fiscal 2025, particularly from the closure of our Minnesota facility in May. Additionally, our $120 million asset based credit facility with White Oak, which was secured to support working capital and refinance existing debt, has positioned us well for continued growth and execution of our acquisition strategy going forward. I will now turn the call back over to Bruce. Bruce Ogilvie: Thank you, Jeff. As we look to the future, Alliance Entertainment is poised for continued growth by leveraging our strength as a capital light, low-cost provider with unmatched reach in the industry. Our strategy is clear expand our market share, improve margins, and drive EBITDA growth. First, we see tremendous opportunities to expand into underpenetrated channels, particularly in areas like digital video streaming, where direct vendor selling remains low and cost effective. This is where Alliance can truly shine by offering efficient scalable solution. In fiscal 2024 alone, our exclusive distribution agreement generated over 250 million in sales, and we expect to build on this momentum moving forward. Second, we are investing in automation and restructuring to enhance our operational efficiency. Technologies like AutoStore are already driving significant cost savings, and these improvements will continue to bolster our margins while providing the scalability to capture more market share. Third, mergers and acquisitions remain central to our growth strategy. Through strategic M&A, we plan to rapidly expand our product categories in verticals across music, home video movies, video gaming, toys and collectibles. By doing so, we will not only diversify our offerings, but also strengthen relationships with our major retail partners positioning Alliance for long term success. The opportunities ahead are significant. Family-owned competitors are aging out and large movie studios and companies are looking to sell or license physical media rights. Our capital-light model combined with our proven ability to integrate acquisition sets us apart from the competition. These major movie studios, we lean on Alliance to allow opportunities to license their home video content and allow these major movie studios to focus on their core competency of making movies, exhibiting in theaters, doing premium downloads, and focusing their streaming services. Alliance's core competency is distributing packaged physical media. We are excited about the road ahead, and we're confident that our strategic initiatives will drive future growth and profitability for years to come. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session. Operator? Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from [David Levine] with [Critical Research]. Unidentified Analyst: Great results, really impressive, great turnaround, all that stuff. I'm wondering if you would be willing to comment a little bit on, given all the changes that have been made and some of the positive developments that you are seeing in the business, if it's reasonable to expect, say, adjusted EBITDA in the future quarters and coming years to trend something closer to where you were previously, say, in the 4% and 5% range. Jeff Walker: Hello, David, this is Jeff Walker. I'll answer that there for you. We definitely see our EBITDA trending upwards, and we do believe that we can get back into that 4% to 5% EBITDA goal or target that we've been focused on. That ‘24 was still a year of some cleanup as well as consolidation. So we should definitely see that improving as we're moving into fiscal ‘25 and ‘26. Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to pass it back to Paul Kuntz for any web questions from the webcast. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Paul. Now we are going to turn to the questions coming in from the webcast participants. Our first question was, how will interest rate reductions impact the earnings? Jeff Walker: Thank you, Paul. I'll take this one as well here. We expect to see a very big decline in our interest expense for fiscal ‘26 with our continued debt reduction that we are in the process of today, and continuing through fiscal ‘25 and combining that with potential fed interest rate reductions. That should have a pretty significant impact on our interest cost in fiscal ‘25, but a real significant impact for fiscal ‘26 as well. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you. And our next question, what growth initiatives are Alliance is focused on in fiscal 2025? Jeff Walker: Thank you, Paul. We're really focused intently right now on increasing our exclusive distribution opportunities and video music and collectibles. We definitely mentioned that quite a bit in this statement in our press release here. It's a very important aspect of our business to have the exclusive distribution of products. It really helps us with sales to our retailers and it really drives our business there. We are looking at including, significant video licensing opportunities with our Mill Creek division, and we currently have a significant conversation happening here because of Alliance's extensive distribution capabilities and being great solutions for our partners. So really, our solution has been very successful for the labels and studios that have come to us for exclusive distribution. And part of that is that we have all their inventory in stock and our sales opportunities and sales channels, not only to the brick-and-mortar, but across all e-commerce, selling media products is really our bread-and-butter there for our exclusive vendors, and it's really driving incremental sales for them. Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you. And our next question, collectible sales were down in fiscal 2024. What is the future in them? Jeff Walker: Some of you probably know that are on this call, COVID was fantastic for consumer all consumer products and collectibles were definitely super-hot during COVID with, for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers. We as it was humming along so well, we all really got severely overstocked, and lots of products had to be marked down and sold through with all the major retailers and wholesalers and manufacturers. I think today, the collectible market is in a much better position today. There's just a small amount of excess products still in the pipeline, but nothing like it was a couple of years ago. And when there's a lot of excess product in the pipeline, it really slows down sales for everybody in the category. So, Alliance was not immune to it. We took hits on those that affected our sales and margins, and we've come through this as well. And if you follow Funko, who is definitely a leader in collectibles, they definitely describe the challenges, and going into 2025, the collectible business is definitely normalizing for them and other manufacturers. I will say that the overall collectible industry is very, very robust. Consumers are still loving to collect their favorite products, and so we see we also see more exclusive distribution opportunities for Alliance in collectibles as well as a lot of great acquisition opportunities in the collectibles space that we're in discussions and will be in our acquisition strategy for years to come. Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Jeff. And we had another question. I know you do not provide guidance, but it sounds as if we should be looking for going forward as perhaps limited revenue growth with better gross margins and net margins. Is that a fair assessment? Jeff Walker: Yes, I would say that's a pretty fair assessment. Our overall core business is stable and we might have a small uptick in sales, but really, our growth from overall net revenue is definitely going to come from our acquisition strategy and adding acquisitions to the business. That is how we've grown the company over the last 20 years. And so there's definitely from the acquisition side, we are definitely in some other organic conversations that to bring on some more exclusive distribution, that could drive some growth in our top line revenue. And then, as we mentioned on the call, really continuing to focus on our operational efficiencies will also help to reduce our costs and improve our overall net margins. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Jeff. And we have two related questions to what you're just talking about there. The next one is, can you give any clarity on the offering, filing and your intent to raise cash for future acquisitions? Jeff Walker: Could you repeat that one for me? Unidentified Company Representative : Can you give any clarity on the offering, filing and your intent to raise cash for future acquisitions? Jeff Walker: We did put an S1 filing out earlier this year, and with the intent to raise capital for acquisitions. I think, it's dependent on having a significant acquisition queued up and ready to go. But we're trying to prepare ourselves for all the different options and things that might come our way. Last part on that from an acquisition standpoint, we're very diverse business as we just described. From that diversity that gives us a lot of different acquisition opportunities in all the different categories and divisions and sales channels that we mentioned earlier today. Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Jeff. And looks like we have one more question. What is the expected expense reduction in fiscal 2025 from the closing of the Minnesota warehouse? And is there additional reductions planned? Jeff Walker: We acquired COKeM in September of 2020 and we continue to operate their facilities and so forth through there. The lease was coming due in the main warehouse there at the end of May of ‘24 this year. About a year ago, we started our plan to do that consolidation and so in fiscal ‘24, we still ran that warehouse and that operation, so we did not have much savings in fiscal ‘24. The savings is really coming here as we move into fiscal ‘25, and we're forecasting right about $5 million of operational savings for fiscal ‘25. And obviously going forward from that completed consolidation. And a key aspect on it is not just the rent and the payroll, but one of the key aspects is that we were running on COKeM legacy IT system as well. So the company had alliance's system and COKeM system and being able to retire that legacy system at COKeM does save a huge amount of money, not only maintaining systems and as well as IT team and so forth, and compliance issues and all those different things as a public company. So that's where the significant part of that savings is coming from. We do also have a second smaller facility in Minnesota that was across the street from the big one. It's about 30,000 square feet. The lease is up in September of '25, so a year from now, and we will be exiting that one as our lease comes up. So we'll be working on that next summer. It's not as significant of a savings as the big warehouse that we just completed, but it will be some additional savings there. Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Jeff. And that was the last question we've had come in. Jeff Walker: Okay. Thank you, everybody. We're very excited. We had a fantastic fiscal year and we're pretty excited here going into fourth quarter and the holiday season. Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Monlunabant phase 2a trial in obesity successfully completed

Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:43:00Z

September 20, 2024 08:43 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 September 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from a phase 2a clinical trial with monlunabant, a small molecule oral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) inverse agonist. Monlunabant, formerly INV-202, was part of the acquisition of Inversago Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced in August 2023 [Link]. The trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a once-daily 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of monlunabant compared to placebo on body weight after 16 weeks in 243 people with obesity and metabolic syndrome1. People were equally randomised among the four treatment arms. From a baseline body weight of 110.1 kg, all doses of monlunabant achieved a statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. After 16 weeks of treatment, people treated with a once-daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant achieved a weight loss of 7.1 kg compared to a reduction of 0.7 kg with placebo2. Limited additional weight loss was seen at higher doses of monlunabant. In the trial, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, with the vast majority being mild to moderate and dose dependent. Reporting of mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, primarily anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, was more frequent and dose dependent with monlunabant compared to placebo. No serious adverse events were reported in relation to neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate a larger phase 2b trial in obesity to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant over a longer duration in a global population. The phase 2b trial is expected to be initiated in 2025. About monlunabant and CB1Monlunabant is an inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor which plays an important role in metabolism and appetite regulation in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, pancreas, muscles and lungs. CB1 plays an important role in appetite regulation and cardiometabolic pathways. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

Title: FedEx stock target cut, retains hold rating on 1Q results
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/fedex-stock-target-cut-retains-hold-rating-on-1q-results-93CH-3625468
Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:12:29Z
Full Content:
On Friday, Jefferies made an adjustment to its outlook on FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares, reducing the price target on the company's shares to $275 from the previous $300, while keeping a Hold rating on the stock. The adjustment follows FedEx's recent earnings report, which revealed first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 that fell more than 25% below market expectations. This shortfall was attributed to weaker than anticipated margins in both the Federal Express and Freight segments. According to the financial firm, FedEx's adjusted operating profit saw a year-over-year decline of $380 million, or 24%. This significant drop was noted even though FedEx had realized $1.8 billion in cost savings last year from its DRIVE initiative. The DRIVE program was designed to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs across the company's various business units. The analysis further highlighted that the margin for the Federal Express segment was at its lowest since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The anticipated pressure on the second quarter's performance and a 20% downward revision of first-half EPS estimates have led to skepticism about FedEx's ability to meet the lower end of its EPS guidance for the year. The report from Jefferies suggests caution, indicating that the upcoming second quarter could present additional challenges for FedEx. The company's financial performance in the first half of the fiscal year has prompted a reassessment of its earnings potential, leading to the revised price target. Despite the cost-saving measures implemented by FedEx, the current financial results have not met the expectations set by previous forecasts. In other recent news, FedEx's financial performance has been the subject of various adjustments by financial firms. Susquehanna cut its price target for FedEx to $330, while maintaining a positive rating, following the company's first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025, which missed expectations with an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60. Similarly, Stifel revised its price target for FedEx to $321 from $327, maintaining a buy rating despite the company's underperformance. Baird also adjusted its price target for FedEx, reducing it to $320 from $340, but retained an outperform rating. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley downgraded FedEx stock from Equalweight to Underweight, reducing the price target to $200, citing FedEx's forecasted EPS for fiscal year 2025 as significantly below the guidance provided by FedEx's management. FedEx's first-quarter results showed a shift in the types of shipments it handled, impacting the company's blended yield and leading to higher costs associated with purchased transportation. However, the company's management indicated that cost savings are expected to increase sequentially throughout the year, with revenue management initiatives in place to mitigate the pressure on yields. FedEx is implementing the 'DRIVE' initiative as part of its restructuring plan, aimed at reducing costs and enhancing operational efficiency. These are all recent developments for FedEx, providing insights into the company's performance and strategic initiatives. Following Jefferies' revision of FedEx's price target, it's pertinent to consider additional insights from InvestingPro to gauge the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, FedEx's market capitalization stands at $73.58 billion, with a P/E ratio of 17.26, indicating investor sentiment on its earnings potential. The company has experienced a revenue decline over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, with a -2.73% change, yet it maintains a strong gross profit margin of 27.32%. InvestingPro Tips highlight that FedEx has consistently raised its dividend for the last three years and has maintained dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, showcasing its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, FedEx has shown a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 19.31%, and analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year. These factors underscore FedEx's resilience and the potential for long-term investor confidence. For those seeking further insights, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which provide deeper analysis into FedEx's performance and future outlook (https://www.investing.com/pro/FDX).

Title: Why Did FedEx Stock Fall 13%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/20/why-did-fedex-stock-fall-13/
Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:11:04Z

[+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) saw a 13% fall in after-market hours on Thursday, September 19, after it reported Q1’25 results (fiscal ends in May) far worse than the street estimates. FDX stock is up 7% year-to-date, compared to -15% returns for its peer – UPS stock. FedEx reported revenue of $21.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, well below our estimates of $22.1 billion, and $4.90, respectively. The company’s results were also lower than the consensus estimates of $22.0 billion and $4.83, respectively. Not only did FedEx report a downbeat quarter, it cut its full-year outlook, weighing on its stock. Overall, the performance of FDX stock with respect to the index has been quite volatile in recent years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We now estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, reflecting just 9% upside from its levels of around $260. Our forecast is based on a 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $20.85, broadly aligning with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. FedEx’s Revenue fell 0.5% y-o-y to $21.6 billion in Q1, due to lower express and freight segment sales. The average daily volume was flat y-o-y for the express segment, but the average daily shipments were down 3% for the freight segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 170 bps to 5.6% in Q1’25. This resulted in its bottom line of $3.60 on an adjusted basis, down 21% y-o-y. This dismal performance by FedEx can be attributed to continued weakness in shipping demand. With continued price increases, consumers have become more cautious and are opting for lower priced services. FedEx will also lose the U.S. Postal Service as its client, likely resulting in around a $500 million headwind for the company. Looking forward, FedEx expects a low single-digit rise in total revenues for fiscal 2025, slightly more cautious than its prior outlook of a low to mid-single-digit rise. Although, its focus on cost-cutting initiatives should bode well for the bottom-line growth. FedEx is in the midst of its $4 billion cost-saving efforts by the end of fiscal 2025. Still, it lowered its earnings outlook to now be in the range of $20 and $21 per share, versus $20 and $22 per share earlier. We now forecast the 2025 revenue to be around $89.7 billion, reflecting a 2% y-o-y rise, and adjusted earnings to be $20.85, versus $17.80 in fiscal 2024. While FedEx will likely benefit from its focus on improving margins, the company faces headwinds amid soft demand, which may continue to weigh on its stock performance in the near term. While FDX stock posted a downbeat Q1, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Tech job seekers face hard times as industry resets

Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:09:00Z

The big picture: For decades, having a job in tech meant stability, regular raises, and lucrative perks. However, that has changed, perhaps permanently. The tech labor market is currently in upheaval, with firms letting go of employees by the thousands and tightening hiring requirements when they are looking to fill positions. The only safe space appears to be in AI. Since the start of the year, more than 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020, according to Indeed.com. Companies across the industry spectrum are cutting tech positions, including some of the largest names in the game. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have all downsized this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP, Intel, PayPal, and Cisco. Furthermore, employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, according to Pequity, a compensation-planning startup. Wages have increased by an average of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. This is not new information for those in the industry seeking employment. Last year, over 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs, making 2023 the second-largest year of layoffs on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The market isn't what it once was," Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, told CNBC. "To secure a new position, many salespeople and recruiters are leaving tech entirely. Even engineers are compromising – accepting roles with less stability, a tougher work environment, or lower pay and benefits." The trend doesn't appear to be part of the typical cyclical fluctuations that characterize tech employment, either. The Wall Street Journal recently referred to it as a fundamental reset in an industry that is readjusting its labor needs. Instead of focusing on growth at all costs, companies are now zeroing in on revenue-generating products and services in their hiring strategies. This shift means that sectors that weren't very profitable, such as virtual reality and devices, are facing significant cuts. Tech firms are also scaling back on entry-level hires and eliminating recruiting teams. Companies that are hiring are now looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. Ryan Sutton, executive director of the technology practice group at staffing firm Robert Half, told The Wall Street Journal, "They want to see people who are more versatile." AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, perhaps not surprisingly. Individuals who have worked on large language models can easily find jobs with salaries reaching $1 million a year. AI engineers are being offered two to four times the salary of a regular engineer, according to Pequity CEO Kaitlyn Knopp. "That's an extreme investment of an unknown technology," she said. "They cannot afford to invest in other talent because of that." Tech workers may understandably feel a sense of whiplash from these changes. During the pandemic, firms went on a hiring spree as much of everyday life moved online. Employees were offered generous salaries and significant flexibility as companies competed for talent. Then the economy cooled amid higher interest rates and inflation, leading to large-scale layoffs as companies jettisoned tens of thousands of jobs. However, the current hiring trends are not as closely correlated to the economy as one might think. Nela Richardson, head of ADP Research, told The Wall Street Journal that the past few years represent the natural trajectory of an industry grounded in innovation. "You're not breaking as much new ground in terms of the digital space as in earlier time periods," she said. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: Are Europe’s Too-Big-To-Fail Banks About to Get Even Bigger?

Time Published: 2024-09-20T10:45:44Z
Full Content:
As two potential big bank mergers — both hostile, one cross-border — hang in the balance, Mario Draghi and the editorial boards of the FT and Bloomberg call for a fresh round of European bank consolidation. The last time two large banks merged in Europe was in March 2023, when a reluctant UBS took over its failing domestic rival, Credit Suisse. The fast-moving fallout from the bank collapses in the US had tipped the chronically mismanaged Credit Suisse over the edge. The resulting shotgun merger was Europe’s first ever tie-up between two officially Too-Big-to-Fail lenders, and while it may have steadied the ship, for now, it also served as a timely reminder that, to quote Satyajit Das, strong capital and liquidity ratios count for little when panicked depositors take flight. Fast forward to today, two proposed bank mergers — both hostile, one cross-border — hang in the balance. In the first, Italy’s second largest bank, Unicredit, is looking to take over Germany’s second largest, Commerzbank. Both lenders were in dire straits just a few years ago, with Unicredit even losing its status as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), but appear to have more or less stabilised since then. In the second, Spain’s second largest bank, BBVA, seeks to buy out its domestic rival, Banco Sabadell. Thinning the Herd Both mergers have been tried before, with no success, but that doesn’t prevent them from being tried again. In the case of BBVA’s proposed takeover of Sabadell, it faces strong opposition from the national government in Madrid, but it has received the blessing of the European Central Bank, which has long favoured thinning the herd of banking players in the Euro Area. For its part, Unicredit has solicited ECB approval to own up to 30% of Commerzbank, potentially triggering a full buyout deal. The answer from the ECB is likely to be “yes”. Senior ECB representatives have persistently sought to reduce the number of small and mid-sized banks in the Euro Area. In September 2017, Daniele Nouy, the then-Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board, partly blamed the low profitability of large lenders on the fierce competition from smaller banks. Rather than lots of competition between domestic banks, what Europe needs, Nouy said, are “brave banks” that are willing to traverse borders and conquer new territory. Current ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos recently reiterated this position: “We are looking for an integrated European market, we lack the single deposit guarantee fund, which we are in favour of. And I think that the less cracked and fragmented the system is, in terms of national barriers, the more economies of scale can increase, boosting competition. Having large European banks is a fundamental part of this. European integration is stagnant and I think this would help spur it along.” It may just do that, but the consequences are likely to be dire for Europe’s sclerotic economies. As the German economist and small bank activist Richard Werner warns, economies with fewer and bigger banks will lend less and less to small firms, which tends to mean that productive credit creation that produces jobs, prosperity and no inflation, also declines, and credit creation for asset purchases, causing asset bubbles, or credit creation for consumption, causing inflation, become more dominant.” In other words, more financialisation, less productive activity. In the eurozone, more than 5,000 banks have already disappeared since the ECB started business a little over two decades ago, according to Werner. And the central bank is determined to continue, if not intensify, this process. In his recent report for the Commission on the state of EU competitiveness, former ECB Governor Mario Draghi blames European banks’ lower profitability and lending capacity vis-a-vis their US counterparts on their lack of scale. And the main reason for that lack of scale, he says, is “the [EU’s] incomplete Banking Union.” The document argues that “a minimal step towards completing the Banking Union would be to create a separate jurisdiction for European banks with substantial cross-border operations that would be ‘country blind’ from the regulatory, supervisory and crisis management viewpoints.” In other words, a partial banking union for the EU’s largest cross-border lenders. According to Bloomberg columnist Paul j Davies, “It’s a minimal reform that would need single, EU-level deposit insurance and resolution schemes for just the top 20 or so lenders”. The idea already enjoys the full-throated support of Bloomberg and the FT. In an op-ed on Wednesday, Bloomberg‘s editorial board averred that “UniCredit’s Takeover Bid Should Be Welcomed by Europe.” Such a merger, they claim, could pave the way to “the financial union both Germany and Europe desperately need,” creating a bank that will be among the largest on the continent, with a bigger balance sheet and domestic revenues than Deutsche bank. Faced with such a threat, Deutsche Bank has threatened to buy up part or all of the German State’s remaining shares of Commerzbank. 🇩🇪 A combination of UniCredit and Commerzbank would create a European banking giant that would rank ahead of Deutsche Bank in terms of German revenue and will also surpass it in total assets Officially, there is at the moment no firm timeline for the merger talks between the… pic.twitter.com/Awl8Vqb4Jk — Nikolay Kolarov, CFA (@libertniko) September 17, 2024 For its part, the FT published an editorial calling on Europe to “unleash its banking union”: Unicredit’s announcement last week that it had built up a 9 per cent stake in Commerzbank sparked a rare giddiness among European bank watchers. In the continent’s highly fragmented banking system, mergers are often confined to entities from the same country and lending activity is largely home-biased. Onlookers hoped the Italian bank’s move could pave the way for a deeper tie-up between Italy and Germany’s second-largest listed lenders, and kick-start consolidation across the bloc. Former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s report into Europe’s economy estimated last week that the bloc needed to raise capital expenditure by €800bn a year to remain competitive. But a significant impediment to boosting investment is the lack of scale among the EU’s private lenders. For measure, JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, has a market capitalisation greater than the 10 largest EU banks taken together. In the banking industry, size matters. Larger banks can spread risk and benefit from cost efficiencies, which helps to generate higher profits and, in turn, more financing opportunities. The US’ banking system seems a bizarre choice of example to follow — unless, of course, seen from the perspective of Europe’s big bank executives. After all, nowhere else on planet Earth have banks reached such levels of economic heft and impunity. Profits and pay have done nothing but rise, even through Wall Street-inspired financial crises that have destroyed trillions of dollars of value and untold millions of jobs around the world. The mention of JPMorgan Chase is also interesting given the role the bank appears to have played in facilitating Unicredit’s allegedly unwelcome bid for Commerzbank. The US lender had been hired by the German government to help organise an auction of part of the stake the State held in Commerzbank. But apparently unbeknown to Berlin, JPM had invited Unicredit to participate in the auction, giving the Milan-based lender an opportunity to get its foot in the door. Unicredit took full advantage, buying up 100% of the State’s 4.5% stake. From the FT: The sale on Tuesday in an after-hours auction enabled UniCredit to jump to a 9 per cent stake without previously disclosing any interest — something that could have pushed up the price. The sudden move to become Commerzbank’s second-biggest shareholder — behind the government with its remaining 12 per cent — caught the German establishment off-guard, ignited public opposition to the sale of a strategic asset and put Berlin in an awkward position ahead of federal elections next year. Before this month, Berlin repeatedly signalled to UniCredit and European rivals circling Commerzbank that it was not interested in selling to them. Instead, it wanted to sell its stake in small portions to financial investors, according to people familiar with the deliberations, but EU bailout rules barred it from discriminating against strategic bidders… The Italian bank, headed by experienced dealmaker Andrea Orcel, had by the time of the auction on Tuesday accumulated a 4.5 per cent stake through derivative transactions that fell below the threshold for disclosure. In other words, Unicredit has surreptitiously accumulated 9% of Commerzbank’s stock, at a reasonably low price, and now appears to intent on acquiring a controlling stake in the bank. “For the moment, we are only a shareholder. But a merger … could lead to considerable added value for all stakeholders,” Unicredit CEO Andrea Orcel told Handelsblatt. The Germany government insists it was blindsided by Unicredit’s moves, but opposition parties and trade unions are fuming — for good reason: Commerzbank has more than 42,000 staff, 25,000 business customers, many of them belonging to Germany’s celebrated Mittelstand – the mid-sized companies that are considered the cornerstone of the economy — and is responsible for almost a third of German foreign trade payments. Back to the FT: On Monday, Matthias Hauer, a head of the opposition CDU/CSU group on the parliamentary finance committee, urged the government “to dispel the suspicion that it has lost control of the sales process”.“ Given the importance of Commerzbank for (Germany’s) financial centre, it is important that strategic interests are taken into account,” Hauer added. Fabio De Masi, an MEP for new far-left opposition party Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht, said: “Since the global financial crisis, we have known that there is stupid German money but now we have learnt that there are also stupid German ministries. “It beggars belief that decision makers in Berlin accidentally kick off a banking merger,” he added.” Given how much damage the Olaf Sholtz government has already inflicted on the German economy in just three years, none of this should beggar belief, including the possibility that the government intentionally opened the door to Commerzbank’s sell-off. A few months ago, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would be perfectly happy for a bank from another European country to buy up a French one (the interviewer offered the example of Santander merging with Société Générale). “It’s part of the market,” he said. “But (above all because) acting as Europeans means that it is necessary to consolidate as Europeans.” Madrid vs ECB Meanwhile in Spain, BBVA, Europe’s ninth largest bank by assets, is determined to expand its share of the Spanish market by taking over the smallest of Spain’s big four lenders, Banco Sabadell. BBVA announced its latest bid in May, which was rejected outright not only by Sabadell’s management but also by the Spanish government. BBVA responded by taking the bid hostile, placing itself at loggerheads not only with Sabadell’s management but also Spain’s Pedro Sánchez government. As an op-ed in Euro Money reports, “hostile bank M&A deals are rare, especially in Europe, as they make due diligence so much harder”: Given the power of regulators in banking, if a host government so much as hints at its opposition, acquirors will often back off. But there are examples of successful hostile bank M&A deals in the sector: most recently Intesa San Paolo’s takeover of UBI Banca. Bankers on both sides of the BBVA-Sabadell deal say that once a bid like this is launched, the state has less influence over the situation unless there are compelling competition or prudential reasons to block it. The Spanish government insists that is the case. Spain’s banking industry, it says, is already concentrated enough, with the four biggest lenders — Banco Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank, and Sabadell — controlling around 70% of the retail banking space. Before the 2008 financial crisis, the country was home to 45 savings banks and a dozen commercial banks. Now there are barely ten large or mid-size lenders left. A BBVA-Sabadell tie up would not only further erode competition in an already heavily concentrated financial sector, with all the ugly implications that entails (including more cartel-like behaviour, higher risks of big bank implosions, and the inevitable closure of even more bank branches and ATMs, making accessing cash even harder, just as the big banks intend), it is also likely to impact the banking services available to small businesses. After all, Sabadell is Spain’s largest lender to small and medium-size enterprises. “We are talking about excessive concentration within this sector and this has potential effects for customers, for example, in how their deposits are remunerated,” said Carlos Cuerpo, Spain Minister of Economy, at an event on Friday. The minister recalled that over the past two years the ECB’s sharp rise in interest rates has not led to a commensurate rise in deposit rates, as it did on previous occasions: “The Bank of Spain itself points out that, in part, this is due to a possible absence of competition or excessive concentration, and this is before an additional merger between two of the large Spanish banks takes place.” While the Spanish governments faces off with BBVA over its attempted hostile takeover of Sabadell, executives at Sabadell insist that BBVA’s current bid offers little value to its shareholders. Many of its (largely Catalan) retail shareholders, who hold just under half of the bank’s stock, are also against the proposed merger. In an effort to frustrate BBVA’s designs, Sabadell is refusing to disclose not only the non-public information that BBVA has requested to draft the prospectus of the hostile takeover but also data that it has willingly disclosed for years, including the proportion of shares held by individual and institutional shareholders. To go ahead, the operation will also need the approval of Spain’s market and competition regulators, which could take months to materialise. The Obstacles to Big Bank Mergers As already mentioned, both of these proposed mergers have already been attempted before, with nothing to show for it. As even the FT notes, there are multiple reasons why bank mergers fail, particularly in the Euro Area: European governments that had to bail out international lenders during the crisis have been more cautious about cross-border mergers. [NC: What the FT doesn’t mention is that some of the big banks created by cross-border mergers during the pre-crisis years were among the biggest casualties during the crisis — including, of course, RBS and Monte dei Paschi di Senna, both of which are still heavily state-owned.] There is often also a desire to support domestic champions and to protect provincial banking networks. Banks attempting to expand beyond their national borders also have to navigate reams of red tape, including differences in tax, accounting and insolvency regimes, labour laws, and securities markets. This helps to explain why both cross-border lending and mergers are subdued. European banking authorities have a reputation for being more restrictive than their international peers, too. Another thing the FT doesn’t mention are the IT challenges of making cross-border mergers work. As we have discussed here on a number of occasions, merging two banks’ often creaking IT systems can be a nightmare. One of the best examples of this, ironically, was Sabadell’s bungled attempt to merge its “state-of-the-art” IT system with that of its recently acquired British subsidiary, TSB. From out Dec 3, 2020 post, This Is What Can Happen When a Cross-Border Bank Merger Goes Horribly Wrong: Branded the “biggest IT disaster in British banking history,” the botched IT upgrade led to hundreds of thousands of customers being unable to access their online accounts for weeks on end. Standing orders, payrolls, mortgage instalments and other payments and transfers failed. Thousands of customers fell victim to fraud attacks. Even when the bank tried to apologize, it sent apologies out to the wrong people, in the process breaking the EU’s new data protection laws. As our in-house bank IT specialist Clive commented for that post, “while central banks and regulators may see the upsides in bank mergers, perhaps as stealth recapitalisations for failed or failing institutions, or an attempt to create larger entities to compete on the global stage (notwithstanding how many times that has been shown to be little more than a pipe dream) or even to try to keep all their problems in one place to better keep an eye on them, few have any real knowledge of experience of what a bank merger entails as a practical exercise.” This is one of many reasons why cross-border bank mergers tend to fail so badly, particularly in Europe — often with extortionate repercussions. Orcel should know this better than just about anyone given his previous role as architect of some of the worst European bank marriages during his time at Bank of America – including RBS’s catastrophic takeover of ABN Amro and Monte dei Paschi di Siena’s disastrous acquisition of Antonveneta, which culminated in the failure and bailout of both RBS and MPS, the costs of which are still being paid today. Thank you, Nick. You mention ABN AMRO. That is still half owned by the Dutch government and a shadow of its former self. The Dutch government is looking at reducing its stake. A new CEO is expected next year. One wonders if the bank will find itself in play. ABN-AMRO was loaded up on Russian Oligarch loans and clearly found the Bigger Fool in Fred Goodwin to offload these negative assets onto RBS balance sheet It seems that the EU wants to push for the development of what could eventually be a “Eurobank” which would have the financial resources to compete with the big boys. But with great size come great risk. If this Eurobank screwed up and needs a bailout by the EU, what if by that time the financial resources of the EU cannot really do it. Not so much Too Big To Fail as Too Big To Bailout. But fortunately for the EU they have their tools. They could do a bail-in of ALL bank customers in the EU like they did in Cyprus. Lock people out of their bank accounts and use a big chunk of customer’s deposits to bail out that bank. In return customers would get an IOU or a piece of equity or some such garbage. Of course if by then the EU has switched over to digit currency, then this could all be done with a few keystrokes and I am sure by then the EU would have the legislation in place to allow them to do it. Too big to fail: letting the bank go bankrupt would ruin the economy. Too big to jail: even if the problems were caused by illegal shenanigans, members of its management are too influential and bringing them to account would ruin the confidence amongst economic actors. Too big to sail: even if the financial situation is all right, the number of subsidiaries, business sectors, subdivisions resulting from acquisitions, and legacy operations makes it impossible to know what is really happening and turns the IT into a giant, intractable labyrinth. Too big to bail: even if the government is ready to do everything to avert a bankruptcy, the financial institution has grown too large for the State budget and even for the GDP of the country — and for European-scale banks, for the EU budget. The commonality: “too big“. Those cross-border mergers amongst giants are a terrible idea. Thinking about it, I wonder whether such mega-mergers are not a leading indicator of an incoming financial crisis, just like the construction of huge skyscrapers have been shown to be an indicator of a real-estate bubble on the cusp of bursting. And please, people, it is Monte dei Paschi. I might have missed it but I cannot recollect any discussion of Basel III on this site. Any thoughts on how that might be driving these merger attempts? Thank you. The latest update to Basel III do require more capital, but also greater granularity in data collection and reporting, so big IT and administrative expenditure. That is a factor, but not that much. There’s an obsession in EU officialdom and media, EU and anglosphere, but not so much in political circles, especially domestic ones, for a consolidation of EU firms and the single market. Bigger is better, even if it’s rotten to the core. Amazing how “…the more economies of scale can increase, boosting competition.” I would appreciate it if the pols would at least have the courtesy to stand on their heads when they proclaim that the promotion of widespread monopolies will increase competition…and the stenographer class mindlessly prints this nonsense. And now we have the insufferable VdL ushering Margrethe Vestager out the door saying that the EU must be, “…more supportive of companies scaling up in global markets.” So, now the zombies appear to be eating one another. Will someone at least put Monte dei Pacshi di Siena out of its misery? Please. Siemens competes with GE yet is 40% size. Then companies like Samsung or Hitachi or Huawei are competitors There are huge companies emerging from Asia way bigger than European companies and having huge scale There is some logic in what EU is saying though I doubt they really understand what needs to be done I suspect that cross-border due diligence can be tricky. Loans are loans but the enforcement/collection of loans depend on national legislation and national courts. I know for a fact that the difference between collecting on a loan in Sweden and in Ireland is huge. Even being aware of the difference does not mitigate the risk of incorrect valuations. Foreign banks, even culturally similar UK, have little to no interest in the Irish market. Possibly due to the difficulty of assessing how much a loan is worth in a different legislative market. & things like this: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0910/1469353-former-swedbank-chief-executive-jailed-for-swindling/ Might indicate some other difficulties in managing cross-border banking. Therefore I’d say that an integrated European market for banks might still be far off (at least I hope that it is far off). I guess I don’t get out enough. It had never occurred to me there is no ‘fund’ to guarantee EU bank deposits. So how does it work in Europe? How can banks function without guaranteed deposits? €100,000 per retail bank deposit customer at National level We should be aware the EU customer bank guarantee of 100.000 € is only a promise and not real money put aside in a fund i.e. If a bank holiday suddenly appears in a bankcrisis be aware your investment-holdings deposited at your bank is at risk due to the rules of UCC. The bail-in rules in the EU will not keep your non-cash assets safe. They are subjected to rehypothecation without your knowledge or your borrowing against them. I think that is the same case in US and U.K. banks You stated „investment“ which is not covered by deposit insurance – only bank accounts are and there is no fund anywhere to cover the guarantee even in USA There is no money to insure every home should it burn down either Bank Deposit Insurance prevented US S&L Crisis and no fetailbanks failed in USA – after all Prudence prevailed in US retail banking Corporate deposits are not insured Sorry Paul, my reply was accidently listed at 7:51 below. Why the urge of creating big European actors? To be competitive against (American) big boys? Well, usually when European players succeed and prevail, then Washington is not very happy and eventually accidents like Nord Stream spontaneously occur. To create a deep European Capital Market with banks under EU control not nation state to fund Sovereign EU State Deep European Capital Market sounds like a nice name for a Ponzi scheme. Invest now! US has deep and wide capital markets which allows US corporates to fund themselves in Dollar Bond Markets whereas EU corporations do not have access to a Euro Corporate Bond market of comparable scale even with 550 million inside the EU Marketplace There is no EU Stock Market and these are the areas Draghi is still hankering after Maybe those forms of Capitalism are no longer viable and US will find a De-Dollarised World shrinks its own Capital/Bond Markets – we shall see Commerzbank problem is down to Paul Achleitner, ex-Goldman and ex-Bain, who as CFO at Allianz dreamed of Bancassurance and bought Dresdner Bank with its SME lending portfolio After mis-managing Dresdner it was offloaded onto Commerzbank crippling it. Achleitner skipped off to Deutsche Bank HVB was bought by UniCredito advised by Merrill banker who later became CEO of UniCredito and came for Commerzbank to merge with HVB I think i.e swedish banks pays a very small yearly fee to the government only to kind of manifest that there are “some” real money in case of insolvency. Bail-ins in the EU is probably going to do work they hope! Banks are extremely close interconnected and rehypothecation is the problem in case of severe failure in i.e the derivative markets. That is why our stocks&bonds are not secured in our names. Property-rights have been “sold out” by our politicians since the 90s. Until early 90s I could register my securities held at custody in my own name on the security itself and deposit them in a bank depositbox. Out of reach from the “grabbers”. You can not compare fire-insurance risks on your house with the financial system risks. Banks are domino’s due to their interbank-market dependancy. Fires are not. In the insurance business mutual conservative risktaking has been pretty low but the bankingcartell is doing their best to take over, unfortunately. I invite you to review AIG and its CDS run out of London which contradicts your view of insurers. In addition look at how much insurance companies park in Buyout Funds and Alt Investments – conservative they are not The point about fire is simply statistical probability. No government anticipates all banks going down simultaneously. US backstopped US banking with US Treasury which is funny in that it is a circularity via Black Rock If you listen to Jeffrey Sachs dumbfound Tucker Carlson by relating how Hank Paulson destroyed Lehman by refusing government aid to facilitate Barclays acquiring it – such that the British Government told Barclays to walk away – that Paulson let Lehman go bust to punish it for slighting Goldman – and how Paulson was ignorant of British Bankruptcy Law – Lehman having swept cash out of London on Friday before filing in NY left the UK operation without cash on Monday morning which is definition of Bankruptcy in English Law – thus ended Lehman No insurance compensates for Paulson Your email address will not be published.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis.

Amazon's prestige push, China's slowdown and the rise of TikTok are all factors at play. Senior Editor, Beauty As the beauty landscape shape shifts around the world — Amazon ascendant, China decelerating, TikTok dominating and new consumers emerging — the beauty jobs market is evolving accordingly. Companies both established and emerging are reconfiguring their workforces to better meet the demands of these fast-changing times, whether reshaping certain departments, opting for more agility with a fractional model or restructuring. “The bottom line is simplify to amplify,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen. “Part of that is managing for speed and agility.” Related Articles Beauty Features Inspired by TikTok, E.l.f. Cosmetics and Caboodles Launch a Purse Just for Lip Treatments Beauty Features Why Pheromone Perfumes for Men and Women Are Beating Out Other Fragrances on Amazon For many larger players, this changing landscape involves some component of restructuring, with layoffs in certain areas of the business even as others are enhanced. “The intention is to maximize profitability, given the China slowdown, and also even just a touch of overall slowdown in this market as well,” said Cassie Cowman, a cofounder of View From 32, a beauty consultancy that works with both founders and investors. “Companies are figuring out how to structure these teams to maximize that,” she added. “I have some clients that are still seeing decent traffic, for example, but the conversion is very low or maybe the dot-com channel is suffering. So, how are they investing more in the brick-and-mortar business to maximize that channel while it’s seeing strong momentum?” Unilever has unveiled a “comprehensive productivity program,” involving 7,500 office-based layoffs globally to achieve total cost savings of around 800 million euros over the next three years. British media outlets have reported that, as part of the layoff plan, it is set to cut a third of all office roles in Europe by the end of 2025, or around 3,200 roles. In February, The Estée Lauder Cos. revealed a restructuring plan, including layoffs, as it continues to tread water amid struggles in Asia and at home. It’s part of the wider Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, designed to make the company more agile. The owner of Clinique, Mac, Tom Ford and others will reduce its 62,000-strong global workforce by between 3 and 5 percent as part of the plan, the equivalent of as many as 3,100 jobs. This will be carried out over the next two-and-a-half years. That same month, Shiseido introduced a new business plan within which it is offering an early retirement plan to approximately 1,500 employees in Japan to help bolster group growth and profitability. The move is part of an overarching vision. “To achieve sustainable growth, Shiseido Japan will concentrate its activities on brands, products and touchpoints with high growth potential and profitability, strengthening brand and touchpoint strategy,” the company said. Dyson is also cutting around 1,000 jobs in the U.K., roughly one-third of its U.K. workforce, due to what the company has described as “fierce” global competition. At L’Oréal U.S., WWD understands that there has been some restructuring in the consumer products division, resulting in around 40 job losses. These are omni shopper roles, the link between the marketing and sales teams. Sales leads for brands are also being moved to retail leads. In a WARN notice filed in New York last month, No7 Beauty company said that 64 workers at its Manhattan office would be affected by an office closure. “To enhance our ability to invest in the growth of No7 Beauty Company in the U.S., we are restructuring our organization to work more closely within our own retail partners,” said a spokesman. “Moving forward, we will no longer occupy a small number of desks in a shared office space in New York, and most of our team members are being relocated.” Its parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance has made several rounds of layoffs. Most recently, LVMH-owed Sephora announced plans to cut its workforce in China by 3 percent, the equivalent to around 120 roles, “in response to the challenging market environment” there. As for what roles companies are hiring, Lisa Mare Ringus, executive vice president of global client strategy and growth at 24 Seven Inc, noted that there has been interest in specific sales roles such as supporting Amazon, social and content, finance and marketing. “We’ve seen more hiring in finance this year than ever before within beauty,” Ringus said. Others have seen a spike in searches for brand chief merchandising officers, as well as sales chiefs and chief commercial officers, also sometimes called chief revenue officers. And of course, those with knowledge of AI and TikTok are increasingly in demand. “It’s also about the new skill set,” said Chen. “When you hire someone they’re going to be much better at AI and use TikTok regularly. You need new people who can engage new customers.” In addition to the strategics, the MLM market has also been changing, resulting in job losses. Rodan + Fields has unveiled a new business model, eliminating about 100 roles. Starting Sept. 1, the company moved away from a multilevel direct-selling model to a new affiliate program, which will be supported by a broader array of marketing and advertising across traditional channels and social media. Struggling Beautycounter has also cut jobs, but as of now, it is not known how many staffers were impacted. Its two freestanding stores in New York and Denver will close as it evaluates its retail strategy. But while some companies are restructuring, some smaller brands are rethinking the way they approach C-suite hiring. Take skin care brand Eighth Day, which is backed by L Catterton. CEO Savannah Sachs has been implementing some fractional C-suite roles for myriad reasons. “There’s been an interesting evolution around the idea of freelance or part-time talent, especially at the executive level. The shift is more than just a rebrand from consulting to fractional. It’s indicative of how that type of part-time leadership role has evolved to be more impactful,” she said. “Rather than consulting when it’s implied that you’re working on the business, but not in the business, a fractional leadership role is one where they’re helping set strategy and also helping execute in a much more integrated way with the existing team, and so it’s more impactful. It feels more dedicated,” she continued. “Yet at the same time, the earlier stage brand or start-up business can sort of punch above their weight in terms of the level of senior talent they can bring in and afford, and it also allows the executive to see across maybe a few different businesses.” Cowman is seeing this, too. “I’m advising some of my brand clients as well, to do that. It’s always really beneficial when these younger brands can bring in top level talent early on.” From the executive side, Ringus said that there are more unemployed beauty executives currently than in recent years amid a backdrop of fewer available positions and increased competition for those roles. “It’s really hard if you’re trying to find a job and you’re over $400,000/$500,000,” she said. “It’s a combination of the availability of the talent, and then their willingness to look at other opportunities, and then the demand for some of these smaller to midsized brands, with bringing in expertise that they need and the bench of talent that they need, but they’re often not ready to make that hiring commitment at those types of salary levels.” Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.

Exposure to Key Canadian Themes & IndustriesCanadian companies are amongst the world leaders across the real estate, financial, energy and power sectors. Historical Performance Performance Since Inception to 30 June 2024 Sources: Middlefield, Bloomberg. As at 30 June 2024. Past performance is not a guide to the future. The price of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the full amount invested. All price information is indicative only. Responsibility Statement We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: By order of the Board Michael Phair Andrew ZychowskiChairman Audit Committee Chair Date: 19 September 2024 Chairman’s Statement It is my pleasure to present the Half- Yearly Financial Report for the period ended 30 June, 2024 for Middlefield Canadian Income PCC (“MCT” or the “Company”) and its closed-ended cell, Middlefield Canadian Income – GBP PC (the “Fund”). The Fund invests primarily in dividend- paying Canadian equities, with the objective of providing shareholders with a high level of dividend as well as capital growth over the longer term. Investment Performance The Fund had good relative performance in the first half of 2024 (H1). It generated total returns of 4.6 per cent on its share price and 1.9 per cent on net assets, which are both higher than the benchmark total return of 0.3 per cent. Financials, Energy and Utilities were all positive contributors primarily due to sector allocation and stock selection gains. The Investment Manager believes that H1 represents the early stages of a sustained period of outperformance relative to the benchmark following a period of challenging market conditions for the Fund’s core sectors. The Board has regular contact with the Investment Manager, Middlefield Limited, to discuss broad strategy and review its investment approach, gearing and sector allocations. We remain satisfied that the Investment Manager is applying the strategy consistently and professionally and are confident that the Investment Manager’s outlook and the Fund’s corresponding positioning will deliver good performance over time. Investment Management Middlefield Limited, the Fund’s Investment Manager, has over 40 years of investing experience in the Canadian market. The Investment Manager uses an actively managed strategy, allowing it to take advantage of market dislocations. Given the high levels of cash flow and dividends that Canadian equities offer, and the valuation discounts at which they trade relative to U.S. companies, the Board remains supportive of the Investment Manager’s decision to maintain a significant geographic exposure to Canada. The ability to tactically overweight or underweight certain sectors as market dynamics evolve is an important element of the Fund’s active management strategy.Fund Sector Weights Compared to Benchmark as at 30 June 2024 Source: Middlefield, Bloomberg The background to the Fund’s performance is explained in depth by Mr Dean Orrico in the Investment Manager’s accompanying report. Share Rating and Buybacks The Fund’s share register continues to be supported by long-term institutional shareholders. In May 2024, the Fund’s lead portfolio managers, Dean Orrico and Rob Lauzon, met with many existing and prospective investors on a roadshow organized by Kepler Partners and Investec in London and surrounding regions. This included an exclusive event featuring the CEO of Enbridge Inc., a C$100 billion market capitalisation company and the Fund’s largest position. The Board also believes that enhancing the Fund’s profile with retail investors will increase demand for the stock. Towards this aim, the Investment Manager publishes comprehensive and insightful Fund monthly commentaries which are distributed to 700 existing and prospective investors, many of which have subscribed to these communications on MCT’s website. Direct retail investors are estimated to currently represent 24 per cent of the shareholder register, and the Investment Manager is focusing its efforts on growing that percentage over time. The Fund’s share price discount to NAV narrowed slightly from 16.8 per cent at 31 December 2023 to 15.0 per cent at 30 June 2024. Against a backdrop of a reducing interest rate environment and improving performance, the share price discount had further reduced to 12.4 per cent as at 18 September 2024. The Investment Manager and the Broker monitor the Fund’s share price and discount on a daily basis and the Board regularly considers the level of the Fund’s discount rating. Given the Fund’s positive performance year to date and the Investment Manager’s constructive outlook for the portfolio’s holdings for the rest of 2024 and beyond, the Company has since 28 August 2024 purchased for cash 40,000 Fund Shares, in aggregate to be held in treasury. In assessing whether to conduct buybacks, the Board will continue to consider the magnitude of the Fund’s share price discount and the benefits to shareholders that may be gained from the Company buying back its own shares, in conjunction with market factors, the discount ratings of comparable funds, and the size of the Company and the shrinkage in its asset base which necessarily results from the Company repurchasing its own shares. Gearing The Fund reports its gearing relative to net and total assets in its monthly fact sheet. Gearing relative to total assets was consistent throughout H1. This compares to the Fund’s upper limit of being able to borrow up to 25 per cent of its total assets at the time of drawdown. Net gearing, which represents borrowings as a percentage of net assets, is the AIC standard measure of gearing. Net gearing at the start of the year was 17.1 per cent and ended the period on 30 June 2024 at 18.3 per cent. The cost of borrowing has also come down in 2024. The Board continues to believe the use of gearing is warranted at prevailing interest rates due to an expected total return that exceeds total borrowing costs. The Board will continue to weigh the benefits of gearing against the associated risks and costs and monitors the spread between interest expenses and the yield of the portfolio to ensure the use of leverage remains in the best interests of shareholders. Earnings and Dividends In light of the excess earnings generated by the Fund in 2023, together with the prospect of dividend growth from the underlying portfolio, the Board approved a 0.1p increase in the annual dividend target in early 2024. Two quarterly interim dividends each of 1.325p per share were paid on 31 January 2024 and 30 April 2024, representing a 2% increase to quarterly payments made in the previous financial year. A further quarterly dividend of 1.325p was paid on 31 July post the half year end. Consistent dividend growth is a core consideration for the Fund’s security selection process and factored into the Board’s decision to increase the dividend. The Company’s revenue earnings per share totalled 2.80p for the six months ended 30 June 2024, reflecting a dividend coverage ratio of 1.06. This compares to dividend coverage ratios of 1.09 in 2023 and 1.16 in 2022. The dividend coverage ratio was impacted by a higher interest cost of borrowing which has started to reduce post the half year end with the Bank of Canada reducing interest rates. These figures are targets only and do not constitute, nor should they be interpreted as, a profit forecast. The Board regularly reviews the Fund’s dividend coverage and, subject to the legal requirements of the Companies’ Law, market conditions, as well as the Fund’s earnings, it will continue to consider whether further dividend increases are warranted in the future. Related Party Transactions The Company’s related parties are its directors and the Investment Manager. There were no related party transactions (as defined in the Listing Rules) during the year under review, nor up to the date of this report.Details of the remuneration paid to the directors and the Investment Manager during the period under review are shown in note 13. Material Events The Board is not aware of any significant event or transaction which occurred between 1 July 2024 and the date of publication of this statement which could have a material impact in the financial position of the Fund. Company and Fund Annual General Meetings At each of the Company and Fund’s Annual General Meetings held on 13 June 2024, all resolutions, relating to both ordinary business and special business, were duly passed on a poll. Board Composition and Succession Planning In keeping with the high standards of corporate governance, the Board regularly considers future succession. In recent years, we have experienced significant Board refreshment, with several retirements and new appointments.The Board now comprises five non-executive directors, of whom four are independent and 40% are female, including the senior independent director. Contact Shareholders can write to the Company at its registered office or by email to the Secretary at middlefield.cosec@jtcgroup.com. Principal Risks and Uncertainties Geopolitical tensions are high in several regions around the world, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the South China Sea. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for more than two years and has resulted in Russia being isolated from a significant portion of the global economy. The war between Israel and Hamas, which started in October 2023, has the risk of spilling over into a broader conflict between Israel and its allies and Iranian-backed groups. The conflict has reached points of direct conflict between the two nations, including a situation where Iran fired over 300 missiles and drones directly at Israel for the first time in history. These actions resulted in direct retaliation by Israel against Iran and its proxies. These conflicts have the potential to further disrupt trade relationships, supply chains, capital flows and equity market behaviour. Considering U.S. Congress passed a $95 billion foreign aid package in April 2024, we do not expect any material de-escalation in the near-term. Although inflation has come down in recent months, it still remains above central bank targets in most regions. This has caused central banks to adopt restrictive monetary policies by raising the cost of borrowing and slowing the pace of bond purchases. While restrictive monetary policy helps to combat inflation, it could lead to risks and consequences if it is maintained for too long. These include a significant reduction in consumer spending, high unemployment, lower profit margins from higher borrowing costs and market volatility. Most central banks are expected to be finished hiking rates. There is, however, uncertainty as to the pace and timing of monetary easing. The Bank of Canada cut interest rates in June, July, and September 2024, causing its currency to depreciate relative to GBP and the U.S. dollar. While the subsequent rate cut by the European Central Bank and Bank of England in July partially mitigated the Canadian dollar’s depreciation, the initial impact of the Bank of Canada’s actions remains evident. Unsynchronized monetary policies from global central banks could lead to outsized movements in currencies as capital flows are typically attracted to countries with more restrictive policies. This can lead to supply/demand imbalances for government bonds and affect corporate earnings for companies with international operations. 2024 is an unusually busy year for elections. So far, new leaders have been elected in the U.K., Mexico, Iran and Pakistan while incumbent leaders in France and India have weakened positions of power in their respective countries. The United States will hold its Presidential election in November 2024, while Canada is expected to hold an election no later than October 2025. Election outcomes have the potential to inject uncertainty into the stock market. Regime change or shifts in the balance of power often lead to changes to government policies including tax reforms, trade agreements or foreign policy strategies. Managing Risks The Company’s risk assessment and the way in which significant risks are managed is an area of focus for the Board. Work here is driven by the Board’s assessment of the risks arising in the Company’s operations and identification and oversight of the controls exercised by the Board and its delegates, the Investment Manager and other service providers. These are recorded in the Company’s business risk matrix, which continues to serve as an effective tool to highlight and monitor the principal risks. The directors consider the principal risks of the Company to be those risks, or a combination thereof, that may materially threaten the Company’s ability to meet its investment objectives, its solvency, liquidity or viability. In assessing the principal risks, the directors considered the Company’s exposure to and likelihood of factors that they believe would result in significant erosion of value such as the impacts of climate change, a global recession, wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, higher borrowing costs, rebounding inflation, tightening credit conditions, fluctuating commodity prices and sharp moves in foreign exchange rates. At the time of this report, inflation, higher interest rates and fluctuating foreign exchange rates are impacting the Company and its investments. While the long-term severity and impact on the Company’s principal risks cannot currently be predicted with any accuracy, it is expected that an extended period of restrictive monetary policy would have detrimental lagged effects. Outlook With the Bank of Canada officially entering a cycle of policy easing on 5 June, 24 July, and 4 September, we are optimistic that the relative performance of Canadian equities will improve in the second half of the year. Several of the Fund’s core sector exposures, including Real Estate, Utilities, Pipelines and Financials, are poised to benefit from lower interest rates. As of early September, markets are pricing an additional two interest rate cuts from the BoC before the end of 2024, which should serve as a powerful tailwind for margins in these sectors. More importantly, as long as we avoid a severe economic slowdown, we believe falling rates should boost investor sentiment in these areas and result in capital flows returning to dividend-paying equities in Canada. The country’s population has grown by more than 8 per cent. since before the pandemic, resulting in the highest population growth of any developed nation in the world. This should continue to support robust consumer spending and opportunities for growth in domestic end-markets. Canada is also a global leader in responsible energy production, led by several world-renowned energy producers and infrastructure companies. The Investment Manager believes that oil, gas, and other commodities produced in Canada will have firm price support over the coming years – especially if geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East do not de-escalate soon. Canadian companies in the Energy and Materials sectors have accrued decades of technical expertise and operate their businesses under global best-practices, offering unique, high-quality exposure to resources. Despite having similar expected earnings growth over the next two years, Canadian equities are trading at an unprecedented valuation discount to U.S. stocks. With a dividend yield of more than 5 per cent, the Fund also provides a stable and growing stream of income to investors in the form of quarterly distributions. We believe the current valuation discount embedded in Canadian equities offers a compelling entry point into high-quality Canadian companies. We continue to advocate that U.K. investors seeking North American equity exposure should allocate capital to Canada. The Board joins me in thanking you for your continued support. Michael Phair Chairman 19 September 2024 Middlefield Group is a private and independent asset manager focused on equity income investment strategies. Located in Toronto, Canada, the company oversees a suite of funds, many of which have been recognised for excellence in various investment categories. Middlefield specialises in managing diversified equity income strategies for UK and Canadian investors with a particular focus on delivering stable distributions and capital appreciation over the long term. Investment Manager’s Interim Report The continued momentum in stocks linked to A.I. led to robust market returns during the first half of 2024 (H1). In the U.S., market leadership was extremely narrow, with Index heavyweights Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta contributing 62 per cent of the S&P’s 16.4 per cent total return (British Pounds). The TSX Composite Index lagged the S&P 500 in H1 due to its lower exposure to technology stocks and greater weighting to cyclical and value sectors. Even so, Canadian equities generated a respectable total return of 3.4 per cent in British Pounds and an above-average return of 6.1 per cent in Canadian dollars. The rally in technology stocks has lifted the forward price-to-earnings multiple on the S&P 500 to 23x – an 8-point premium to the TSX Composite. This represents the largest valuation gap between the two country’s indices in 25 years and, in our opinion, an extremely attractive entry point in Canadian equities. This comes at a time where future earnings growth between the two benchmarks is comparable. The TSX is expected to generate earnings growth of 13.8 per cent in 2025 and another 7.4 per cent in 2026 which compares to 13.5 per cent and 8.2 per cent for the S&P 500. Put simply, Canadian equities currently offer similar earnings growth versus U.S. stocks while trading at an unprecedented valuation discount. Although the earnings growth rate for the TSX High Dividend Index is expected to be lower than for the TSX Composite at 8.2% and 4.7% respectively the valuation gap to the S&P 500 is even greater with a 9-point gap in the forward price-to-earnings multiple. We expect lower interest rates to be a catalyst in narrowing the valuation discount in Canadian equities. The Bank of Canada (BoC) officially initiated its first easing cycle in four years with a cut to the overnight policy rate on 5 June, followed by further cuts on 24 July and 4 September. Markets are currently pricing an additional 2 cuts from the BoC over the next six months. Historically, the TSX has averaged double-digit gains twelve months after the first BoC rate cut. We believe core defensive yield sectors including utilities, telecommunications and real estate are particularly well-positioned to outperform against a falling rate backdrop. A common theme that emerged in economic data throughout H1 was normalisation. Growth expectations, inflation, and employment statistics have all been easing from abnormally high levels in recent months. We view this trend positively as long as the pace of easing remains gradual, as we expect. Although the Canadian dollar depreciated against the British Pound in H1, we anticipate this pressure to ease in the coming months. We are not forecasting a recession in the U.S. or Canada over the next twelve months and believe the evolving macro landscape is conducive to continued strong performance from North American equity markets. Canada’s population has increased 8 per cent since before the pandemic. While there are many Canadian companies that will benefit from such a rapid increase in domestic demand, we believe Real Estate is among the biggest beneficiaries. Supply of real estate has not kept pace with the surge in demand, causing Canada’s per capita housing stock and shopping centre space to fall by 2 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over this period. As a result, rents have increased while vacancy rates have fallen to historic lows within these asset classes. Apartment rents have risen close to 10 per cent year-over-year while retail property leasing spreads are currently exceeding 10 per cent. The operating environment is as attractive as it has ever been for these real estate sectors and, when investor focus finally shifts away from the headwind of rising interest rates, we expect a swift re-rating in REIT unit prices. Real Estate remains the Fund’s largest active sector weight relative to the Benchmark. The Fund’s core real estate exposure areas include necessity-based retail, apartments, industrial, and seniors housing. We maintain a positive outlook on Canadian energy stocks. As at 30 June 2024, the Fund had 17.6 per cent of its portfolio allocated to Canadian energy producers, 2.7 per cent above the Benchmark weighting. Energy producers should benefit from stable commodity prices in H2, supported by attractive supply/demand fundamentals and geopolitical tailwinds. They are also poised to get a boost to pricing from additions to export capacity. LNG Canada, the largest private infrastructure project in Canada’s history, will become operational in 2025. With an export capacity of 1.8 Bcf/d, Canadian gas producers will benefit from a material boost to production egress and be able to access global markets. Oil producers are also getting a lift from the recently completed Trans Mountain Pipeline project (TMX), which added 590,000 barrels of crude oil capacity per day. The Canada Energy Regulator estimates that the added capacity will add approximately $9 per barrel to what Canadian producers currently receive. Both projects will stimulate robust production and cash flow growth for Canadian energy companies which should lead to increased share buybacks, dividends and special distributions to shareholders. Canadian Natural Resources is our preferred oil-weighted producer and Tourmaline is our favourite company for natural gas exposure. We hold an equally positive view on Canadian energy infrastructure companies (i.e., pipelines) and are overweight the Benchmark by 1.4p ercentage points. Both LNG Canada and the TMX pipeline are expected to stimulate multi-billion-dollar investments from energy producers and will require a significant build-out of energy infrastructure to connect increasing production to this new infrastructure. Looking beyond Western Canada, natural gas will serve a key role in powering new data centres and fuel the surging electricity demand from corporations. Pipeline companies will play a critical role in gathering, processing and transporting natural gas volumes throughout North America to LNG export terminals. Enbridge, TC Energy and Pembina Pipeline are three core holdings that have exposure to both Canadian and US energy basins and are well-positioned for the upcoming capital expenditure cycle. Financials represented 25.0 per cent of the portfolio at the end of H1 – the largest sector weight in the portfolio. With rebounding capital markets activity and increased focus on cost-cutting, the sector returned 5.3 per cent in H1. Canada-centric banks have outperformed those with significant U.S. exposure recently, mainly due to idiosyncratic reasons, and we have re-positioned our exposure to banks accordingly. The regulatory environment in Canada is also supportive of the banks’ capital ratios, with OSFI maintaining the Domestic Stability Buffer. The Fund has been diversifying its exposure to financials by adding insurance companies and asset managers to the portfolio. These positions will expose the Fund to more profitable segments and geographies as broad-based equity markets reach all-time highs. As fund flows continue to improve, we maintain a positive outlook for Canadian asset managers in the second half of the year. The Fund had 11.1 per cent of the portfolio allocated to the utilities sector at the end of H1, below the Benchmark weight of 13.9 per cent. This underweight positioning was additive to performance in H1, with utilities having the second highest attribution during the period behind communication services, which was also underweight. After facing a series of challenges in 2023, including cost overruns and project delays, the utilities sector continued to lag the TSX index with a total return of -1.1 per cent in H1. Despite these past challenges, the surging demand for electricity to power new data centres is a trend that has caused us to take a more positive stance on the sector. We remain bullish on the sector’s long-term growth prospects and expect upcoming rate cuts to help improve sentiment for this sector. Our preferred picks include Capital Power, AltaGas and Emera. Top Holdings Top Holdings as at 30 June, 2024 Outlook We believe cyclical and value sectors are poised to outperform in H2. The A.I. theme has lifted valuations in technology and communication services sectors, presenting little opportunity for further multiple expansion. This has resulted in the largest valuation discount between the TSX Composite and S&P500 in over 25 years. We believe the Fund’s core exposures within real estate, financials, and energy should benefit once capital flows out of high-multiple growth sectors and money market funds into more reasonably priced areas of the market. As a result, we feel Canadian companies currently offer better risk-adjusted returns at a cheaper valuation compared to their US peers. The Bank of Canada has shifted towards an easing monetary policy, and we expect sentiment to improve for rate sensitive sectors. Despite being out of favour, fundamentals in these areas are attractive and support sustainable earnings growth. Canadian REITs continue to benefit from a structural demand/ supply imbalance which will drive consistent rent growth for many years to come. The build- out of the A.I. industry will require significant additional energy capacity to power data centres and provide growth opportunities within the utilities and pipeline sectors. We believe there is significant upside in many of these companies once investors are less focused on rates and more on company fundamentals. Canadian corporations have returned record amounts of capital to shareholders recently in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which is a trend we expect to continue. The Fund is focused on high-quality companies with visibility into free cash flow and dividend growth. MCT’s portfolio emphasises high dividend paying stocks which have a long track record of consistently increasing dividends. Over the past five years dividends received by the Fund’s portfolio have increased by 7.8% per annum, exceeding the 7.2% per annum growth rate for the Benchmark. Middlefield Limited ESG Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Policy and Stewardship Principles: ESG Policy As Investment Manager, Middlefield Limited (“Middlefield”) has a duty to maximise investment returns for the shareholders of the Fund, without undue risk of loss. Middlefield does this within the investment limits of the Fund’s investment mandate. Although the Fund is not an ESG-focused or sustainable fund, Middlefield incorporates ESG considerations into its investment process to aid decision making, identify potential risks and opportunities and to enhance long-term, risk-adjusted returns. Stephen Erlichman, one of the foremost experts on governance in Canada, serves as Chair, ESG for Middlefield to augment its ESG capabilities and processes. It is Middlefield’s responsibility to employ a disciplined investment process that seeks to identify attractive investment opportunities and evaluate material risks that could impact portfolio returns. Middlefield believes that ESG factors have become an important component of a thorough investment analysis and that the integration of ESG factors will result in a more comprehensive understanding of a company’s strategy, culture, and sustainability. Consistent with these objectives, Middlefield integrates ESG considerations into its investment process and these considerations are significant factors in selecting portfolio companies for its ESG-focused mandates. Our current ESG integration process includes the following: Many countries have established or are in the process of establishing standardised ESG disclosure requirements for corporate issuers. When enacted, these are expected to enhance the efficiency of the ongoing review and monitoring of a company’s ESG practices. Middlefield’s approach to ESG integration may evolve over time as more ESG and sustainability research and data become available. In addition to Middlefield’s integration of ESG considerations into its investment process, Middlefield has adopted Stewardship Principles and activities as set out below which are complementary to its ESG integration process. Middlefield’s Stewardship Principles Middlefield, as a Canadian asset manager, understands it has the responsibility to be an effective steward of the assets it manages for its clients in order to enhance the value of those assets for the benefit of its clients. The Canadian Coalition for Good Governance (“CCGG”) has published a set of seven stewardship principles, which have become recognised as Canada’s stewardship code for institutional asset owners and asset managers. Middlefield believes that CCGG’s stewardship principles should be tailored for asset managers depending on various factors, such as the size of the asset manager and the type of assets managed. Set out below are CCGG’s seven stewardship principles and a description of how Middlefield, as an independent Canadian asset manager whose predominant assets are public and private investment funds that invest in Canadian and international equities, carries out or intends to carry out such principles. Principle 1. Develop an approach to stewardship: Institutional investors should develop, implement, and disclose their approach to stewardship and how they meet their stewardship responsibilities. Middlefield integrates stewardship into its investment process. Such integration includes: Principle 2. Monitor companies: Institutional Investors should monitor the companies in which they invest. Middlefield monitors the companies in which it invests, including as follows: Principle 3. Report on voting activities: Institutional investors should adopt and publicly disclose their proxy voting guidelines and how they exercise voting rights. Middlefield exercises voting rights attached to the securities held by the funds it manages as follows: A. proxies will be voted in a manner that seeks to enhance the long-term sustainable value of the funds it manages; and B. proxies will be voted in a manner consistent with leading Canadian and international corporate governance practices. In addition, the public funds managed by Middlefield follow the proxy voting requirements of Part 10 of National Instrument 81-106 in regard to establishing policies and procedures for proxy voting and in regard to preparing and disclosing their proxy voting records. Principle 4. Engage with companies: Institutional investors should engage with portfolio companies. Middlefield engages with portfolio companies as follows: Principle 5. Collaborate with other institutional investors: Institutional investors should collaborate with other institutional investors where appropriate. Middlefield collaborates with other institutional investors through investor associations to which Middlefield belongs such as the Responsible Investment Association (RIA). Principle 6. Work with policy makers: Institutional investors should engage with regulators and other policy makers where appropriate. Middlefield’s professional advisors, such as the law firms and accounting firms it retains, assist to keep it up to date on developments that are material to it as an asset manager. It utilises its professional advisors, and it also relies on the organisations to which it belongs, to engage on its behalf with regulators and policy makers where appropriate. Principle 7. Focus on long-term sustainable value: Institutional investors should focus on promoting the creation of long-term sustainable value. Middlefield focuses on a portfolio company’s long-term success and sustainable value creation, including as follows: ESG Case Studies Manulife (Top 25% ESG ranking and 4.0% of the portfolio as at 30 June 2024) Summary: Manulife Financial is a leading insurance provider in Canada’s financial sector. Offering a comprehensive range of financial solutions, the company operates through a widespread network and digital platforms.

New standards and interpretations not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company There are no other standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Company. b. Going concern In the opinion of the directors, there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Fund have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the interim ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The directors have arrived at this opinion by considering, inter alia, the following factors: 3. Securities (at fair value through profit and loss) Please refer to Note 18 for the Schedule of Investments. 4. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Fund and bank balances with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying value of these assets approximates their fair value. 5. Other payables and accruals 6. Stated capitalThe authorised share capital of the Fund is split into two management shares of no par value and an unlimited number of redeemable participating preference shares of no par value, the latter of which are attributable solely to the Fund. The holders of redeemable participating preference shares are entitled to receive in proportion to their holdings, all of the revenue proﬁts of the Fund (including accumulated revenue reserves). Each redeemable participating preference shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share held, provided all amounts payable in respect of that share have been paid. Management shares are non-redeemable, have no right in respect of the accrued entitlement, and have no right to participate in the assets of the Fund on a winding-up. In all other respects, the management shares have the same rights and restrictions as redeemable participating preference shares. Each management share entitles the holder to one vote for each share held. Redeemable participating preference shares are redeemed at the absolute discretion of the directors. Since redemption is at the discretion of the directors, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 32, the redeemable participating preference shares are classiﬁed as equity. The Fund will not give effect to redemption requests in respect of more than 25 per cent. of the shares then in issue, or such lesser percentage as the directors may decide. At the period end, there were 18,195,000 (30 June 2023: 18,195,000, 31 December 2023: 18,195,000) treasury shares in issue. Treasury shares have no value and no voting rights. FCA regulation of ‘non-mainstream pooled investments’ On 1 January 2014, the FCA introduced rules relating to the restrictions on the retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes and close substitutes (non-mainstream pooled investments). UK investment trusts are excluded from these restrictions, as are other “excluded securities” as deﬁned by the FCA. As reported in last year’s annual report, the Board believes that the Company’s shares are “excluded securities” under the FCA’s deﬁnitions of such and, as a result, the FCA’s restrictions on retail distribution do not apply. This status is reviewed annually and the Board intends to conduct the Company’s affairs to retain such status for the foreseeable future. Retained Earnings This reserve records all net gains and losses and transactions with owners not recorded elsewhere. This reserve is available for distribution to the shareholders. Dividends paid to shareholders are recognised directly in this reserve. 7. Net asset value per redeemable participating preference shareThe net asset value per share of 121.22p (30 June 2023: 121.63p, 31 December 2023: 121.55p) is based on the net assets at the period end of £129,081,580 (30 June 2023: £129,522,522, 31 December 2023: £129,439,090) and on 106,487,250 redeemable participating preference shares, being the number of redeemable participating preference shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury) at the period end (30 June 2023: 106,487,250 shares, 31 December 2023: 106,487,250 shares). 8. Dividend and interest income 9. Net movement in the fair value of securities 10. Profit/(loss) per redeemable participating preference share – basic and dilutedBasic proﬁt/(loss) per redeemable participating preference share is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt attributable to redeemable participating preference shares of £2,464,402 (30 June 2023: £4,344,825 loss, 31 December 2023: £1,659,589 loss) by the weighted average number of redeemable participating preference shares outstanding during the period of 106,487,250 shares (30 June 2023: 106,487,250, 31 December 2023: 106,487,250 shares). The allocation between revenue and capital can be found on the Statement of Comprehensive Income of the Fund on page 27. 11. DividendsDividends of 1.325 pence per share were paid on a quarterly basis during the year in the months of January and April £2,821,912 (30 June 2023: £2,768,669, 31 December 2023: £5,537,337) for the year. On 31 July 2024 a dividend of £1,410,956 was paid at 1.325 pence per share. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, as this was approved on4 July 2024, being after the reporting date, no accrual was reﬂected in the 2024 Interim Financial Statements for this amount of £1,410,956 (6 July 2023: £1,384,334). 12. TaxationThe Fund is subject to UK corporation tax at a rate of 19% (2023: 19%). The Company adopted UK tax residency on11 October 2011. Since that date the Company has been managed in such a way as to be able to meet the conditions for approval as an investment trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. As an investment trust, all capital gains are exempt from UK corporation tax. On 7 December 2012, the Company received approval from HM Revenue & Customs to be treated as an investment trust in accordance with Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and will seek to remain so approved. 13.

The fees for the above are all arm’s length transactions. 14. Loan payableThe Fund has a Credit Facility Agreement with RBC whereby RBC provides the Credit Facility, with a maximum principal amount of the lesser of CAD 75,000,000 and 25 per cent. of the total asset value of the Fund. The credit facility was amended on 3 April, 2024 to replace Banker’s Acceptances with CORRA (Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average). At 30 June 2024, the amount drawn down under the Credit Facility was CAD 46,500,000 (GBP equivalent at amortised cost of £26,882,228) (period ended 30 June 2023: CAD 48,000,000 (GBP equivalent at amortised cost of £28,286,013), 31 December 2023: CAD 37,000,000 (GBP equivalent at amortised cost of £21,831,966)). The loan value of CAD 46,500,000 was made up of four Term CORRA loans as follows: As at 30 June 2024, the interest paid on the Banker’s Acceptance and Term CORRA loans totalled £768,265 (period ended 30 June 2023: £749,445, 31 December 2023: £1,388,175) with £76,953 accrued at period end. As at 30 June 2023, pre-paid interest and stamping fees of £122,328 (year ended 31 December 2023: £43,075) were paid on the Banker’s Acceptance. Prime Loans, the Prime Rate minus 0.35 per cent. In the case of Term CORRA loan, a stamping fee of 0.60 per cent. per annum is payable. 15. Security agreementIn connection with entry into the Credit Facility Agreement, the Fund has entered into a general security agreement with RBC, pursuant to which the Fund has granted RBC interests in respect of collateral, being all present and future personal property, including the securities portfolio, as security for the Fund’s obligations under the Credit Facility Agreement. 16. Financial instrumentsFair values The carrying amounts of the investments, accrued income, other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loan payable and other payables approximate their fair values. In 2015, the percentage of the value of portfolio assets which may be invested in securities listed on a recognised stock exchange outside Canada was increased to up to 40 per cent. Management of capital The Investment Manager manages the capital of the Fund in accordance with the Fund’s Investment Objectives and Policy. The capital structure of the Fund consists of proceeds from the issue of preference shares, loans and reserve accounts. The Investment Manager manages and adjusts its capital in response to general economic conditions, the risk characteristics of the underlying assets and working capital requirements. Generally speaking, the Fund will reduce leverage when investments are likely to decrease in value and will increase leverage when investment appreciation is anticipated. In order to maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Fund may borrow or repay debt under its Credit Facility or undertake other activities deemed appropriate under the speciﬁc circumstances. The Fund and the Company do not have any externally imposed capital requirements. However, the Fund is subject to bank covenants in respect of leverage and complied with those covenants for the whole of both 2024 and 2023. Investment and trading activities It is intended that the Fund will continue throughout its life to be primarily invested in Canadian and U.S. equities portfolio. The Fund’s investing activities expose it to various types of risk that are associated with the ﬁnancial instruments and markets in which it invests. The most important types of ﬁnancial risk to which the Fund is exposed are market price risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty may be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Fund. The Fund’s principal ﬁnancial assets are bank balances and cash, other receivables and investments as set out in the Statement of Financial Position which represents the Fund’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the ﬁnancial assets. The credit risk on bank balances is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings of A, AA- and A+ assigned by Standard and Poor’s rating agency. All transactions in listed securities are settled upon delivery using approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal as delivery of securities sold is only made once the broker has received payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been received by the broker. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligations. Where the Investment Manager makes an investment in debt or corporate securities, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account to manage the Company’s exposure to risk of default. Investments in debt or corporate securities are across a variety of sectors and geographical markets, to avoid concentration of credit risk. The Fund’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of the assets on the Statement of Financial Position. Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors speciﬁc to the individual ﬁnancial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar ﬁnancial instruments traded in the market. The Fund’s exposure to market price risk is comprised mainly of movements in the value of the Fund’s investments. It is the business of the Investment Manager to manage the portfolio and borrowings to achieve the best returns. The directors manage the risk inherent in the portfolio by monitoring, on a formal basis, the Investment Manager’s compliance with the Company’s stated Investment Policy and reviewing investment performance. Country risk On 17 January 2012, the FRC released “Responding to the increased country and currency risk in ﬁnancial reports”. This update from the FRC included guidance on responding to the increased country and currency risk as a result of funding pressures on certain European countries, the curtailment of capital spending programmes (austerity measures) and regime changes in the Middle East. The Fund invests primarily in Canadian and U.S. securities. The Investment Manager monitors the Company’s exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis. The Board has reviewed the disclosures and believes that no additional disclosures are required because the Canadian and U.S. economies are stable. Fair value measurements IFRS 13 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13 are as follows: The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the signiﬁcance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require signiﬁcant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a level 3 measurement. Assessing the signiﬁcance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors speciﬁc to the asset or liability. The determination of what constitutes ‘observable’ requires signiﬁcant judgment by the directors. The directors consider observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and veriﬁable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The following tables present the Fund’s ﬁnancial instruments by level within the valuation hierarchy as of 30 June 2024, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023: The Fund holds securities that are traded in active markets. Such ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as Level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 in the year. Price sensitivity At 30 June 2024, if the market prices of the securities had been 30% higher with all other variables held constant, the increase in net assets attributable to holders of redeemable participating preference shares for the year would have been £45,701,609 (30 June 2023: £46,709,619, 31 December 2023: £43,993,051) higher, arising due to the increase in the fair value of ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. At 30 June 2024, if the market prices of the securities had been 30% lower with all other variables held constant, the decrease in net assets attributable to holders of redeemable shares for the year would have been equal, but opposite, to the ﬁgures stated above. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Fund’s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, debt securities and loan payable. The cash and cash equivalents are subject to ﬂoating rates and are considered to be part of the investment strategy of the Fund. No other hedging is undertaken in respect of this interest rate risk. There were no ﬁxed rate assets or liabilities at 30 June 2024, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023. The following table details the Fund’s exposure to interest rate risk at 30 June 2024, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023: * Interest on bank balances is not material to the ﬁnancial statements and are based on prevailing bank base rates. The above analysis excludes short-term debtors and creditors as all material amounts are non-interest bearing. Interest rate sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2024, had interest rates been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Company’s net assets attributable to redeemable participating preference shares for the year would have decreased by £117,526 (30 June 2023: £131,622, 31 December 2023: £86,994) due to an increase in interest payable on the loan and to a lesser extent an increase in interest earnings on cash and cash equivalents. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund cannot meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Fund’s primary source of liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, securities at fair value through proﬁt or loss and the Credit Facility. The Fund’s investments are considered to be readily realisable, predominantly issued by Canadian and U.S. companies and REITs listed on a Canadian Stock Exchange, and actively traded. As at 30 June 2024, the Fund’s ability to manage liquidity risk was as follows: As at 30 June 2023, the Fund’s ability to manage liquidity risk was as follows: As at 31 December 2023, the Fund’s ability to manage liquidity risk was as follows: Currency risk The Fund is denominated in GBP, whereas the Fund’s principal investments are denominated in CAD and USD. Consequently, the Fund is exposed to currency risk. The Fund’s policy is therefore to actively monitor exposure to currency risk. The Board reserves the right to employ currency hedging but, other than in exceptional circumstances, does not intend to hedge. The Board considers that exposure was signiﬁcant at the year end. The Fund’s net exposure to CAD currency at the year end was as follows: The Fund’s net exposure to USD currency at the year end was as follows: Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2024, had GBP strengthened against the CAD by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the decrease in net assets attributable to shareholders would amount to approximately £6,297,937 (30 June 2023: £6,477,374, 31 December 2023: £6,478,328). Had GBP weakened against the CAD by 5%, this would amount to an increase in net assets attributable to shareholders of approximately £6,297,937 (30 June 2023: £6,477,374, 31 December 2023: £6,478,328). At 30 June 2024, had GBP strengthened against the USD by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the decrease in net assets attributable to shareholders would amount to approximately £148,549 (30 June 2023: £8,921, 31 December 2023: £4,135). Had GBP weakened against the USD by 5%, this would amount to an increase in net assets attributable to shareholders of approximately £148,549 (30 June 2023: £8,921, 31 December 2023: £4,135). 17.

Title: Moore: Biden & Harris tech policy puts America last

The Wall Street Journal noted last week that American shareholders will lose tens of billions of dollars in investment income from their stock holdings in Silicon Valley companies like Google and Apple if several European Union sham lawsuits prevail.The EU’s courts outrageously ruled this week that Apple shareholders owe Europe 13.5 billion euros in back taxes because the company took advantage of Ireland’s low 12.5% tax rate. The EU “competition chief” declared that this sham court decision “is a big win for European citizens and tax justice.” No, it’s a big win for big government.Google shareholders are now forced to pay the EU $2.7 billion because its search engine has become dominant in the European market. The European search engines are so inferior that nobody wants to use them. So, sue American companies.Let’s be clear here: The EU laggards are simply green with envy. The Eurozone has been crushed by American tech dominance. No company in socialist Europe has found a way to compete with American innovation at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and so on. Since they can’t compete, they invent sore-loser lawsuits.The bigger issue is why the Biden administration isn’t defending American companies from European extortion. These tech lawsuits are a tax on American knowhow and innovation. Instead of defending American shareholders from the EU predators, the Biden regulators give legitimacy to the foreign courts. How can the U.S. government complain against specious antitrust attacks against Google and Apple when our own regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are bringing copycat lawsuits against our tech giants in U.S. courts?The capricious fine against Google is a result of an American company shopping around the globe to find the lowest tax climate (Ireland) for doing business. This is illegal? Our corporate tax rate thanks to the Trump tax cut is now 21%, down from 35% under former President Barack Obama. But President Joe Biden and now presidential candidate Kamala Harris want to raise it back up to 28% or more. That only encourages more jobs and investment to move offshore. Did I mention that Ireland’s rate is just 12.5%?Instead of lowering the rates here, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to force Ireland and other low-tax countries to raise their rates to a global minimum tax of 15% or more.Similarly, antitrust lawsuits from Europe and Washington aimed at American tech companies are spurious because nearly every price for tech services — from cellphones to drone deliveries to internet searches to fiber optic hookups — has been falling. How are consumers getting gouged if they keep paying less? I often don’t like the politics of Big Tech. But the end result of what Washington is doing to penalize American tech giants for building a better mousetrap is to move the high-tech hubs of the world — from Silicon Valley to Austin to Boston to Miami — to competitor nations. That’s a good way to lose jobs and put America last.Stephen Moore is a cofounder of Unleash Prosperity. He is also an economic advisor to the Trump campaign.

Abhishek Banerjee, smallcase Manager and Founder at Lotusdew: “Nifty has dislodged China as the largest country in MSCI EM and is hitting all-time highs with 2 active wars. This shows that India is becoming a safe haven instead of an emerging country where money is flowing in to keep it safe and out of conflict. While India’s account deficit is also hitting all time high, we are sitting on highest forex reserves too. The ability to cut rates to weather any shocks, corporate private capex on the anvil and record inflows from SIP - India looks to be a great place to be invested in” Top gainers on the NSE as at 3 pm: M&M (4.92%), Coal India (3.37%), JSW Steel (3.36%), L&T (3.05%), Adani Enterprises (2.38%) Top losers: Grasim (-1.77%), SBI(-1.27%), TCS (-0.78%), IndusInd (-0.72%), Bajaj Finance (-0.55%) Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on September 20, 2024, were 2,381 against 1,543 stocks that declined, and 107 remained unchanged.

TBO Tek stock trades flat on the NSE at ₹1,741.30. Why the stock market is rising today, here is the view from Palka Arora Chopra, Director, Master Capital Services Ltd: The current upswing in the stock market results from market forecasts of increased foreign inflows into India following the Fed rate decrease, combined with the fact that US Jobless Claims are at their lowest point since May 2024 alleviating concerns about the US market’s slowdown. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Averages and S&P 500 index surged to 1.7%. Asia saw a rise in markets in Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. Domestic stocks followed the global rally’s path. The US labor market is not failing; rather, it is simply slowing down, according to the good labour market data released recently. Since inflation is under control, a scenario with declining interest rates calls for a soft landing for the US. This is good news for the world’s equity markets. Yes Bank has received an Order from the Income-tax Department, at 2:19 PM on September 19, 2024, imposing penalty amounting to Rs. 10,000/- for delayed submission of information called for u/s 143(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the Act”) for Assessment Year 2018-19 Shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹22.99 1. ⁠Cosmic CRF: ORDER Subsidiary of Company has bagged order worth INR 127 Cr for supply of Cold Formed Steel Sheet Piles within 1 Year. 2.

Sensex and Nifty 50 jumped 1% to hit all-time highs. What is driving the Indian stock market, here is the view from Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd: The Indian markets are rallying today, driven by strong global cues. Historically, emerging markets tend to outperform during the onset of a rate-cut cycle in the U.S., especially when coupled with a decline in the dollar index and U.S. bond yields. Indian markets, backed by robust fundamentals, remain resilient despite concerns over valuations. Large-cap stocks, particularly in the private banking sector, continue to look attractive, fueling the current bullish momentum. However, there is noticeable underperformance in the broader market. This positive trend is expected to persist unless significant negative developments arise on the domestic or global front. For Nifty, 25,921 is the immediate target, while 25,500 should serve as a strong support level.

Gold prices steadied near record highs on Friday and were poised for a weekly gain, as markets adjusted to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent super-sized interest rate reduction and signs that further cuts were on the horizon. Spot gold held its ground at $2,586.98 per ounce, and has climbed about 0.4% for the week so far. - Reuters Indian capital and equity markets were largely unaffected on Thursday following a half-point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in over four years. Equities, gold and bond prices rose only marginally as investors had already priced in the rate cut. This is in contrast to the global financial markets which saw stocks and gold hitting new highs.

Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock that we have today is CCL Products. It has bounced off a support this week and looks to rally further. Supporting this, the broader trend is positive, and the price action is bullish. Here are the intraday supports and resistances for widely traded stocks such as Reliance Industries, ITC, ONGC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, TCS, and SBI The stock of CCL Products (India) saw a price decline over the past couple of weeks. After touching a record high of ₹854 in early September, the scrip started to drop. However, the overall uptrend remains valid, and the stock has appreciated so far this week. The chart shows that it has rebounded from support and that further gains are likely from here. We anticipate the stock to rise to ₹830 in the short term.
