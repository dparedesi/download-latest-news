Last week, the world watched as $1 trillion was wiped off the stock market in a single day, a huge bonfire kindled by the little-known Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek. Its release of a new AI model, known as R1, upended assumptions about US supremacy in AI and raised the prospect that some in China are learning how to beat Silicon Valley at its own game. The model can “reason” to solve complex scientific problems and performs at par with leading-edge software from US tech giants, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models. It quickly dislodged OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US IOS App store. Alongside the geopolitical challenge, DeepSeek’s breakthrough has dual implications for the tech industry. Firstly, it is likely to accelerate the commercial development and uptake of AI, much as ChatGPT did in 2022. At the same time, it threatens to demolish investment assumptions that have underpinned the entire US stock market, by seeming to show that developing advanced AI models does not require vast amounts of infrastructure and thus capital. The question being asked with sudden urgency from California to Wall Street: Has China caught up in AI at just the moment that many working in the field claim they are on the brink of a historic breakthrough that will put machines on a par with human-level intelligence – a threshold known as artificial general intelligence? “[DeepSeek’s] algorithmic innovations remind us that China and the US are neck and neck and that our technological edge isn’t guaranteed, pushing our industry to make AI more efficient,” says Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and chair of Google. “To get to AGI first, we’ll need to continue to invest in talent, support our vibrant open-source ecosystem, and ensure we out-innovate, not just outspend, our competitors.” DeepSeek was founded on Silicon Valley-style levels of ambition. It started out in 2023 as a side project for the eccentric hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng, just as the race to replicate ChatGPT was heating up. It has since turned into one of China’s leading AI labs. “Why is Silicon Valley so innovative? Because they dare to do things,” Liang said in an interview last year. “When ChatGPT came out, the tech community in China lacked confidence in frontier innovation.” He added: “From investors to [Chinese] big tech, they all thought that the gap was too big and opted to focus on applications instead. But innovation starts with confidence.” As state-owned funds in China have taken on a larger role funding start-ups in the past few years, the entrepreneurial ecosystem has felt pressured to guarantee returns for fear of losing the country’s assets. DeepSeek is distinctive among Chinese generative AI start-ups in that it has not raised any external financing and has therefore been free from these constraints. A pure research lab, echoing the early days of DeepMind in the UK and OpenAI in the US, DeepSeek has focused all its effort on pushing the field of AI forward, rather than trying to make money. And even though it prides itself on being entirely founded on home-grown talent, it has adopted a culture often found in the US tech heartland. “It’s unique among Chinese AI companies,” says an AI investor in China. “There is no politics or management friction like at the other big tech companies or larger start-ups. People don’t have specific titles or reporting lines.” DeepSeek’s origins as a quantitative hedge fund meant it had engineering talent with a deep understanding of chips. Its breakthrough turned on its apparent success at training advanced AI models without spending the hundreds of millions of dollars its US rivals have. It claimed that the final training step for R1 cost only $5.6 million. The figure, however, doesn’t include many other costs involved in developing its models, including computing infrastructure and previous training runs, making it hard to draw precise comparisons. It may also have cut corners to save costs: OpenAI claims to have evidence that DeepSeek trained on the output from OpenAI’s own models – not something allowed under its terms of use, though an underhand practice thought to be widely used by US companies as well. Ironically, Washington’s attempt to hamper China’s AI sector by imposing export controls on high-end US chips from 2022 onwards may have contributed to DeepSeek’s breakthrough. Without access to leading-edge silicon, the company was forced to find innovative ways to squeeze higher performance out of the less sophisticated chips it was able to buy. The company’s claims about the low cost and advanced capabilities of its models have touched off a heated debate about how disruptive the company will turn out to be. Silicon Valley’s leaders have paid tribute to its innovations, while also playing down their significance. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model “impressive”, while Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, credited the company with making “advances that we will hope to implement in our systems”. Yet Zuckerberg also cast DeepSeek’s breakthrough as just one among many in a field that is moving at breakneck speed, making it hard to tell how deeply its low-cost approach would change the dynamics of the industry, he said. According to some China tech watchers, DeepSeek’s advances aren’t significant enough to change the fact that the country’s AI companies have been fast followers, largely devoted to emulating their US counterparts rather than setting the direction themselves. “DeepSeek’s work falls into that category. What would really turn the tables in US-China competition is if they built something that actually pushed the frontier. We’ll see if they get there,” says Helen Toner, an AI policy analyst at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and a former board member at OpenAI. Yet others say that the fact that a Chinese tech start-up has been behind the latest head-turning advance represents a watershed moment, changing the dynamic in the AI race between the two countries. [ Irish schools struggling without guidance on safe AI use in the classroomOpens in new window ] “DeepSeek’s latest models may not mean that China is pulling ahead of the US in the AI race, but it does prove that Chinese companies are making remarkable strides in software innovation that mitigate the constraints imposed by US export controls,” wrote Tilly Zhang, a China tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused research firm, in a note published this week. “The race for AI leadership is no longer just about who has access to the best chips, but about who puts them to best use.” While the significance of DeepSeek’s technical breakthroughs is a matter of debate, there is no mistaking the shock wave that passed through the stock market as investors digested the implications of its main innovation: dramatically cutting the cost of training for the most advanced AI models. DeepSeek’s models appear to undermine the argument that US AI companies have made vociferously over the past year: that AI advances require vast amounts of capital and infrastructure to develop and deploy their technology at scale. Instead, they suggest that far more expensive, US-developed models would have little to differentiate them, raising fears among investors of a sharp deflationary shock. [ The Irish Times view on artificial intelligence: the fever dream breaksOpens in new window ] “There was a sense of American exceptionalism – that only America had this technology, and only Americans had the money to do this,” says Jim Tierney, a US growth stock investor at AllianceBernstein. “The commoditisation of these models is happening much faster than we thought.” Much of Silicon Valley fell back on the argument that others in the industry will quickly copy DeepSeek’s innovations, bringing down the cost of training AI models across the board. Executives like Microsoft’s Satya Nadella claimed it will make the technology more affordable for customers and boost its use – something that would benefit the entire industry. In a sign of the company’s confidence in its status, DeepSeek has published its research and released its models in “open-weights” form, a more limited version of open-source software that allows anyone to download, use and modify the technology. The move will attract a wide international following among software developers looking for “open” models to build applications on. Most models developed by Silicon Valley’s leading AI companies remain closed, though there are exceptions – notably Meta, whose open models have surged in popularity. But DeepSeek’s model is accessible at a far lower cost. The Chinese company says it charges only 1.4 cents for each 1 million tokens it generates – roughly equivalent to 700,000 words. By contrast, Meta charges $2.80 for the same output from its largest models. “A whole number of developers are experimenting with what’s now a Chinese open source AI-based solution,” says Keegan McBride, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute who focuses on the geopolitics of AI. “It really shows that in the AI space, the US isn’t the only option on the table.” While Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, described DeepSeek in glowing terms as proof that “open-source models are surpassing proprietary ones”, the start-up nonetheless poses a direct challenge to Meta. The company’s “claim to fame has been creating open-weight models that aren’t too far behind the bleeding edge, and DeepSeek just beat them at their own game,” says Toner. Beyond DeepSeek’s impact on the market for AI products, its breakthrough also promises to have geopolitical repercussions, coming at what many believe is a pivotal moment in the competition between the US and China for AI supremacy. If R1 and its successors become the global standard for “open” AI models, it would handicap the US, warned Meta’s Zuckerberg. “For our national advantage, it’s important that it’s an American standard,” he said. “We want to build the AI system that people around the world are using.” DeepSeek has “accelerated the urgency for people in every country to assess ... the technological balance of power emerging between various countries,” says Craig Mundie, a Microsoft veteran and former White House adviser, who counsels Altman on tech policy and strategy. If China has managed to get on to an equal footing with the US on AI, it has implications for everything that the technology could eventually be used for, warned Dario Amodei, chief executive of US AI start-up Anthropic. “It seems likely that China could direct more talent, capital and focus to military applications of the technology,” Amodei wrote of DeepSeek’s advances. “Combined with its large industrial base and military-strategic advantages, this could help China take a commanding lead on the global stage, not just for AI but for everything.” Mundie, who also chairs the US-China AI Dialogue diplomatic forum established by the late US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, pointed out that AI was the “ultimate dual-use technology”, meaning it has both positive and dangerous purposes. The emergence of DeepSeek is likely to hang over discussions when the diplomatic group convenes within the next 90 days to discuss a multilateral but common safety structure for AI software, which Mundie writes about in his latest book Genesis, co-authored with Kissinger and Schmidt. “It doesn’t mean everyone will have the same laws or rules, but [building] the architecture by which these machines grow up understanding human values and comport with societal choices everywhere in the world, I think is an urgent task,” Mundie says. Meanwhile, aspiring young entrepreneurs in China are looking towards DeepSeek and its founder as inspiration to build a new generation of powerful technology. A teenager who came to pay respects at Liang’s house in the village of Mililing this week says: “He is a pragmatic technologist. He put together a team that ... surpassed those of companies like OpenAI that we couldn’t compete with before. He is a great person who has made contributions to China.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: DEI: Google joins US firms abandoning diversity recruitment goals

The U-turn by a former diversity champion comes as big US firms face pressure to abandon the policies Google has become the latest big US firm to scrap its goals to recruit more workers from underrepresented groups, BBC News understands. The decision to abandon the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) recruitment targets comes after the company carried out an annual review of its corporate policies. The technology giant is also reviewing some of its other DEI programmes. US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House just over two weeks ago, Trump has ordered government agencies to eliminate such initiatives. "We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities," a Google spokesperson said. "We've updated our [annual investor report] language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic." The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Between 2021 and 2024, Google's investor reports stated its commitment to make "diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do". That line is not in its latest report, which was published on Wednesday. In recent years, Google had been an outspoken supporter of DEI targets, particularly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests that followed his death. At the time, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, set a five-year goal to increase the number of its leaders who came from underrepresented groups by 30%. According to the company, the proportion of black people among its leadership almost doubled between 2020 and last year. It also said representation of women and Latino people had increased in those roles. Google is the latest major company to make a U-turn on its diversity policies. Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have rolled back their DEI programmes. Apple has stood out by pushing back against this trend. Last month, the tech giant's board asked investors to vote against a proposal to end its diversity policies. The proposal by conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), called on the iPhone maker to abolish its DEI policies, saying they expose firms to "litigation, reputational and financial risks". Last week, the retail chain Target was sued by a group of shareholders, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who said the firm had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies. The lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop. Target has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets. In the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated, without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC. The remarks, which came less than 24 hours after the crash, were in line with the White House's efforts to undo such programmes.

Title: Ruchii restaurant review: This neighbourhood Indian spot has the potential to become a foodie destination

I love a thali – tiny copper pots gleaming like a miniature banquet, each promising its own little world of flavour. But before I even get to order it at Ruchii, crisp poppadoms land on the table, accompanied by a green apple chutney – light, tart and clean – and a strawberry chutney that tastes unmistakably of the fruit itself. Both are made in-house, arriving as I’m still surveying the menu. Ruchii sits just off George’s Avenue in Blackrock, having relocated from its former perch above Conway’s pub. It’s now in a bigger space with a wilfully expansive menu and just enough gloss to remind you that its owners, Murali and Sateesh Sayana, have a clear vision for elevating Indian cuisine. The menu roams the subcontinent like a train on the Indian Railways: butter chicken and rogan josh from the north, dosas from the south, and the fiery Chettinad spice blends from Tamil Nadu rattling through the lot. This kind of range and variety could spell trouble for the kitchen, but it turns out to be no issue for the team of four Indian chefs, led by chef-patron Sateesh. Growing up in his father’s restaurant in Andhra Pradesh, Sateesh learned to mix idli and dosa batter as a child. Following professional stints in Jaipur and Agra, he moved to Dublin in 2002 to cook in Rasam, and has laid on feasts for everyone from the Indian prime minister to Cher. The soft-shell crab (€13.50) is a tasty starter, lightly battered and fried to a golden crunch. It is accompanied with chutneys and curry leaf mayonnaise, firmly anchoring it in the south Indian coastal tradition. The cocktails, however, are a little less precise. A margarita (€10.95) is overly sweet, missing that all-important sour-salty snap that keeps you coming back for another sip. Drinkable, yes, but not the cocktail you’d want paired with food this vibrant. Stick to beer or wine. The well-considered list focuses on aromatic, full-bodied options with enough weight for the dishes, though I remain unconvinced that wine is the ideal match for Indian food. The fish curry (€22.50) features large, fresh chunks of cod cloaked in ginger, garlic, mustard seed and that floral hit of pathar ke phool, all luxuriating in a creamy coconut sauce. We’ve paired it with pilau rice (€3), fragrant with rosewater and topped with fried onions, alongside wonderful garlic naan – hot from the tandoor, steaming and lavishly slathered in ghee. [ Firebyrd takeaway review: Nashville fried chicken rules the roost at this D6 restaurantOpens in new window ] Then comes the thali (€33), the main event, a copper tray bristling with little pots arranged in perfect order. Inspired by the six primary tastes of Indian culinary tradition – salt, sour, sweet, bitter, astringent and pungent – it’s as much a lesson in balance as it is a meal. Salty richness is found in the dal Makhani. It is made from urad lentils and is less buttery than you may find elsewhere, but is slow-cooked to bring an earthy depth. The creamy tomato sauce in the butter chicken brings a delicate sweetness in a base so velvety you could wear it, while the tender lamb pieces in the rogan josh hum with the pungency of toasted fennel and the warmth of cardamom. The spinach, which is rich and creamy, is cooked with fenugreek to bring a subtle bitterness to the dish; and the prawns, in a coconut-based sauce, get a touch of sourness from tamarind and raw mango. It’s one of those sauces you find yourself finishing long after the prawns are gone, wishing there were more as it lingers on the palate, allowing the spicy heat to build. A brightly coloured beetroot raita is subtly sweet and refreshing. Dessert is a lentil doughnut drowning in jaggery syrup, unapologetically sweet and defiantly sticky. It’s exactly the type of ending you’d expect from an Indian meal – traditional and indulgent. Ruchii’s menu reflects India’s culinary diversity, with its extensive selection offering something for everyone. It’s a mix of the comforting and the challenging, the traditional and the experimental. For a suburban spot, it punches above its weight – a bold attempt to cram the breadth of Indian cuisine into a single menu. It’s also an invitation: to explore, to taste and to learn about the rich histories and traditions that shape each dish. With thoughtful execution, such a menu has the potential to elevate this neighbourhood spot into a genuine destination for Indian food enthusiasts. I, for one, will be back to explore more. Dinner for two with a cocktail and two beers was €99.95. The verdict An extensive menu of tasty Indian dishes. Food provenance Irish Country Meats, Gahan Meats, Keelings and Kish Fish. Vegetarian options Palak kofta, Kadai paneer, dal, baby aubergines in a curry sauce, and thali. Wheelchair access Fully accessible with an accessible toilet. Music Bollywood music in the background.

Title: What 2025 Has in Store For The Future of ESG

Once a corporate imperative, the ESG movement is now facing mounting backlash, forcing companies and investors to rethink their approach. What is the future of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)? The global craze of companies, countries, investors and regulators wanting to achieve sustainability goals based on environmental, social and governance benchmarks is now facing strong headwinds. Despite clear evidence that the world faces growing threats from climate change, rising social inequality and shaky governance, many of the actors that had been strong advocates for ESG are retreating from their stated aims. Consider these recent developments: First, The US has (once again) withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, leading other major countries such as Indonesia to doubt the credibility of the climate targets set in Paris. Then there is growing pushback from major companies in the EU around the EU ESG Taxonomy, saying it makes them globally uncompetitive and raises their cost of capital. More and more companies are scaling back or abandoning their ESG targets as they realise it is either too unrealistic, too expensive or politically unwise to stay the course. ESG funds, long the darling of investors, have underperformed in investment returns compared to non-ESG funds in recent years and also saw an outflow of funds; Blackrock, the “cheerleader“ for the ESG investing movement, has walked away from a number of its ESG ambitions. DEI programs in rich, mainly Western countries are coming under fire and many such initiatives are being phased out. So, is the ESG movement over? Not really. ESG will continue to evolve in new ways despite these headwinds. In fact, in some ways these current developments could help usher in a newer, better form of ESG: call it ESG 2.0. What would ESG 2.0 look like? Here are some likely scenarios: First, companies will continue to make investments in ESG but will measure tangible financial returns before they make these investments; these returns will include calculating the reduction in cost of funding (especially in developing countries), monetising decarbonisation efforts through carbon credits, achieving lasting operating cost reductions, and so on. Next, regulators will shift the emphasis away from “compliance” based ESG, ie submitting reports, to “enforcement“ based ESG where bad actors will face sanctions in the form of higher taxes, fines or loss of licenses. All investors, regardless of whether they have an explicit ESG focus, will integrate ESG considerations into their investment decisions but will do so by factoring in climate, social and other externalities that directly impact the value of their investment. Then you have new stakeholder alliances involving NGOs, the media, the legal profession, and ordinary citizens will harness the power of AI and the information revolution to mount more targeted campaigns against companies that are bad actors. In many ways, all these scenarios are already playing out. Climate lawsuits led by stakeholders against fossil fuel companies are happening with more frequency than ever in various courtrooms around the world. More and more governments are implementing carbon and other natural resource taxes. More and more “green transition“ funds are available to governments and companies for developing countries under the COP framework that are committed to meeting these goals. Investors are nervous about “climate-related bankruptcies” like Pacific Gas & Electric and are actively investing in tools to quantify such risks. Welcome to the new world of ESG, against a daunting backdrop of a burning world! Let’s hope it succeeds this time! Ravi Chidambaram is the founder & CEO of RIMM Sustainability, a Singapore-based global provider of ESG software solutions for enterprises. He has many years of experience as an entrepreneur, lecturer and thought leader in both the corporate finance and sustainability field as founder of TC Capital, Adjunct Professor at Yale NUS College and RIMM.

In a significant development for the Bitcoin (BTC) market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded Fund (ETF) directly tied to BTC in Europe. This move follows the success of its $58 billion US ETF that tracks the market’s leading cryptocurrency, underscoring BlackRock’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset space. According to Bloomberg, the new fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland. BlackRock could begin marketing the fund as soon as this month, marking a pivotal moment in the firm’s venture into European cryptocurrency products. While ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies have been available on European exchanges for several years, this will be BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETF outside of North America. As a leader in the issuance of exchange-traded funds, BlackRock manages over $4.4 trillion in assets across various products. The firm has emerged as a prominent supporter of the digital asset class, with CEO Larry Fink recently highlighting Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The launch of several US ETFs tied to Bitcoin last year ignited substantial demand for the asset class, leading to an influx of $116 billion across 12 funds to date, according to Bloomberg data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT) has notably set industry records, boasting the highest-performing debut of any Exchange-Traded Fund in history. The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant rally since the election of US President Donald Trump, with Bitcoin reaching a record high of $109,241 in January. The increasing interest from financial institutions is fueled by Trump’s vocal support for the industry and the promise of forthcoming regulations that could provide clearer guidelines for firms navigating the crypto landscape. New regulations for cryptocurrencies also went into effect in the European Union (EU) in late December 2024, further encouraging institutional participation. Despite the competitive landscape, with over 160 cryptocurrency ETPs currently available in Europe tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens, the overall market size of $17.3 billion remains modest compared to the robust US market. In a recent blog post, BlackRock executives Samara Cohen and Jay Jacobs noted that the combination of gaining Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper has proven to be an appealing option for investors. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has fallen to the $96,770 mark, losing the key $100,000 level after experiencing a 7% price drop over the weekly time frame.

We expect another round of ~Rs300bn OMOs, implying Rs900 bn+ in total in FY25E. A CRR cut is a close call, but a temporary cut may not address the underlying banking stress.

We expect a shallow rate cutting cycle of 50-75 bps over the next 9 months.” by Puneet Pal, Head-Fixed Income, PGIM India Mutual Fund. Domestic markets are expected to open strongly higher, thanks to global cues and the unwinding of short positions of foreign portfolio investors in the F&O segment. Better-than-expected results by US-listed Cognizant Technologies are likely to lift sentiment for IT stocks, said analysts. Exit polls suggesting an advantage to the BJP in the New Delhi assembly elections will also boost traders’ sentiment. Read more While a conventional 25bps rate cut in the upcoming MPC policy is less of a market debate, the actions around ‘what beyond a cut’ will be more watched. Easing by stealth via unconventional policy tools like liquidity and regulatory measures will continue. The RBI may also want to address the stress in the non-sovereign money market. We expect another round of ~Rs300bn OMOs, implying Rs900 bn+ in total in FY25E. A CRR cut is a close call, but a temporary cut may not address the underlying banking stress. Easing in ensuing tighter LCR norms (Apr-25 onwards) and lending standards might be a preferred policy tool. We will also watch for additional capital account easing actions via the FCNR route. Key Highlights: · Fiscal Prudence Maintained: The FY25 fiscal deficit is projected at 4.8%, with a target to reduce it to 4.4% in FY26. · Shift from Capex to Consumption: A ₹1 trillion consumption boost (30bps of GDP) through income tax cuts has been introduced, reducing the capex growth forecast to 9% CAGR (FY24-26) from 30% CAGR (FY14-20). · Sector Impact: Ø Positive Impact: Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), small-ticket discretionary spending (beauty, autos, consumer durables), and ITC (no cigarette tax increase). Summary: India Macro – Budget 2025: Shift from Capex to Consumption Macquarie Equity Research | February 2025 Key Highlights: Fiscal Prudence Maintained: The FY25 fiscal deficit is projected at 4.8%, with a target to reduce it to 4.4% in FY26. Shift from Capex to Consumption: A ₹1 trillion consumption boost (30bps of GDP) through income tax cuts has been introduced, reducing the capex growth forecast to 9% CAGR (FY24-26) from 30% CAGR (FY14-20). Sector Impact: Positive Impact: Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), small-ticket discretionary spending (beauty, autos, consumer durables), and ITC (no cigarette tax increase). Negative Impact: Industrials and infrastructure sentiment is weaker in the near term. Consumption Boost: · The tax rate reduction benefits 10 million people earning ₹0.7-1.2 million per year. · Private sector wage growth has lagged inflation, making tax cuts a short-term booster. Policy Outlook & Economic Growth: · Nominal GDP growth is assumed at ~10.1%, and tax buoyancy at 1.1x is considered reasonable. · The government plans structural reforms to sustain long-term growth and achieve its Viksit Bharat (Developed Nation) vision. Key Sector Implications: · Insurance: Increase in FDI cap to 100%, benefiting life insurers. · Auto: Higher disposable income will boost auto demand, benefiting TVS, Bajaj, MSIL, Hyundai, M&M. · Consumer Durables: Growth in Havells, Voltas, driven by consumption spending. · Infrastructure: Housing, power, and defense capex increased; roads and railways flat. · New Age/Consumer Stocks: Zomato, Swiggy, D-Mart to benefit from increased discretionary spending. · Industrials: Short-term negative sentiment due to lower capex allocations. MSMEs across manufacturing, trading and services (other than trading) sectors noted an uptick in their business performance in the period October-December 2024. Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) has launched their first ever MSME Outlook Survey a quarterly analysis of MSME business sentiment for the October-December 2024 period. The report, based on a pan-India survey of 1,200 MSMEs across Manufacturing, Services, and Trading sectors, captures business sentiment on 22 critical parameters, including sales growth, profitability, employment trends, financial access, cost of funds, and ease of doing business. The survey covered 77 cities (Tier 1, 2, and 3) and 66 villages across India, ensuring a diverse representation of MSME voices. Key findings indicate strong business confidence among MSMEs, particularly in the manufacturing sector reflecting optimism in sales, profitability, skilled labor availability, and access to finance for the coming quarters. Additionally, the report highlights a steady rise in digital adoption and sustainability measures across MSMEs. Shri Manoj Mittal, Chairman and Managing Director, SIDBI while releasing the report said, “MSMEs serve as the crucial foundation of the Indian economy and a powerful instrument for bringing about socioeconomic change. SIDBI has always acknowledged the incredible contribution of MSMEs in India’s growth story and is committed to the development of the sector through both financial and non-financial initiatives. The importance given to this sector by GOI is also evident from the fact that it has been identified as one of the four growth engines of the economy during the recent union budget. I firmly believe that the continuous flow of quality information on MSMEs through this survey will help all stakeholders in evaluating the current business climate and fine-tune their respective approaches. The survey also highlights: A rising commitment to sustainability, with 39% of MSMEs increasing investments in environmental protection measures such as solar panels, electric vehicles, and new technology during the quarter, and 44% planning to expand such investments in the next year. Additionally, 73% of participants found trade receivable timelines acceptable, with 14% noting an improvement from the previous quarter and 38% expecting further enhancements a year ahead. Sales growth expectations remain robust, with 43% anticipating expansion next quarter and 45% over the next year, while export optimism has surged from 22% for Oct-Dec 2024 to 36% for Oct-Dec 2025.

Title: From Quest To Horizon: How Meta's Shifting Priorities Are Affecting Developers

With concerns about declining sales and discoverability, UploadVR spoke with nearly two dozen VR studios to discuss the current state of shipping VR games on Quest. It's become increasingly apparent since last year that things are not what they once were, despite Meta's lead in VR and AR seeming unassailable. Meta's Reality Labs division is reporting record revenues, and Quest 3S seems to be selling well. Yet for many developers making VR games, the mood has soured. Some developers are buoyed by revenue through subscription programs like the Quest+ gaming catalog, with every new Quest 3S headset including three months of Quest+. However, many others are now struggling to find sales and to support their teams long-term. UploadVR spoke to developers with concerns about declining sales to learn about the current state of VR game development on Meta's store. Quest 3S seemingly had a successful launch late last year, with pack-in title Batman: Arkham Shadow reaching over one million players. Reality Labs as a whole earned its highest ever quarterly revenue last quarter. But before his departure, Meta's original technical guide through VR John Carmack warned that “setting out to build the metaverse is not the best way to wind up with the Metaverse.” Carmack noted: A memo was recently leaked from Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth noting “Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance.” 2025, it is said then, will determine whether Meta's hardware and metaverse division is “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure”. The wider video games industry continues seeing layoffs despite the industry's market value reportedly reaching around $184.3 billion. Factors cited by some include overinvestment following the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing development costs. Hearing about newly affected studios ending projects or reducing team sizes feels like a weekly occurrence and, for some, Quest is no longer delivering some studios the same returns they've once seen. The pace of complaints from developers seemed to speed up after the Meta Horizon App's redesign back in July, with many citing the transition in their interviews as a sore spot. For some, the store is still profitable, with Eye of the Temple only recouping its development costs after being ported to Meta's headset, even as Gorilla Tag cleared more than $100 million. But for developers seeing declining sales, what exactly is going wrong? Many point to issues concerning discoverability, curation, Meta's increased focus on Horizon Worlds and the decision to merge App Lab with the main store as a tipping point for revenue decline. Most studios requested anonymity in their talks with UploadVR to protect their relationships with Meta, though Andrew Eiche at Owlchemy Labs, Kevin Walker at Middle Man Games, and Alex Nasanov at iTales VR agreed to go on the record. As part of our discussion, Eiche made clear his comments are solely on his and Owlchemy's behalf and do not represent Google, which owns the veteran studio. Most developers feel Horizon Worlds is getting increased attention at the expense of store apps, mentioning it when asked how they view Meta's general direction. Several suggested this approach indicates Meta is pushing a mobile approach aimed at younger audiences, trying to entice young players who have no wallets by prioritizing free-to-play content. They perceive Meta as promoting Horizon Worlds as the default experience for VR users rather than paid apps on the storefront. “This is not the direction I would have chosen,” Andrew Eiche said over a video call with UploadVR. “I think they made a video game console and they want a general computing device.” Notably, Dimensional Double Shift from Owlchemy released as a free multiplayer app on Meta's storefront after a string of paid releases. Technically, this content type isn't supported by Horizon Worlds, which still requires physical input of some kind. Multiple developers sent us pages of screenshots of search results featuring what look like Horizon Worlds clones of premium games competing with paid work, and sometimes winning in search rankings. “This is bad for us devs. It's bad for consumers,” states Kevin Walker. “And when they show free [Gorilla Tag] clones above paid apps, I don't see how it's even good for Meta.” Eiche and others praised the Quest Store for what it's delivered in the past, with multiple platinum releases clearing one million units. Others understand Meta's priorities, but the prevailing sentiment in our talks with developers is concern and frustration. Here's a series of selected direct quotes from the developers with paid releases on the Quest Store who wished to remain anonymous: Horizon Worlds and its free destinations competing for search, promotion, and time in VR is one aspect of paid store developer frustrations, but Meta also stopped curating content on the storefront more generally in 2024. Many studios criticized the lasting impact of Meta getting rid of App Lab last year, which arrived in two stages. Scott Albright, CEO for Combat Waffle Studios, previously told UploadVR last year that he wasn't a fan of App Lab being discontinued, and that sentiment's only grown. Many developers see the move to make the store “open” as being a good one overall because it lowers barriers to entry. One studio called it “an inevitable step” for any platform looking to grow, and a positive change. That same developer, however, suggested Meta “wasn’t ready to manage the vast amount of very unpolished content and the lack of a warning time.” “I believe that this has also shifted the type of content that gets visibility on the store now and, as a consequence, opened up its doors for developers with new approaches to VR game development and also new ways of monetization. This has caused legacy devs and publishers having to adapt to new times, which takes a while,” said another developer. Here's another set of direct quotations from developers on their issues with the changes around curation: Some studios consider the removal process was rushed, though others argue that App Lab wasn't really merged in. One team says Meta “removed the main store” and put everyone on App Lab. Eiche says they changed the store to be like Google Play or Apple's App Store, though he concedes there are arguments both ways with an open platform. In recent times, the Horizon Store's home page seems to have improved when searching on desktop or inside the headset. Though the mobile app still prioritizes mobile Horizon Worlds content when you load it up, with no means to adjust this, the desktop homepage begins by highlighting the most popular apps and top-selling that week. But it is not long before you reach the 'Browse All' category, where listed entries often have some variation on the words “Gorilla,” “Tag” or “monkey.” These often outrank Gorilla Tag itself due to inflated ratings from a small number of users. Many of those we spoke with view the Quest Store's current discoverability poorly, and worse than Steam. One developer likened it to entering a department store filled with cheap clothes during the holidays. One studio called being discovered their biggest issue next to funding, while another said navigating the store has become “unnecessarily difficult.” Another expressed frustrations that promised support over marketing and reaching the main store never materialized. Adding mixed reality labels on the developer dashboard side are still curated by Meta, yet other genres are not. Some genres in the developer settings aren’t reflected as filters on the actual store, which is causing some frustrations, while others don't show the full selection of games in a specific genre. Just how badly have developers been affected saleswise? The exact percentage naturally varies depending on who you ask, but some of those who aren't supported by a platform subscription program suggest revenue drop-offs for their games between 50 - 80% for 2024 compared to 2023. Sales impact was much more visible in the second half of 2024 for many. One studio explains that developers usually expect a big spike in sales when a new headset launches, even more so when you factor in Christmas sales. One studio says that didn't happen with Quest 3S, despite retailers like Amazon reporting high sales. “When Quest 3s launched, you couldn't even tell from the sales data that a new and affordable headset had launched… I think that this is not necessarily due to Quest 3s selling so much less, but due to those players not reaching the store and buying games,” states one studio. One developer believes Meta should implement more mechanisms like Steam Daily Deals to provide indie titles enough sales to cover months of costs. Another points toward both declining sales across the entire gaming industry and a shift toward younger audiences. “This demographic typically spends less compared to adult gamers, raising the question: where have the adult VR gamers gone?” Of course, games aren't guaranteed to be a success at launch, no matter the platform. Even with strong reviews and great marketing, games sometimes just fail to land with an audience for a myriad of reasons. Critical success doesn't equal commercial success and, for a niche market, the end of 2024 delivered a relentless stream of new releases. From October to December, the following games saw release on various platforms: And that's just some of the list. I've never seen such a hefty lineup of big VR games released in such a short timeframe. Some of that could be attributed to the Quest 3S launch, and while most developers we spoke with didn't have the most positive results, it's not impossible to break through or at least get close. In a separate interview outside this report, Flat2VR Studios advised Trombone Champ: Unflattened was close to hitting sales expectations despite the fierce competition. So there's a mix of heavy competition, poor discoverability, search issues, increasing promotion of Horizon Worlds, and a userbase that perhaps isn’t big enough to support such a wide range of games. This hasn't gone well for many, set in context of wider economic issues like the increasing cost of living leaving people with less disposable income. “There's a bigger, more insidious core problem that's happening. The amount of money that consumers are willing to spend on apps that you pay for is shrinking,” Eiche said. Owlchemy doesn't believe declining sales are necessarily due to games reaching the tail-end of their life cycle. He suggested Vacation Simulator and Cosmonious High — which recently received price cuts — have discoverability issues, while Job Simulator still regularly charts in the top 10. Even in such a high spot though, Owlchemy's debut hit is making less money than it once did. “I would love to be like, 'Hey, Job Simulator had a great run.' That's great. But then when I see it in the top 10 or in the top four but the amount it's making is an order of magnitude less, like half as much as it did before,” Eiche said. “That to me says that the overall amount of money being put into the store is shrinking.” This doesn't necessarily mean there are fewer Quest users, but it suggests more are opting for free-to-play experiences over premium content. Meta Quest+ is a subscription program providing access to two pre-selected monthly games and a rotating selection of VR titles via its Games Catalog. It's drawn the inevitable comparisons with Xbox Game Pass, and Sony's own PlayStation Plus service. Meta includes a 3-month subscription with every new Quest 3S headset, meaning anyone who received a headset over Christmas still has this. For some developers, revenue from the programs can close the gap with revenue lost from store sales. Releasing games on Quest+ immediately feels like a “double-edged sword” to some though, with games failing to reach sustainability across both store and subscription channels. Another developer expressed skepticism about subscriptions wholesale, calling the model a “catastrophic disaster” for the music industry. Others just see it as a new name for curation at Meta. “It is a great option and helps users discover great content BUT it cannot be [the] only method for doing so,” one developer said. “Which currently it is.” Some believe Quest+ gives users fewer reasons to go looking for games to purchase, stating this complements Meta's push with moving users to free apps. Despite this, most developers agreed the subscription service is great for consumers. “Quest+ is a form of curation because anything where you pick out apps is a form of curation. I think that's another line of business,” says Andrew Eiche, who calls Quest+ a good way of recommending titles. “I don’t see Meta pushing that as the answer.” With declining Quest sales being a common issue across these studios, has this lead to an uplift in sales across other headsets for multiplatform developers? Based on the developers we spoke with, generally no, but with a few notable exceptions: Still, the exceptions are interesting to note. For example, Into The Radius hit 800k sales while its currently PC VR only sequel reached nearly $3m revenue in early access so far. One CEO reported 90% of sales came from Steam compared to Quest, attributing this to being featured on the Steam front page after participating in themed sales and festivals. Another developer saw 2024 on Steam outperform their sales in 2023 and 2022. Even with Quest being their main source of revenue, one studio advised the difference with Steam is “shrinking more and more.” One studio told UploadVR lower than expected sales on Quest means they'll be focusing on multiplatform launches in the future, naming Steam as a certainty, while PS VR2 and Android XR are “maybe.” GDC's State of the Industry report, which surveyed 3500 developers, advised 59% of VR developers are working on Quest/Horizon games, 31% for SteamVR, 16% for PS VR2, and 8% for Apple visionOS. PlayStation VR2 also appears to be another beneficiary following decreased sales on Quest. Across the last few months, we've seen an increasing number of developers announce ports for Sony's headset. Sinn Studio co-founder Almir Brljak confirmed that Swordsman VR “sold more copies” on PS VR2 than Quest in December, calling the Sony headset's pricing “a huge barrier.” While not a direct indicator of sales, Skydance's Behemoth and Metro Awakening all show more user reviews on PS VR2 than Quest, though Steam shows the highest review count for Metro. Touching upon Into The Radius' success, Fast Travel Games CMO Andreas Juliusson recently stated that sales on PS VR2 “exceeded our expectations.” Elsewhere, Toast Interactive's VR platformer Max Mustard sold better on Sony's headset than Quest in the first two weeks. Some of this can be attributed to the specific audience. Max Mustard likely benefitted fulfilling a genre desire when Astro Bot lacked PS VR2 support, despite Rescue Mission being a PSVR hit, while Into The Radius and Swordsman would suggest PlayStation VR2 owners also prefer more “hardcore” experiences. Even then, one studio behind a more casual game revealed surprising sales. “We have similar numbers on Meta as we do on Steam, but much higher on PlayStation. Given the size of these platforms, it’s unclear to us how this is even possible,” a studio representative said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the increasing struggle with sales on Quest and VR in general, two studios advised they're looking more toward flatscreen gaming. Whether that's for hybrid titles going forward or flatscreen-only wasn't specified, though it's clear these decisions are motivated by financial struggles. “Compared to non-VR sales, it is increasingly feeling like we shouldn't bother with VR or MR at all,” one studio tells me, stating sales for their game's flatscreen edition on Steam outperforms the VR edition on Quest by 500%. “In my opinion, the Quest Store is not on a good path. As a result, we will see a good amount of VR studios close or pivot to non-VR in the next years, leading to a big drop in quality games 2-3 years down the line,” said one developer. A couple of developers expected layoffs and closures from many that don't pivot to flatscreen titles. With PowerWash Simulator VR support being officially dropped, other studios evidently aren't finding Quest profitable, though FuturLab's port faced criticisms at launch. Crucially, this avoided layoffs and saw the staff members redeployed to other projects. Eiche described this as a “smart business decision” because FuturLab didn’t wait until layoffs became inevitable. The last two years for many VR studios have been rough. The wider games industry remains in a rough state, tens of thousands of developers have lost their jobs and VR gaming has been hit too. WIMO Games, Archiact, First Contact Entertainment, Sony's London Studio, and Ready At Dawn have all shut down since 2023. Other big names hit by layoffs include nDreams, Lode, TinyBuild, Codemasters, VRChat, Soul Assembly, XR Games, Toast Interactive, Resolution Games, Firesprite, Humble Games, Supermassive Games, Downpour Interactive and, most recently, Fast Travel Games. We've received emails from folks looking for contract positions as some studio heads look to “work for hire” jobs to keep their workers employed. “I can still get by because I'm solo, but if I had employees there would be no way this would be sustainable,” one developer said. Some developers also highlighted their worries about Meta's recent changes to its content moderation policies across Threads, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, which includes removing fact-checking. These recent moves saw CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused of aligning himself with President Trump before his inauguration last month. Meta faced heavy criticism both from platform users and its own staff over its updated community standards guidelines, with many worried about the rise of hate speech, homophobia, misogyny, transphobia, and more. Meta also removed transgender and non-binary themes from Messenger, killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and removed accommodations for transgender staff. The current Hateful Conduct guidelines as of February 4, 2025, state the following: “We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality.” Meta Quest and Horizon Worlds use a separate Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences. Meta defines “hate-based organizations” in another policy at the company, with a page noting “we cannot estimate prevalence for organized hate right now.” Meta's moderation landscape is changing rapidly, and its efforts to scale toward billions of users continues to bend heavily toward automated systems at multiple layers. Evidence recently emerged via VR enthusiast Lunayian that Meta could be dropping moderators reviewing the last few mins of audio/video after you report other users in Horizon Worlds. One developer questioned how much longer they can ethically do business with such an organization. We intend to explore this particular area further fully in a separate report. If you have information to share with us, or in particular a developer looking to share your thoughts on Meta's recent moderation changes, please use our Contact Us page to get in touch or email me: hstockdale@uploadvr.com. Where does this leave the VR market? If you're a VR gamer, some months may seem like there are more older games getting VR mods than new VR games. Even so, there's still a slow but steady drip of indie releases from small teams, as well as occasional tentpoles from well-funded groups with dozens of artists working on a single project. Some developers are hopeful things will change for the better at Meta, while others cannot wait for Valve's rumored Deckard headset. Many praised Meta for keeping the VR market as vibrant as it has been, though another conceded VR adoption has been “slower than expected.” Another criticized the infrastructure around the platform as “suffering from serious growing pains.” One developer believes Meta is shaping the industry in an “unsustainable” direction that’s good for retention from younger audiences – free-to-play – but bad for overall revenue. Others cited concerns about the market shifting so rapidly, while one expressed caution about chasing mixed reality experiences at the expense of VR. One studio cited shifting goalposts during development on Quest as a problem, while another believes mixed reality made some developers “forget about VR.” Clear investments are being made into pushing Horizon Worlds and that's particularly true on mobile, though some remain hopeful that Meta can be persuaded into course correction. In preparation for this article, we reached out to Meta this week with a bulleted list of complaints from developers and questions we're hoping the company can answer. We were told they're preparing a blog post and will update with a link to that post once it is live. As part of our reporting, UploadVR initially put a call-out for responses to a consumer survey. However, this did not receive a wide enough response to be considered viable data for the report. For transparency, we've included a link to the full results here.

Title: BlackRock To List New Spot Bitcoin ETP in Europe Following Big Success of US Product: Report

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly going to list a new spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, its first digital asset-related venture into the continent. According to a new report from Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – is getting ready to launch a BTC ETP in Europe after its US iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) was a massive success. Anonymous people familiar with the matter say that the ETP will be based out of Switzerland and that BlackRock could start advertising the fund as soon as sometime this month. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ETPs allow traders to expose themselves to assets – such as precious metals and crypto – without having to actually physically purchase them. BlackRock first launched IBIT in January 2024 after years of having its bid delayed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Previously, Bloomberg found that IBIT had the best debut out of all other US BTC ETFs. At the time, it was found that IBIT held more assets than BlackRock’s Gold ETF despite it being launched nearly two decades earlier in 2005. According to BlackRock’s official website, the net assets of IBIT are $57.4 billion while Bloomberg reports that Europe’s total crypto ETP market is sized at around $17.3 billion. IBIT is trading for $56.09 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day while the top crypto asset by market cap is valued at $98,146.

Title: Google's Finances Are in Chaos as the Company Flails at Unpopular AI

Google's parent company Alphabet failed to hit sales targets, falling a 0.1 percent short of Wall Street's revenue expectations — a fraction of a point that's seen the company's stock slide almost eight percent today, in its worst performance since October 2023. It's also a sign of the times: as the New York Times reports, the whiff was due to slower-than-expected growth of its cloud-computing division, which delivers its AI tools to other businesses. While a reported $96.5 billion in revenue versus the expected $96.6 billion sounds well within a margin of error, it shows that even for a company of Google's scale and stature, actually making money off AI — even on the infrastructure side — is still a risky business. That's despite Alphabet committing a whopping $75 billion on capital expenditures as it builds out AI infrastructure, $22 billion more than just last year, following the lead of its competitors in the AI space, including Meta. Everyone's pouring money in, but it's as unclear as ever when the industry will start generating meaningful revenue — and for how many players. Investors are also still reeling from the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which shook Silicon Valley to its core last week. The company's ultra-lean and highly efficient AI models — that can be trained for a tiny fraction of the price of Western competitors but still keep up — caught the AI industry by surprise, wiping out over $1 trillion in market value in a single day. Is Alphabet's latest earnings result the canary in the coal mine? Should the AI industry brace for tougher days ahead as investors become increasingly skeptical of what the tech has to offer? Or are investors concerned over OpenAI's ChatGPT overtaking Google's search engine? Illustrating the drama, this week Google appears to have retroactively edited the YouTube video of a Super Bowl ad for its core AI model called Gemini, to remove an extremely obvious error the AI made about the popularity of gouda cheese. "Although it’s still well insulated, Google’s advantages in search hinge on its ubiquity and entrenched consumer behavior," Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf told The Guardian. This year "could be the year those advantages meaningfully erode as antitrust enforcement and open-source AI models change the game," she added. "And Cloud’s disappointing results suggest that AI-powered momentum might be beginning to wane just as Google’s closed model strategy is called into question by DeepSeek."

Title: Here’s What Happened After Elon Musk Cut 80% Of X’s Employees—As He Eyes Reshaping Federal Workforce

Time Published: 2025-02-05T21:14:59Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk’s campaign to get rid of 10% of the U.S.’ 2.3 million-strong federal workforce, including all 10,000 employees in the U.S. Agency for International Development, has little historic precedent, but it does evoke memories of the world’s richest man’s 2022 takeover of social media company Twitter, now known as X. Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and quickly slashed its headcount. Just six months after closing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Musk told the BBC he culled the company’s headcount to 1,500, down about 80% from 7,500 employees as of the end of 2021, as noted in the company’s last annual report as a public company. The dramatic restructuring came as a result of firings and voluntary resignation packages as the social media company pivoted to Musk’s “extremely hardcore” culture, laid out in an all-hands email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road.” That’s the same subject line all federal employees got last week in their email offering voluntary buyouts, an offer about 20,000—or 1%—of workers have taken thus far, while Musk and his allies have orchestrated the administrative leave of almost all USAID employees. The social media company initially took a massive financial hit as its workforce shrank. Its advertising revenue in 2023, Musk’s first full year at the helm of X, declined to a reported $2.5 billion, a more than 45% decrease from Twitter’s ad sales in 2021, its final full year as a public company, causing Fidelity to write down its valuation of X to as little as $9 billion by last September, just a fifth of the sticker price Musk paid two years prior. After Musk’s takeover, the company overhauled its operations, cutting its content moderation and communications teams, and reshaped its platform, focusing on premium monthly subscriptions and algorithm-based feeds like TikTok’s. To a degree, yes. In recent months, X has begun to show signs of recovery. Fidelity upped its X valuation to about $13 billion in December and several major advertisers, including Amazon, are renewing their presence on the platform. X’s financials recovered in 2024 on its leaner model, as Bloomberg reports X brought in $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings last year, within striking distance of 2021’s $1.4 billion, with a much leaner staff. X’s recent rebound traces back to Musk’s chummy relationship with President Donald Trump, but Musk’s activities outside of his corporate role are a big part of why the company landed in hot water in the first place. Major companies like Disney and Apple paused ads on X in late 2023 after Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, while others balked at the lack of content guardrails on the site. Very. The Musk-led push to trim 6,000 positions at X, a much smaller scale than the government job cuts he hopes to oversee, brought significant legal challenges from employees—including more than 2,000 arbitration cases, after X did not pay the severance package Musk promised, and several broader lawsuits. The fate of those lawsuits has been mixed: A federal judge tossed one lawsuit accusing him of skimping on a half-billion in severance payments, while another severance-based suit was allowed to proceed in part. Musk is taking “the same Twitter playbook now with the federal government," Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney representing many of the former Twitter/X employees in arbitration against their former employer, told NPR. "And he couldn't even come up with a new subject line for the email,” Liss-Riordan continued. In the latest signal of institutional confidence in X, banks which helped finance Musk’s 2022 acquisition plan to sell $5.5 billion of X’s debt at 97 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Government agencies do not have a similar catch-all performance metric as corporations do with the yardstick of profit, but Musk’s private sector resume shows clear evidence of operational efficiency leadership. Tesla, Musk’s most valuable company and the primary source of his wealth, grew to be an investor favorite due to its high profit margins compared to other car companies, made possible in part by its relatively lean headcount. Tesla had 141,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2023, compared to Ford’s 177,000 and General Motors’ 163,000, according to the company’s most recent proxy statements. And yet Tesla brought in $10.9 billion in net income in 2023, besting Ford’s $8.1 billion net profit and General Motors’ $10.5 billion despite the legacy automakers’ higher headcount. Musk is worth $400 billion, according to Forbes' calculations, making him the world's richest person by a roughly $150 billion margin. X accounted for less than $7 billion of his fortune as of November. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Report: Amazon Employees Say Restructuring Leaves Fewer Opportunities to Advance
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2025/report-amazon-employees-say-restructuring-leaves-fewer-opportunities-to-advance/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T21:11:01Z

Amazon’s efforts to restructure its workforce have reportedly left staffers with fewer opportunities to move up the corporate ladder. These concerns result from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to reduce the company’s middle management ranks and free up funds for its investments in data centers and artificial intelligence, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Feb. 5). To reduce costs, the company’s organizations have been told to hire recent college graduates, find reasons to remove more senior workers, and have fewer managers as compared to front-line workers, according to the report. Most employees interviewed by Bloomberg said Amazon had become a less desirable place to work, per the report. Together with the reduction in the number of opportunities to advance their careers, some cited the company’s cutbacks on projects like cashierless checking and telehealth and its requirement to return to the office five days a week. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told Bloomberg, per the report, that the reduction in the number of managers “impacts a relatively small subset of employees and aims to increase our team members’ ability to move fast, clarify and strengthen their sense of ownership, and drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most affects customers and the business. Each organization is determining the best way to reach this goal, and our internal surveys show that employee sentiment remains strong.” Jassy wrote in a message shared with Amazon’s employees and posted online in September that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In the case of managers, Jassy said Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Amazon began a series of layoffs in November 2022, with Jassy saying at the time that the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years. In January 2023, he said the number of layoffs would amount to more than 18,000. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Or Bitcoin and gold? Investors are weighing where to put their money in times of uncertainty—and no time is more uncertain than now. President Donald Trump’s tariffs—or threats of tariffs—have rocked markets, making “risk-on” assets like crypto less appealing. The price of gold hit a new high Monday, while Bitcoin dropped below $93,000, down about 14% from its all-time high price set on January 20. Bitcoin's correlation to the precious metal is down significantly as investors flock to more traditional safe haven assets, experts told Decrypt. Bitcoin proponents have long claimed that the cryptocurrency’s unique selling point is that it’s a long-term store of value—like gold. And sometimes, they are correlated: The two assets have moved in tandem in the past, when investors have flocked to a strong dollar. But things are up in the air now that President Donald Trump has taken office and issued a flurry of dramatic orders, and Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with gold has remained close to zero, data provider Kaiko told Decrypt. Case in point: The new commander in chief implemented tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China on Saturday, causing crypto prices to drop sharply. After having a “friendly conversation” with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum two days later, he decided to pause tariffs—leading to a rebound in Bitcoin’s price. Meanwhile, gold soared. Trump later agreed to a similar pause with Canada as the two countries attempt to work out a deal, while tariffs against China ultimately did go into effect. “The trade war could decouple the correlation in the short term as gold is a more established ‘safe haven’ asset, while Bitcoin—although often seen as a safe haven—is currently owned by a large investor base also trading highly speculative risk-asset meme coins and tech stocks,” Amberdata’s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. The reason for the decoupling is that Bitcoin is still performing less like a safe-haven and more like risk assets, such as tech stocks. The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap over the past seven days alone has swung from $105,893 per coin to as low as $92,876, CoinGecko shows. “While Bitcoin has indisputably drawn investors as a similarly alternative store of value, its higher volatility makes it less reliable in times of economic uncertainty compared to gold,” Michael Petch, co-founder and president of gold investment platform Argo, told Decrypt. Bitcoin as an asset is still finding its feet, say some (including Wall Street titan BlackRock), and even though its long-term gains by far outmatch gold, for now the 5,000-year old physical asset is still the go-to safe haven during times of chaos. “Investors don’t like uncertainty and Donald Trump brings a lot of uncertainty,” RIA Advisors portfolio manager Michael Lebowitz told Decrypt.

Big Tech’s earnings season is nearly over, with just Amazon and Nvidia left to announce their quarterly performance. And despite uneven reports from some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names so far, AI continues to be the star of the show for Wall Street. Microsoft (MSFT) missed on cloud revenue, Meta (META) said sales growth would slow in the current quarter, Apple (AAPL) fell short of iPhone revenue estimates, and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) disappointed on cloud growth. President Trump’s tariffs on goods out of China, which have kicked off a tit-for-tat trade battle that’s pulling in Google and Apple, and the emergence of DeepSeek’s low-cost AI models haven’t helped things either. But analysts aren’t overly concerned, focusing instead on Big Tech’s long-term AI bets. “Tech sector volatility is likely to continue in the months ahead. But we see the initial set of large-cap tech results as reassuring and believe the AI growth story remains intact,” UBS’s Chief Investment Office team wrote in its Daily Updates note. Nvidia (NVDA), the AI trade’s bellwether, doesn’t report its earnings until Feb. 26, and a miss on earnings or outlook could send AI stocks off the rails. But for now, it’s all about AI’s future. Microsoft and Meta kicked off earnings last week, with both companies beating analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines. But dig deeper and the beats start to look less impressive. Microsoft reported cloud revenue of $40 billion in the quarter, shy of the $41.1 billion Wall Street was looking for. The company’s Intelligence Cloud platform, which includes Azure services, came up short too, posting revenue of $25.5 billion on expectations of $25.8 billion. Microsoft said part of the problem had to do with demand outpacing its available capacity for cloud services and that non-AI cloud services were lower than expected because it’s working to “balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth.” Despite that, AI services grew 157% year over year and contributed 13 percentage points of growth to Azure overall. “While investors wanted a more pronounced 2H [acceleration] from Azure, we continue to believe [Microsoft] is the predominant software AI winner,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note to investors. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood says cloud capacity should meet customers’ needs by the end of the company’s fiscal 2025. Meta, for its part, declined to provide full-year guidance for its fiscal 2025, but pointed to growth opportunities via its heavy AI investments. The company is planning to spend upwards of $65 billion building out its AI services this year, including launching its next-generation Llama 4 AI model. Meta also pushed back against fears that DeepSeek’s low-cost AI is a danger to its business, something Pivotal Research Group’s Jeffrey Wlodarczak agreed with in his investor note following the company’s earnings report. “We expect [Meta’s] open-source Llama AI to emulate the best of DeepSeek’s techniques, which should allow Llama to take the lead in AI given likely significantly lower costs than their peers for best-in-class AI products boosted materially by the fact it is US based and open-sourced which will attract developers,” Wlodarczak wrote. Google parent Alphabet’s stock plummeted Wednesday after coming up short on cloud revenue in the prior quarter. Like Microsoft, Google laid the blame on greater demand for its cloud services than is currently available. The fix? Spending $75 billion in 2025 on its AI build-out. That’s up from the $57.9 billion analysts were anticipating. The hope, among analysts and investors, is that those billions help even out Google’s supply and demand imbalance. “We continue to see a favorable risk/reward for Alphabet and think there is a case for multiple expansion in the coming quarters as investors gain more comfort related to infrastructure spending, regulatory risk, and the impact of generative AI on Google Search,” Wedbush’s Scott Devitt wrote in an investor note. Then there’s Apple, which like Microsoft and Meta, beat analysts’ expectations on earnings per share and revenue. But the company fell short of Wall Street’s anticipations on iPhone sales, reporting revenue of $69.1 billion on expectations of $71 billion. Apple’s Apple Intelligence AI platform was supposed to help buoy iPhone sales, but with the service only available in English, it’s missing out on a large portion of its user base, especially in China. The company says it will launch Apple Intelligence in more languages in the coming months. CEO Tim Cook also said iPhone sales performed better where Apple Intelligence is available, indicating that the platform is helping to drive upgrades, something that is sure to please investors if it holds true for other regions. Now Apple, like the rest of its Big Tech cohort, just needs to deliver on its AI promises. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the event will include news from its Alexa team. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, will also be in attendance, according to invites sent to media. Amazon has been racing to release a new version of its voice-activated Alexa software that has more advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. It is responding to increased competition in generative AI from rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, as well as Claude, the chatbot created by AI startup Anthropic, which has raised billions of dollars from Amazon and other investors. Amazon executives have scheduled a "Go/No-go" meeting for Feb. 14 in preparation for releasing the souped-up Alexa to the public, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The company first previewed a redesigned Alexa in 2023, showing off a live conversation between an Amazon executive and the voice assistant as part of a yet-to-be-released feature called Let's Chat. Amazon shared few details following that event about further Alexa updates, and it did not hold its typical fall event in 2024, at which it typically announces new products. CNBC reported last year that Amazon was preparing to revamp Alexa with AI features, and that it would charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology. In October, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told investors the new Alexa could launch "in the near future," adding that the company is working to "rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models." Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across Amazon since late 2022, and the company's devices and services unit, which includes Alexa, has been hit by several rounds of layoffs. Since its launch in 2014, Alexa has not shaped up to be the money maker Amazon anticipated. While hundreds of millions of customers have Alexa-enabled devices in their homes, Amazon has struggled to monetize the products. The company has traditionally launched devices at extremely cheap prices with the goal of promoting its other products and services. That idea has not been as successful as Amazon hoped, and the company has lost tens of billions of dollars on its devices business, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The shares of Kyndryl (KD) are advancing 6% after Scotiabank increased its price target on the tech name to $45 from $35. The cloud services company was spun off from IBM (IBM) in 2021. Why Scotiabank Is Bullish on KD The bank raised its price target on KD after it unveiled higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings per share and in-line fiscal Q3 sales on Monday. Scotiabank kept an Outperform rating on KD. A data analyst in a lab monitoring a cloud-based software system to detect cardiac disease. Scotiabank believes that Kyndryl's embrace of automation, artificial intelligence, and analytics has helped the firm increase its profit margins and create value for investors. The bank noted that KD's consulting business, driven by the rapid proliferation of AI and cloud security systems, is expanding by double-digit percentage levels. The latter unit's growth, in turn, is creating new opportunities for its Managed Services unit, according to Scotiabank. The bank believes that the company is well-managed, while its services are necessary for its customers, leaving it largely insulated from negative macroeconomic catalysts. More Information About KD Analysts on average expect KD's earnings per share to climb to $1.23 this year from a per-share loss of 11 cents in 2024. In the last month, the shares have gained 13%, while they have soared 77% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of KD, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI and the cloud in focus for Wall Street as analysts grow bullish ahead of earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-q4-earnings-preview-aws-cloud-ai-holiday-consumers-analysts-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-05T19:14:28Z

Amazon said it will continue spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure and signaled that it's not afraid of cheaper competitors during its call on Thursday. CFO Brian Olsavsky indicated that capital expenditures for 2025 could total just over $100 billion, with most of that going to AWS and Amazon's AI efforts, he said. He also pushed back on concerns about cheaper AI options, such as DeepSeek, saying that customers will keep spending on the technology. CEO Andy Jassy said that AWS could grow even faster, if it wasn't hindered by data center capacity constraints. Amazon is the latest Big Tech company to say it will continue investing in AI. Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all said that they'll keep investing billions to add capacity, even as pressure builds from investors to demonstrate returns on investment. Amazon's quarterly earnings beat Wall Street's estimates, but lighter-than-expected guidance weighed on the shares in after-market trading. Shares were trading over 4% lower after the company held its earnings call. The tech giant reported net sales of $187.79 billion, compared to estimates of $187.32 billion, while earnings per share came in at $1.86, compared to $1.50. Sales in its key Amazon Web Services cloud segment were slightly light at $28.79 billion compared to expectations of $28.82 billion. Guidance for the current first quarter was also lighter than anticipated, with revenue forecasts of between $151 billion to $155.5 billion, short of Wall Street's expectations of $158.64 billion. Amazon's stock closed 1% higher on Thursday. The shares are up almost 9% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500's 3% gain. Amazon's stock is trading 4.4% lower after-hours as the call ends. One analyst asks about UPS's decision to deliver fewer packages for Amazon. Jassy replied that UPS found some of Amazon's deliveries too low-profitability — similar to the reason UPS gave for downsizing its business with Amazon. Amazon built up its own logistics infrastructure during the pandemic, which meant it could carry more packages and saved money, Jassy said. That means that Amazon will be able to pick up the slack itself, he added. "We were impressed with what DeepSeek has done," Jassy said, including "some of the training techniques, primarily, and flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training, reinforcement learning being earlier without the human in the loop." He adds that there will be room for multiple different models, each good for a different purpose and that Amazon wants to provide as many options for customers as possible. Despite worries in recent weeks about cheaper models like DeepSeek, Jassy said that the cost of inference will fall — and that will be a good thing for tech companies. "Sometimes, people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference, that somehow it's going to lead to less total spend in technology," he said. "We have never seen that to be the case," Jassy added. The $26.3 billion that Amazon spent on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter — a run rate that will be "reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate," CFO Olsavsky said. Doing the math, that would be about $105 billion in spending for 2025. The "vast majority" of capex is on AI and AWS, execs said. Like 2024, most of that spending will "support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments," he adds. Amazon's shares are trading more than 5% down after the remarks. Amazon CEO Jassy references the latest Trainium chips, saying that "most AI computing has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future." "However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet, and when you get there, like we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly," he said. CEO Andy Jassy, CFO Brian Olsavsky, and head of investor relations Dave Fildes are on the call. Growth at AWS "did not accelerate as anticipated and instead matched Q3 levels, indicating that the company is challenged by the same types of capacity constraints facing rivals Google and Microsoft," Sky Canaves, principal analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said. A brighter spot during the quarter was Amazon's holiday sales performance, which Canaves called "relatively strong for US retail." "We estimate that Amazon accounted for nearly half of US e-commerce growth during the holidays, and will gain share of overall online sales over the course of 2025, especially as low-cost rivals like Temu and Shein will be more heavily impacted by recent tariff developments," Canaves said. Analysts will be listening for any guidance about Amazon's planned spending on AI this year. It seemed to have an initial response in its earnings press release, saying benefits from AWS innovation are "often realized by customers (and the business) several months down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment and we're excited to see what customers build." Other big tech names have indicated that they are willing to spend on AI so far this earnings season. Google parent company Alphabet said this week that its capital expenditures will reach $75 billion for 2025. Meta is planning to spend $60 billion to $65 billion for the year, it said last month. And Microsoft expects that spending, mostly on AI data centers, will amount to $80 billion for the year. Haul, Amazon's answer to low-price shopping sites like Temu and AliExpress, got a shoutout in the earnings press release as a "new shopping experience" launched during the fourth quarter. Amazon launched Haul in November. Like Temu, its products ship to customers directly from China and cost less than $20. The model relies on a de minimis exemption that was the target of an executive order from President Donald Trump earlier this month. 4th quarter Net sales $187.79 billion, +10% y/y, estimate $187.32 billion Operating income $21.20 billion, +61% y/y, estimate $18.84 billion Source: Bloomberg Consumer strength and rising demand for AI should put Amazon ahead of consensus expectations, Deutsche Bank said. The industry's growing embrace of Amazon's cloud service means that AWS could contribute to Amazon's expected operating income beat of $21 billion. "These trends alone (accelerating AWS revenue and a measured stance to headcount growth) should support at least $1bn of OI upside relative to the Street in the 4Q, to say nothing of the upside that should flow through the global e-commerce business," the bank said. Although Amazon may face stiffer headwinds from a strengthening dollar, operating income estimates should still rise higher after the earnings report. Deutsche Bank has a $275 price target on Amazon, about 15% higher than current levels. Amazon stands to gain from what looks to be an improving consumer backdrop, Mizuho said. Fourth-quarter ad-spend growth and price improvements across discretionary and staple products are displaying positive trajectories. "With that in mind, we feel good about the ecommerce revenue growth in 4Q24 and more importantly, the expected margin leverage from inbound logistics," the note said. The outperformance of AWS cloud service, retail margin expansions, and capital efficiencies add to Amazon's favorable risk/reward proposition, the analysts said. Mizuho has an "Outperform" rating on Amazon stock and holds a price target of $285, 20% higher than current levels. Wedbush Securities projects that the e-commerce giant will earn $20.7 billion in fourth-quarter operating income, outpacing initial 2024 expectations by more than 40%. This "exceptional" year of profit growth will repeat in 2025, and Wedbush sees full-year operating income beating consensus by 5%. Investors are too conservative about the firm's margin potential, given needless concern about the rising AI and satellite costs, as well as Amazon's decision to not increase Fulfillment fees. "We believe there is upside to expectations for 4Q results and 1Q guidance given the strength of the underlying retail environment, continued fulfillment optimization, improvements in international retail margin, and an ongoing mix shift to higher-margin AWS and advertising revenue," analysts wrote. Wedbush maintains an "Outperform" rating on Amazon. It increased its price target to $280, implying an 18% gain from current levels. Morgan Stanley equity analyst Brian Nowak is bullish on Amazon over its latest advances in warehouse robotics, making it an underappreciated AI winner in retail. For every 10% of units passing through robotic-enabled warehouses by 2030, Amazon could unlock up to $3 billion in annual recurring savings. "Early signals are promising too, with Amazon's latest fulfillment center in Shreveport, LA (opened in September 2024 as the first fulfillment center bringing together the full fleet of its latest robotics innovations), delivering 25% lower 'cost-to-serve' (fulfillment cost) during peak periods," Nowak wrote. Fulfillment costs make up nearly 20% of retail revenue, he added, making automation a serious long-term positive Morgan Stanley holds an "Overweight" rating on Amazon and a $280 price target, indicating 18% upside from current levels. Amazon should deliver a solid fourth-quarter report, as holiday-boosted retail growth will deliver an above-consensus operating profit of $19.7 billion. The firm's AWS cloud platform will likely meet expectations for 19% to 20% growth, BofA said, thanks to rising AI contributions. Drivers to cloud demand include, "Amazon's growing partnership with Anthropic, new competitive AI offerings (including Nova models and lower infrastructure costs on Trainium), and ramping GPU supply (greater Nvidia chip supply as well as the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips & cloud products)." But there are risks moving forward. The bank lowered its first-quarter revenue amid tariff and currency headwinds and cited that AWS margins may have peaked in 2024 amid favorable demand. BofA maintains a "Buy" rating on Amazon and a price objective of $255, or 8% above the firm's current share price. 4th quarter Net sales estimate: $187.32 billion Operating income estimate: $18.84 billion 1st quarter (Source: Bloomberg data) Jump to

The largest asset manager in the world is buying the Ethereum dip to custody funds for its ETH-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock’s data, the firm picked up 100,535 ETH – worth about $276.2 million at time of writing – for its iShares ETHA product. BlackRock holds a total of 1,352,934 ETH worth roughly $3.71 billion, and the financial giant’s total assets under management were reported to be around $11.5 trillion in October of last year. And according to on-chain data, the President of the United States’ crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is also accumulating Ethereum, with blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reporting that WLFI also purchased over $307 million worth of ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and sent it to Coinbase Prime for management purposes. In a recent strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe told his 768,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit massive new all-time highs if the current bull market extends beyond what many are predicting. The analyst gave a price target of $20,000 for ETH. “I think that there’s a significant chance that this cycle will be longer and go higher than everybody expects. We’ve had the longest bear market on altcoins. Why not have the longest, final bull market on them? Bitcoin to $500,000 and Ethereum to $20,000.

Title: Amazon's earnings are coming. Here's what to expect

Amazon (AMZN+0.84%) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, and expectations are high. Analysts predict strong results for the e-commerce giant, driven by growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, contributions from AI, and a “well-managed” holiday season. Bank of America (BAC+1.37%) is forecasting revenue of $187.24 billion, about $1.53 per share, for the fourth quarter, just shy of Wall Street’s consensus of $187.31 billion in revenue, approximately $1.47 per share.

U.S Prime members saved an estimated $95 billion on free shipping last year, with an average customer saving over $500 in delivery fees.

Amazon (AMZN+0.84%) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, and expectations are high. Analysts predict strong results for the e-commerce giant, driven by growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, contributions from AI, and a “well-managed” holiday season. Bank of America (BAC+1.37%) is forecasting revenue of $187.24 billion, about $1.53 per share, for the fourth quarter, just shy of Wall Street’s consensus of $187.31 billion in revenue, approximately $1.47 per share.

Title: BlackRock to launch new Bitcoin ETP for European market

The fund would be based on Switzerland, and is unlikely to be an IBIT wrapper. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded product (ETP) linked to Bitcoin (BTC) in Europe, Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 5. According to sources familiar with the matter, the fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland, and BlackRock could begin marketing the product as early as this month. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said BlackRock could potentially launch the new ETP in a similar way it did in Canada. The Canadian ETP is a wrapper for IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) available in the US. However, Seyffart noted that such a move would have a low chance of success in Europe. Seyffart highlighted that BlackRock Bitcoin ETPs in the US and Canada have fees of 25 basis points and 32 basis points (bps), respectively. Notably, European products already offer exposure to BTC through funds carrying a 25 bps fee. Eric Balchunas also showed interest in seeing the fees charged by BlackRock in Europe. He explained that the US is commonly the best in the rest of the world in terms of cost and liquidity. Balchunas added: “Either way shows commitment from world’s biggest asset manager who has big presence overseas.” The European market for crypto ETPs includes more than 160 products that track Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The market’s cumulative value is $17.3 billion. Balchunas highlighted that the European crypto ETF landscape is “barely on [the] leaderboard,” as the US spot Bitcoin ETFs represent 91% of the global share. He assessed that BlackRock had a chance to succeed by bringing the “US Terrordome” to Europe. Yet, Balchunas noted that European investors, unlike US and Asian investors, have less appetite for riskier investment products. According to Farside Investors data, IBIT recorded $40.7 billion in net inflows as of Feb. 4. Its inflows are over three times larger than Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of Feb. 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing U.S.-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the U.S. crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out.

Title: Blackrock Plans to Launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe: Bloomberg

The world's largest asset management firm with more than $10 trillion in AUM, Blackrock (BLK) plans on listing a bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) in Europe, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The fund would be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could start marketing it as soon as this month, according to the report. This would be the giant asset manager's first crypto-linked ETP outside of America. Blackrock's U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a wild success, accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets in just more than one year since opening for business. BlackRock's move would be the latest in a string of investment firms looking to dive further into providing crypto-backed securities in Europe. Kraken recently secured a license that will enable it to offer derivatives, joining others like Bitstamp and FTX EU. The company's entry into the European crypto ETP ecosystem could further fuel the competitive response that’s been seen among various providers, which include fee waivers on several products, some expense fees for ETP's have been as high as 2.5%. In the U.S., a similar competitive response came after these funds were launched in Jan. 2024. A lot of question marks still occur around this product, including the fee structure, which would have big implications for the performance of the ETP. “Don't know the fee yet, that will be a big variable," said Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. "U.S. ETFs blow away the rest of the world in cost and liquidity but either way shows commitment from the world's biggest asset manager who has a big presence overseas." U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs currently have 91% of the world market, said Balchunas. Blackrock did not comment before press time. Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

And with a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have never been higher.But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of Häagen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking. “We know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it’s a wide audience,” Jaiven said. The brand’s ad shows stars from the “Fast & Furious” franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. “We thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Häagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Häagen-Dazs in their freezer.”In order to garner more publicity, many advertisers release their ads ahead of the game. Of the ads that have already been released, here’s a sampling of the approaches advertisers are taking during the big game this year.CELEBRITY-PALOOZAHellmann’sHellmann’s ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s “When Harry Met Sally” characters at Katz’s Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann’s.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

Full Content:
February 05, 2025 12:32 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. If you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now » If you’d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more » Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Title: How Trump tariffs could affect weight loss drugs

Time Published: 2025-02-05T16:53:27Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.47%), the maker of the popular GLP-1 medications Wegovy and Ozempic, said potential tariffs on Europe imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could affect its business. The Guardian reports that Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen told reporters during a press conference Wednesday that the company was “not immune” to potential tariffs. Still, he remains confident that the Danish pharma giant is in a “good position to meet the demands of the new [U.S.] administration.” Last week, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which have since been paused for a month. A separate 10% tariff remains in place for Chinese imports. He also said on Sunday that tariffs on the European Union will “definitely happen.” Trump previously threatened to impose “very high” tariffs on Denmark, where Novo Nordisk is headquartered, if it refused to let Greenland become part of the United States. Jørgensen told Bloomberg on Wednesday that Novo Nordisk has a network of factories around the world, including in the U.S., providing it “a hedge against a world with more tariffs.” The comments come on the same day that the company released its fourth-quarter earnings report. Novo Nordisk reported that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%. Other Big Pharma executives have remained relatively quiet on how tariffs could impact their supply chains. Merck (MRK-1.59%) chief financial officer Caroline Litchfield told investors Tuesday during an earnings call that the company expects “a very immaterial impact” from the tariffs. Litchfield said that the company has a manufacturing footprint that “really enables global supply” with low levels of manufacturing in China, Mexico, and Canada. “We will continue to assess the situation based on the different tariffs that are being proposed by the U.S. government, but remain confident in our supply chain and our ability to supply our medicines and vaccines around the world,” Litchfield told investors. While the proposed tariffs didn’t surface during Pfizer (PFE-2.40%) or Amgen’s (AMGN-3.10%) Tuesday earnings calls, several trade groups have voiced concerns about their potential impact. The Health Distribution Alliance and Association for Accessible Medicines warned in a joint statement that these trade measures could disrupt critical supply chains and patient access to medications, particularly generics. “From the base ingredients to the finished products, U.S. medicines rely on a global supply chain that is already stressed and in need of strengthening,” John Murphy III, President and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, said in a statement. “Tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico, and China could increase already problematic drug shortages.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AMD stock plunges 10% despite beating sales expectations

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.13%) tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday morning, hitting a new 52-week low despite the semiconductor giant exceeding revenue expectations in its latest earnings report. The shares were trading at $108 each in the morning. In its fourth-quarter earnings report released Tuesday, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker posted mixed results. Net income was $482 million, down 28% from $667 million a year earlier. Gaming segment revenue dropped significantly, falling 59% year-over-year to $563 million. But revenue came in at $7.66 billion, exceeding the anticipated $7.53 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, slightly surpassing analysts’ expectations of $1.08. AMD projected total sales of $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion for the current quarter, compared to analysts’ average estimate of $7.04 billion. Although AMD lags behind its rival Nvidia (NVDA+2.77%) in selling chips for data centers, its data center unit has become the company’s most crucial business segment. Recent growth has been driven by rising demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence. In the latest quarter, AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, marking a 69% year-over-year increase. “Data Center segment annual revenue nearly doubled as EPYC processor adoption accelerated and we delivered more than $5 billion of AMD Instinct accelerator revenue,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The company, which has been struggling with costs, reduced its global workforce by 4% in November 2024 in an attempt to focus on competing in the AI chip market. In January, AMD introduced new AI PC and gaming processors at the Consumer Electronics Show. The new Ryzen AI Max Series chips are designed for high-performance computing in “thin and light notebooks.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch Bitcoin ETP in Europe as soon as this month after US success

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock is poised to expand its crypto product line with the launch of a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, capitalizing on the runaway success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg, citing sources with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the plans. Projected to be based in Switzerland, the planned fund would be BlackRock’s first crypto ETP in the European market. The world’s leading asset manager, which previously focused on North America, launched the IBIT fund and subsequently introduced its iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. The new ETP may debut as soon as this month, sources said. BlackRock’s IBIT has become one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs since its launch last January, accumulating approximately $58 billion worth of Bitcoin as of February 4. The fund ranks as the 31st largest ETF globally across all categories, including traditional finance products, according to VettaFi. IBIT has led the spot Bitcoin ETF market with a five-day winning streak, attracting nearly $934 million in net inflows since January 30. Yesterday’s inflows alone totaled approximately $249 million, driving most of the spot Bitcoin ETF market’s gains, according to data from Farside Investors. The European crypto ETP market currently features more than 160 products tracking various digital assets, though its size remains smaller than the US market. The expansion comes as Bitcoin has reached new highs this year, amid increased regulatory clarity following the EU’s implementation of new crypto rules. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart initially speculated that BlackRock might consider replicating its Canadian Bitcoin ETF structure in Europe using a “wrapper” approach, where the ETF holds shares of its US-listed IBIT. However, he swiftly confirmed that this strategy is unlikely to be allowed under EU regulations. Sources told him that EU regulators are poised to reject such a workaround, likely requiring BlackRock to launch a standalone European Bitcoin ETF. This necessitates a different approach and puts the spotlight squarely on fees. “I have been informed that this is unlikely to be allowed in EU. So will be interesting to see what they charge assuming they launch a standalone product. In the US the total cost is 25 bps. Canada is 32 bps,” he wrote on X. “There’s already products at 25 bps and lower in Europe including Valour who has a zero expense ratio product.” Beyond regulatory hurdles and pricing pressures, BlackRock faces a more fundamental challenge: market size and investor appetite, Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared in a comment. The US spot Bitcoin ETF market, despite being just a year old, has exploded in popularity, capturing a staggering 91% of global market share. Europe, by contrast, lags considerably. While European investors are sophisticated, they have historically shown less enthusiasm for the high-octane investment products that have resonated with US investors.

Title: Buy This Cheap 6% Dividend As The S&P 500 Overheats
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/05/buy-this-cheap-6-dividend-as-the-sp-500-overheats/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
oil pumpjacks in silhouette at sunset, panoramic frame (XXXL) We are—unequivocally—bullish on the U.S. economy. We’re also big fans of the 6.1% dividend we’re going to discuss below, which trades for less than half its annual sales. That’s pretty much the opposite of the nosebleed 26 times sales (and 0.03% yield—not a typo) over at Nvidia (NVDA), even after last week’s panic over Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek. Fact is, it’s easy to be bullish on the U.S. these days, with the country’s economy leading (and in many cases lapping) those of other countries. The IMF, for example, sees the U.S. economy growing 2.7% in 2025, tops in the G7 and nearly triple the forecast 1% growth in the Eurozone. What’s more, the U.S. accounted for 26% of global GDP in 2024, according to Visual Capitalist. That’s despite the fact that we only account for a little over 4% of the world’s population. The productivity, dynamism and sheer power of the U.S. economy are marvels — and something we should all be proud of. But here’s the thing: The S&P 500’s valuation is overstretched (to say the least). The 2023 and 2024 bull runs have left the S&P 500 trading at a nosebleed 26 times earnings as I write this. The NASDAQ? A ridiculous 33 times. With numbers like that, you could be looking at a “lost decade” if you’re sitting in an index fund like the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Population growth won’t save us, either. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our numbers will grow just 0.6% a year on average from 2024 to 2034. Look out further and that figure drops sharply, to a mere 0.2% annually from 2045 to 2054. And we have tighter immigration policies coming. Not to mention tariffs, which threaten to slow economic growth and throttle up inflation. The point I’m making is that when it comes to stocks, those who sit in an index fund are in for a shock. The winners in the next decade will be those who make timely moves into (and out of) individual stocks. And if you focus on top-quality dividend stocks, you give yourself two extra advantages: Don’t get me wrong. I’m still a big believer in America. But we contrarian income investors always follow the data, and what it’s telling us is clear: Now is the time to diversify a little beyond America’s borders. It’s just the safe thing to do. Plus there are simply more global stocks in the bargain bin after this massive US-market run-up, like the 6.1%-yielder (with a growing payout) we’ll get into momentarily. Here’s another edge we have as U.S. investors: Because the U.S. market is so dynamic, everyone wants to list here. Which means we can buy big international dividend payers on the NYSE. Which brings me to the stock we’re going to delve into today: BP plc (BP), the British energy giant, a holding of my Contrarian Income Report advisory. BP yields 6.1%, trades on the NYSE and even pays dividends in U.S. funds. It’s the same as buying a U.S.-based producer like Exxon Mobil (XOM) but you’re getting a much higher dividend — XOM yields just 3.7%. Back to BP, whose mix we like better than that of XOM today, with its strong base in the US, through its presence in important shale areas, like the Permian and Eagle Ford. That’s complemented by offshore oil fields in places like its Clair oilfield, offshore Scotland and natural gas production facilities, like its LNG operation in Indonesia. BP has been around forever (more than a century), and like the old British Empire, the sun never sets on its 61-country operation. It was the first company to pull oil out of the ground in the Middle East (in 1908) and opened the first refinery in the region (in 1912). BP also deals in wind power, hydrogen and carbon capture; owns thousands of miles of pipelines; has commercial operations, such as convenience and retail fuel stations, Castrol lubricants and EV charging; trades oil, gas, and renewable and non-renewable power; and even has a bioenergy business. In other words, management has smartly positioned BP as a leader in the energy transition and in the fossil fuels that will still play an important role in the global economy for years to come. Which brings us back to that 6.1% dividend. The company cut its payout by 50% in 2020 and shares were chopped in half, as well. That’s the result of the “Dividend Magnet,” which long-time readers will recognize as the tendency for share prices to track dividend hikes (and cuts). Since then, though, the giant has recovered. Sales doubled between 2020 and 2023, and the firm is solidly profitable again. The “payout penance” continues for BP, with four hikes in the books since its infamous cut. This reminds us that CFOs are like carpenters — they measure twice and cut the dividend just once if they can help it. So far, so good. BP’s dividend sits 50% higher than after the cut. That’s still off its peak but trending positively. BP Dividend Magnet The fact that the British oil giant pays out just 36% of its last 12 months of free cash flow (FCF)—well below my 50% “safety limit”—is another indication that management got it right here. Even so, income scars (and memories of them) are slow to heal. BP trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings and 0.45-times trailing sales today. Contrast that with Exxon, which trades for 1.4-times sales and 14-times forward earnings. This sad pup will soon be readopted by income-hungry investors, especially if 10-year Treasury rates continue to keep bouncing off their “5% ceiling,” as I expect. That suggests long rates are high enough to keep inflation trending down—putting lower rates on the table in the future. All of this leaves us in a pretty sweet spot with BP: collecting a growing dividend set to pull the price higher, along with a 6.1% yield. And thanks to the stock’s bargain valuation, we’re getting some nice downside insulation here (always appreciated in the volatile oil business) and a shot at strong upside, too. And it’s all underpinned by the British giant’s exposure to the still-growing U.S. economy and the undervalued global one, too. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Ondo GM will provide exposure to Apple, Tesla, SPDR, and more with stablecoin transactions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance has introduced Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a platform designed to bring real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto the blockchain. According to a Feb. 4 statement, this move provides global access to US securities by enabling investors outside the US to gain exposure through tokenized representations of these assets. It stated: “With Ondo GM, anyone outside the US in eligible geographies can get exposure to thousands of US securities—AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ, etc.—with minimal fees using stablecoins, removing traditional cost and geographic barriers.” The company said that the token issued through Ondo GM maintains a 1:1 backing with its underlying security, ensuring legitimacy and transparency. It noted that these tokens function similarly to stablecoins, facilitating seamless transfers across blockchain networks beyond US borders. Ondo furthered that investors benefit from instant minting and redemption, enhanced liquidity, and built-in access to on-chain financial services, including lending, trading, and yield-generation opportunities. Ondo added: “Ondo GM will propel financial markets into the open economy, returning power to stakeholders to make their own decisions and compete on a level playing field, while addressing challenges like high fees, limited availability, and transfer frictions.” To support broader adoption, Ondo GM provides comprehensive APIs that enable brokers, asset issuers, and fintech platforms to integrate tokenized assets into their systems. Additionally, a legal framework ensures investor protection, safeguarding assets with a structured approach that minimizes risk. Ondo’s move comes as the RWA sector has experienced remarkable growth, reaching an all-time high of $16.88 billion in on-chain value. Data from RWA.xyz reveals a 94% increase over the past year, with nearly $4 billion added in the last three months alone. There are now 83,049 entities holding RWAs, collectively managing assets issued by 112 providers. Private credit leads the market with $11.6 billion in tokenized value, followed by US Treasury debt ($3.5 billion) and commodities ($1.1 billion). Institutional funds represent a smaller portion, valued at around $410 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for RWAs, hosting 67 asset tokens, while zkSync (28) and Arbitrum (20) follow closely. The surge in RWA adoption aligns with growing interest from traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have deepened their involvement in tokenized finance, signaling a shift toward blockchain-powered investment solutions.

Marc Chaikin is a legendary figure on Wall Street, renowned for spotting market trends before they unfold. His insights have accurately predicted major downturns, including the 2012 Priceline collapse, the COVID-19 market crash, and the recent banking crisis. When Chaikin speaks, Wall Street pays attention. This time, he’s sounding the alarm on the AI frenzy sweeping the U.S. stock market. According to Chaikin, investors holding the wrong AI stocks risk devastating financial losses. He stated, “If you’re holding Nvidia (NVDA) or FAANG right now, it’s time to prepare for a massive shift.” However, Chaikin believes there’s still a lot of money to be made in AI stocks, but only the right ones. Unlike before, picking a random trending stock won’t make you a millionaire. The markets are tough, and only accurate stock picking is the key to success. The demand for AI tech and products is growing by the minute. Companies like Palantir Technologies have benefited hugely from this. The stock is up by more than 60% since mid-January. This comes after a huge 340% increase in stock prices in 2024. This surge in prices is backed by a strong 36% year-on-year revenue growth, which now stands at $828M. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO, credits the ‘untamed’ growth of demand in its AI software for the surge. The company now expects to increase revenue by another 54% in 2025. As you can see, picking the right AI stocks is the need of the hour. However, doing so can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Even then, the probability of the stock making you money is less, given the choppy waters in which AI stocks find themselves. This is where AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an autonomous AI agent that cuts through the information overload floating around about the crypto market and produces actionable insights through hive-mind analysis. What this means is that $MIND can interact with influencers and shape conversations and discussions on platforms like X. In the process, it forms a view of its own to produce triggers for all token holders. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this self-evolving AI agent helps investors identify early opportunities in the market by processing information in real time. The problem with crypto investing is that there’s too much information, all of which may or may not be factual. By the time a human can process this information barrage, the opportunity is long gone. $MIND, on the other hand, uses only real-time information (as fresh as a few seconds ago) to form a view of the markets. This adds to your trading efficiency by cutting down on data deviations. MIND of Pepe not only looks to take forward the legendary frog meme legacy but also adds real-time utility for all crypto investors. What would investors love more than regular early-opportunity investment ideas in a dicey AI stock market? Plus, $MIND developers have laid out a long-term vision for the project. Out of a total supply of 100B $MIND tokens, 30% has been reserved for innovation and AI agent updates, while 25% has been kept to support the AI agent ecosystem growth. Early $MIND investors can also earn 443% APY staking rewards – 15% of the token supply has been kept for staking and community incentives. No wonder experts believe $MIND can help investors make crazy gains in this bull run. The $MIND presale is currently live, with the project having already raised $5.1M so far. It’s, in fact, one of the best crypto presales going around right now. Available at a price of just $0.0032662 per token, the next price increase will happen in less than 2 days. This means this is the perfect time to buy the best AI agent coin. Simply visit the official $MIND presale page and connect your wallet. You can buy it with ETH, BNB, or USDT or use your card directly to complete the payment. However, it’s important to remember that crypto markets are subject to volatility and news-based risks. That’s why it is important to do your own research before making any purchases.

Title: Super Bowl ads offer laughs, celebs and surprises to win over viewers

Eugene Levy’s trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars NEW YORK -- Eugene Levy's trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars. A tongue dances to Shania Twain to promote Nestle's Coffee Mate Cold Foam. And Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunite at Katz's Deli in an ad for Hellmann's. A frenzied mix of silliness and celebrities is hitting the airwaves and the internet, and that means one thing: it is Super Bowl ad time again. Veteran advertisers are using tried-and-true tactics like celebrity cameos, humor and cute animals to win over watchers. Meanwhile, first-time and newer advertisers are courting outrageousness and using stunts to try to stand out in the battle to capture the attention of the more than 120 million viewers expected to tune into Sunday's game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on Fox. Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they're as primed to watch the ads as they are the game. "This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. “We may be on different sides, you know, of the gridiron or the field. But we come together.” With 80-plus ad spots divvied up among the 50-something advertisers during the game, it’s tough to make sure viewers remember your brand message. And with a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have never been higher. But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of Häagen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking. “We know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it’s a wide audience,” Jaiven said. The brand's ad shows stars from the “Fast & Furious” franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. “We thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Häagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Häagen-Dazs in their freezer." In order to garner more publicity, many advertisers release their ads ahead of the game. Of the ads that have already been released, here's a sampling of the approaches advertisers are taking during the big game this year. Hellmann's Hellmann's ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's “When Harry Met Sally” characters at Katz's Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann's. Sydney Sweeney joins to utter the famous line “I'll have what she's having.” Meta Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth wear Ray-Ban Meta AI-powered glasses while looking at art. Hemsworth accidently eats a banana in an art piece worth $6.2 million, and Kris Jenner appears to scold them. Michelob Ultra Actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe star as pickleball players hustling younger players to win Michelob Ultras. Stella Artois Soccer star David Beckham learns he has a twin named Dave Beckham who turns out to be Matt Damon. They don't have much in common but both drink Stella Artois. Uber Eats Matthew McConaughey explains a conspiracy theory that football was invented to sell food, with cameos by Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig, Charli XCX, Kevin Bacon and YouTuber Sean Evans. Coors Light Adorable sloths undergo mishaps because they're slow, like a kitchen fire and running into a glass door; they have a “Case of the Mondays,” like many people sluggish at work the day after the Super Bowl. Little Caesars Actor Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and fly around after he tries the pizza chain's Crazy Puffs in what is strangely not the only ad with flying facial hair in it (see Pringles). Nestle Coffee Mate The first-time advertiser goes for silly humor in an ad that shows a man’s tongue dancing, and even doing a flip, to a song sung by Shania Twain to represent how good Nestle Coffee Mate Cold Foam tastes. Pringles Actor Nick Offerman, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and L.A. Clippers’ James Harden watch their famous mustaches fly away to help deliver Pringles. Dove Dove highlights the problem of low body confidence in young girls and depicts a young girl running down the sidewalk to H.E.R.’s version of “Born to Run.” Foundation to Combat Antisemitism Patriot owner Robert Kraft has an ad in the game for the second year in a row. Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady voice reasons why people hate each other in an effort to combat hate speech. Hims and Hers First-time advertiser Telehealth company Hims & Hers highlights the obesity epidemic and says weight loss drugs should be more affordable. Novartis First-time advertiser Novartis is focusing on breast cancer awareness in its ad featuring Wanda Sykes and Hailee Steinfeld. Häagen-Dazs The ice-cream brand reunites “Fast & Furious” stars Michelle Rodriguez, Vin Diesel and Ludacris, except this time, they're going slow. They cruise down the Pacific Coast Highway in a Chevrolet Chevelle slowly so they can enjoy eating an ice cream bar. Instacart First-timer Instacart joins DoorDash and Uber Eats and a battle between food delivery services during the game. Instacart loads up its ad with tons of brand characters it hopes viewers recognize: from Mountain Dew’s “PuppyMonkeyBaby” character from a 2016 Super Bowl ad to the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. The characters represent all the things you can get delivered from the food delivery service. Totinos Pizza Rolls In one of several ads featuring aliens, comedian Tim Robinson and actor Sam Richardson say goodbye to an alien who was living in their neighborhood. Cookware brand Hexclad and Doritos ads also feature aliens. Not all advertisers release their ads early, so there are always plenty of surprises on game day. Only two auto brands, Stellantis' Jeep and Ram, have announced Super Bowl ad plans, but they haven't given any details on the ads. Dunkin' has secured the first ad spot after kickoff but is staying mum on details other than teasing that it will star Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong. Canned water company Liquid Death will advertise for the first time with an ad created in-house. Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a “Duracell Scientist” but hasn't given any other details. Ad experts think it is unlikely that an A.I.-generated ad will debut during advertising's biggest night after Coca-Cola's holiday ad created with the help of A.I. technology drew some backlash. But if one did debut, it would be sure to make a splash. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Google Leads Tech Stock Slump As Earnings, Trump Tariffs Fallout Weighs On Market

A slew of major American technology stocks pulled back Wednesday, as the latest batch of fourth-quarter earnings and an increasingly complicated operating environment for multinational companies ate at Wall Street’s risk appetite. An ever-shifting geopolitical backdrop has weighed on the minds of investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index dipped 0.7% shortly after market open. Leading the losses was an 8% drop for Google parent Alphabet, a slide which erased as much as $211 billion in market value after the company’s earnings report revealed weaker Q4 revenues than consensus analyst forecasts and far higher 2025 spending guidance than anticipated, as Alphabet stock paces toward its biggest percentage loss since October 2023. Also struggling after their company’s earnings reports were shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices and ride-hailer Uber. AMD stock tanked 10% to their cheapest level since 2023 after the firm fell short of estimates in its artificial intelligence-focused datacenter division, while Uber stock fell 7% after the company predicted lower-than-expected ride revenue during 2025’s first three months. Notable fallers not tied to quarterly results included iPhone maker Apple, and Elon Musk’s electric vehicle producer Tesla, both of which suffered about 2% share price declines. Apple’s drop followed a Bloomberg report Chinese regulators are considering an antitrust investigation into Apple over its App Store fees, a possible retaliation to President Donald Trump’s 10% additional tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. Tesla’s dip came after the company reportedly suffered its worst month for new car sales in Germany since 2021 and France since 2022, a potential consequence of Musk’s outspoken support for right-wing politicians including Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland party. The Nasdaq is still up 1% in 2025, but it’s been a rocky path to those gains, as tariffs and the heated U.S.-China generative AI competition weighed on investors’ minds. Also down Wednesday were New York-listed shares of Chinese companies. Online retailers Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo, the two most valuable U.S.-traded Chinese firms, both suffered about 2% drops as investors reacted to an increasingly messy trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which most recently resulted in the U.S. Postal Service briefly pausing acceptance of all packages from China and Hong Kong.

Title: Wall Street Analyst Reaffirms Buy on Meta Platforms (META) With $750 Target, Citing AI & Reels Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top AI stocks trending on Wall Street. The tech world may be steering in a new direction with the emergence of DeepSeek and the cheaper and more efficient models it promises. In the latest news, bulls from Europe have deemed that the sector may have further to run, despite the emergence of these Chinese copies. This news emerged after January 27, when the tech world witnessed a broad market sell-off driven by DeepSeek’s advancements, investors’ concerns regarding West’s huge investments in chipmakers and data centers, valuation risks, and increasing competition from alternative AI models. In short, DeepSeek sparked a rout in the tech world. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks on Analysts’ Radar Right Now With the emergence of these models, companies are readjusting their approaches, focusing more on efficiency rather than demand. Even big AI names such as OpenAI have been prompted to rethink their strategies. The AI startup is reportedly thinking of “figuring out a different open-source strategy” after DeepSeek released a lower-cost open-source AI model, Seeking Alpha reported Saturday. Moreover, OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil recently unveiled that the company was considering open-sourcing older AI models. This reflects a broader industry shift toward efficiency and accessibility. Nevertheless, since the sell-off, tech stocks have thankfully rebounded. European markets in particular are hitting new highs, Reuters reports. One economic theory, known as the “Jevons Paradox” seems to be the answer. According to the paradox, when a resource becomes more efficient to use, demand may increase rather than the other way around. This is because the price of using the resource drops. “I hadn’t discussed it until Monday (last week), and then suddenly it’s everywhere. This paradox highlights one of the uncertainties at the moment,” said Jewell, flagging that a key question for European stock-pickers is whether data centres and their suppliers will be less in demand.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Bloomua / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. On February 4, Meta was revisited by a Wall Street analyst, Sachin Mittal from DBS, who maintained his Buy rating on the stock with a $750 price target. Mittal’s buy rating stems from Meta (NASDAQ:META)’s strong financial performance and strategic initiatives. The company surpassed market expectations in terms of earnings and revenue growth, driven by reduced legal losses and strong performance from its Reels initiative. Reels are a form of short, vertical video format advertising that has achieved growth in monetization and user engagement. They leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to boost content recommendation abilities and targeting capabilities. Besides the robust performance from Reels, the company’s investment in AI technologies, particularly the Llama large-language model, has also demonstrated growth and is anticipated to drive further user engagement and advertising efficiency. Further justifying the buy rating is Meta’s focus on Metaverse and a favorable profit outlook. Overall, META ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks trending on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Ozempic boom is slowing down

Time Published: 2025-02-05T13:45:00Z
Full Content:
Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.47%) blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy doubled in the fourth quarter, but the Danish pharmaceutical giant warns that sales growth for all its drugs — including Ozempic — is expected to slow in the coming year. Wegovy sales skyrocketed 107% to 19.8 billion Danish Krone ($2.8 billion) in the fourth-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.4 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug just beat analysts’ expectations of $2.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.43%). Sales of Ozempic during the quarter rose 7% to $4.7 billion. “We are pleased with the performance in 2024, where 26% sales growth reflects that more than 45 million people are now benefiting from our treatments,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in the company’s fourth quarter earnings report. Novo Nordisk reported that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slowdown to between 16% and 24%. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Overall, the company’s profit rose 23% in the three months ending Dec. 31, reaching $3.9 billion, up from $3.2 billion in the same period the previous year. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 24% year over year to $11.9 billion, from $9.5 billion and surpassing analyst projections of $11 billion. Earnings per share came in at $0.88, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $0.83, according to FactSet. Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+3.43%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Despite strong demand, Novo Nordisk’s stock has fallen 27% over the past year. A recent dip followed the underwhelming results of CagriSema, its experimental weight-loss and diabetes drug. The medication failed to meet expectations of 25% average weight loss, with patients in a phase 3 clinical trial losing an average of 22.7% of body weight over 68 weeks. Still, the company’s stock rose nearly 3% during pre-market trading on Wednesday following the earnings release.

Title: Will DeepSeek Upend US Tech Dominance?

US restrictions on high-tech exports to China were designed to hamper the country's progress in cutting-edge sectors, such as artificial intelligence. But, as DeepSeek has shown, the restrictions have had the opposite effect, spurring precisely the kinds of innovations that will enable Chinese firms to challenge US tech oligopolies. LONDON – In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first artificial satellite into orbit, sparking fears in the United States that, unless it took radical action to accelerate innovation, its Cold War adversary would leave it in the technological dust. Now, the Chinese startup DeepSeek has built an artificial intelligence model that it claims can outperform industry-leading American competitors, at a fraction of the cost, leading some commentators to proclaim that another “Sputnik moment” has arrived. But the focus on the US-China geopolitical rivalry misses the point. Rather than viewing DeepSeek as a stand-in for China, and established industry leaders (such as OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic) as representatives of the US, we should see this as a case of an ingenious startup emerging to challenge oligopolistic incumbents – a dynamic that is typically welcomed in open markets. DeepSeek has proved that software ingenuity can compensate, at least partly, for hardware deficiencies. Its achievement raises an uncomfortable question: Why haven’t leading US industry leaders achieved similar breakthroughs? Nobel laureate economist Daron Acemoglu points the finger at groupthink, which he says prevented Silicon Valley incumbents from adequately considering alternative approaches. He might have a point, but it is only half the story. DeepSeek’s success didn’t happen overnight. In May 2024, the firm launched its V2 model, which boasted an exceptional cost-to-performance ratio and sparked a fierce price war among Chinese AI providers. Moreover, over the last year or so, Chinese firms – both giants (including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance) and startups (like Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, Baichuan AI, MiniMax, and 01.AI) – have all developed cutting-edge AI models with remarkable cost efficiency. Even within the US, researchers have long explored ways to improve the efficiency – and thus lower the costs – of AI training. For example, in 2022, former Meta researcher Tim Dettmers, now at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and his co-authors published research on optimizing AI models to run on less computing power. DeepSeek cited their research in the technical paper it released along with its V3 model. Put simply, it would have been impossible for any AI firm – especially an industry leader – not to realize that lower-cost models were feasible. But American AI developers showed much less interest than their Chinese counterparts in pursuing this line of innovation. This was not a matter only of insularity or hubris; it appears to be a deliberate business choice. Don’t miss our next event, taking place at the AI Action Summit in Paris. Register now, and watch live on February 10 as leading thinkers consider what effective AI governance demands. Register Now AI development has so far been defined by the “scaling law,” which predicts that more computing power leads to more powerful models. This has fueled demand for high-performance semiconductor chips, with more than 80% of the funds raised by many AI companies going toward computing resources. That is why the biggest winner has been the advanced chipmaker Nvidia, which claimed 90% of the market for AI graphics processing units by the end of last year. Thanks to this virtual monopoly in the hardware layer, Nvidia could control the foundations of generative AI. The cloud-computing sector, which provides the on-demand computing power AI models require, is similarly concentrated, with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dominating the market. But these upstream players aren’t just passive suppliers. They have strategically positioned themselves across the AI value chain by acquiring, investing in, or forming alliances with leading AI model developers. Nvidia has invested in OpenAI, Mistral, Perplexity, and others. Google not only develops its own AI models, but also holds a stake in Anthropic, OpenAI’s main competitor. And Microsoft, an early OpenAI investor, recently backed Inflection AI in the US and expanded overseas, with investments in France’s Mistral and the United Arab Emirates’ G42. Taking this approach has ensured that the entire AI industry depends on a few giant firms and entrenched a dynamic whereby rising demand for computing power across the sector increases these firms’ profits. As dominant players, they had less incentive to improve cost efficiency downstream, which could cut into their upstream profits. Chinese AI firms have been operating within an entirely different reality, as US-led trade restrictions have prevented them from purchasing the most advanced chips. The goal of US export controls has always been to cripple China’s AI sector. But, as DeepSeek has shown, they have had the opposite effect, spurring precisely the innovations that will enable Chinese firms to challenge American AI oligopolies. Already, DeepSeek’s rise triggered a stock-market selloff of AI-related US companies, not least Nvidia. This is surely unwelcome news for US President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump has made no secret of his determination to contain China, including by fulfilling his promise to impose a 10% across-the-board import tariff on Chinese goods. And he has heavily courted Silicon Valley bosses – once aligned with the Democratic Party – who have eagerly embraced the prospect of lax regulation. But that does not mean that DeepSeek’s rise is bad news for the US or the AI industry more broadly. Over the past five years, calls to rein in America’s tech giants have been growing louder. Despite the best efforts of former President Joe Biden’s administration, however, the US Congress has failed to introduce any meaningful legislation on this front. Ironically, thanks to US policies designed to constrain China’s AI ambitions, the US AI sector seems set to get some of the market competition that it so badly needs. Geopolitics might have contributed to DeepSeek’s rise. But the firm’s disruption of the AI industry is about market – not great-power – competition.

Title: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge 175% Year-Over-Year
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/05/u-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows-surge-175-year-over-year

U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a 175% year-over-year increase in almost the first three weeks of trading. In 2025, from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5, net inflows equaled $4.4 billion, while the 2024 net inflows for the first three weeks equaled $1.6 billion. The spot bitcoin ETFs were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time, and have accumulated over $40.6 billion in total net inflows. In the same time, BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) has seen a total of $40.7 billion in net inflows. While the total net inflow for all 11 spot BTC ETFs is $40.6 billion, due to Grayscale GBTC witnessing outflows of $21.9 billion. To determine whether these inflows reflect a directional long position or are part of a basis trade—where an investor goes long on the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when they trade at a premium to spot. Currently, investors can capture a premium of approximately 10%, which will eventually diminish as the spot price converges with the futures contract's expiry. According to Glassnode data, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary venue for such trades, has seen a year-to-date decline in open interest from 180,099 BTC to 168,549 BTC, suggesting that these inflows are not primarily driven by basis trading. James Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment. Previously, James worked as a Research Analyst at Saidler & Co., a Swiss hedge fund, where he developed expertise in on-chain analytics. His work focuses on monitoring flows to analyze Bitcoin's role within the broader financial system.

Title: The Smartest Investment: How ‘Quality Jobs’ Drive Profits
URL: https://observer.com/2025/02/why-quality-jobs-drive-profits-and-boost-the-economy/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T12:00:35Z

The American workplace is in crisis. In 2024, Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace Report quantified what everyone already knew: 33 percent of U.S. workers are “engaged,” 51 percent are “not engaged,” and 16 percent are “actively disengaged.” Looking only at those numbers, you’d be forgiven for wondering whether there was some sort of collective, corporate effort to make Americans hate what they do for a living. As Charlie Munger famously said, “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Across centuries, political divides and academic disciplines, one idea remains clear: quality jobs are the foundation of thriving markets, strong economies and healthy societies. Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, emphasized in The Theory of Moral Sentiments that markets require moral foundations. More recently, MIT professor Zeynep Ton reinforced this principle, showing that companies with strong job quality strategies see 30-40 percent lower turnover, 20-30 percent higher productivity and 15 to 25 percent higher customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, in What Happened to Capitalism?, Oren Cass points to a stark reality: over the past 50 years, corporate profits have soared 185 percent, while wages have grown just 1 percent. A “quality job” encompasses several key attributes that collectively enhance the well-being and satisfaction of employees. These positions offer fair compensation, ensuring that workers receive wages commensurate with their skills and experience. Beyond monetary rewards, quality jobs provide comprehensive benefits packages, including health insurance and retirement plans, which contribute to long-term financial security. Such roles also offer opportunities for professional growth through training and development programs, enabling employees to advance their careers. Moreover, quality jobs foster a positive work environment characterized by respect, inclusivity and a healthy work-life balance, ensuring employees feel valued and supported. Collectively, these elements improve individual job satisfaction and enhance overall productivity and organizational commitment. The increasingly stark contrast between profits and wages has led to growing calls for change. In 2019, the Business Roundtable made history when 181 CEOs renounced shareholder primacy and embraced stakeholder capitalism. They committed to investing in employees through fair compensation, benefits, training and workplace dignity. Johnson & Johnson pioneered this stakeholder approach with their 1943 credo, explicitly recognizing responsibilities to employees before shareholders as a precondition to generating sustainable profits. For many, the results speak for themselves: Costco (COST) pays its workers an average of $25 per hour with 13 percent turnover versus the industry’s 60 percent. Southwest Airlines introduced its profit-sharing program in 1974 and boasts a 4 percent employee turnover rate. Nucor Steel maintains a no-layoffs policy through downturns and shares profits directly with workers; in 2023, this translated to almost $1 billion in profit sharing for the company’s nearly 31,000 employees. Others offer cautionary tales. In 2019, McDonald’s announced it would no longer lobby against raising workers’ pay, indicating previous resistance to wage increases. Despite this shift, the company has faced challenges in attracting workers, leading to wage increases in 2021 to address a “challenging hiring environment.” And though Amazon promised better worker treatment, union battles, high injury rates and reports of worker surveillance were just a few of the headlines that made issues for Jeff Bezos last year. Of course, Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald’s remain highly successful, profitable and growing companies. But imagine how much more impactful they could be—both economically and reputationally—if they fully embraced the commitments they made in 2019. Their influence is undeniable; the question is whether they’ll use it to set a new standard or simply maintain the status quo. Investing in quality jobs isn’t just an honorable choice—it’s a financial one. Higher wages, predictable schedules and training programs reduce turnover, cut recruitment costs and boost output. Southwest Airlines, Nucor and Costco aren’t simply doing the right thing; they’re outcompeting their peers because of it. I coined the term “Patriotic Capitalism” to refer to the notion of an economic and investment framework that prioritizes country, democracy and the common good as the way forward for national prosperity. This framework aligns with the vision of an economy where people can contribute productively to their communities, support their families and raise children prepared to do the same. Beyond ethics, it’s essential for national competitiveness in a world where human capital determines success. In addition to policy changes, attitude shifts across C-suites and boards are necessary. Superior operational design and a focus on human capital investment can generate enhanced and sustainable financial returns. Research conducted by a global private equity firm found that companies whose senior management had the highest levels of empathy generated the highest financial returns. Authentic empathy engages workers; engaged workers drive innovation, productivity and profitability. Quality jobs go beyond fair pay—they lay the foundation for innovation and productive investment. The framework is straightforward, comprising common-sense elements like broad-based employee ownership, fair compensation, predictable schedules and meaningful training. The evidence is clear: quality jobs strengthen companies, build resilient communities and enhance national competitiveness. Businesses that embrace this approach aren’t just doing good; they’re gaining a sustainable competitive edge. The choice isn’t between profitability and good jobs—that’s a false dichotomy that both Adam Smith and modern research debunk. Yes, raising wages and offering ownership requires an upfront investment—but high turnover, low morale and worker disengagement already cost U.S. businesses billions annually. Paying employees better isn’t charity; it’s a calculated business strategy that leads to higher productivity, stronger brand loyalty, and better long-term returns. Quality jobs are the smartest investment a company can make in its future. And in today’s global economy, they might be the smartest investment America can make in its future, too.

Posted on February 5, 2025 by Aayush Leave a Comment Every homepage tells a story. Some ramble and lose their audience, while others pull visitors in from the first scroll. The secret isn’t in flashy tricks or following rigid templates — it’s about understanding what makes people click, read, and take action. The best homepages share key design elements that make them work. Let’s explore how to arrange these pieces to create a homepage that captures and keeps attention. Along the way, we’ll show you how Divi makes the whole process smoother. Your homepage arguably is the most important part of your website — it’s your storefront, boardroom, and elevator pitch rolled into one. Think of it as the face of your business that greets every visitor, whether they’re typing in your web address or clicking through search results. Most visitors spend less than 50 milliseconds deciding if they want to stick around. That quick judgment shapes how they view everything else about your business. A well-designed homepage doesn’t just look good — it shows visitors exactly what they need to know and where to go next. But here’s what many website owners miss: your homepage is less about cramming every detail about your business and more about creating clear paths that guide different types of visitors to their goals. When done right, it turns casual browsers into interested leads and helps current customers find what they need fast. Picture stepping into a new coffee shop. Within seconds, you decide whether to stay for a drink or walk right out. Your website’s homepage creates that same gut reaction for every visitor there. Good design speaks volumes about your business. Think about the websites you love visiting. They feel inviting and well-organized, like your favorite local shop. But when homepages are messy or confusing, visitors leave quickly. Here’s the good news: you don’t need to be a design genius to create a great first impression. Focus on your visitors’ needs, guide them clearly, and watch those quick visits become longer stays. What makes some homepages instantly click with visitors while others fall flat? From that first scroll to the last — let’s break down the elements that make the difference. Good website navigation works like a well-planned road trip. Your main menu should point visitors to their destination without any detours. Stick to 5-7 clear menu items — the pages visitors use most. Tuck similar pages into neat dropdown menus that open with one click. The best navigation feels invisible. Each link should lead somewhere helpful, and every path should make sense. An example of a good header design on Wonde.com. Image provided by Anna Meleshina on Dribbble Put your most important pages first, keep the labels clear, and add a search box for quick finds, especially if you have a magazine or an eCommerce website. When navigation works right, visitors spend less time looking and more time doing what matters. Your hero section needs to pack a punch in those crucial first seconds. Skip the generic welcome messages — lead with your strongest pitch instead. A great hero section combines a clear headline that speaks to your visitor’s biggest need, supporting text that backs up your promise, and one solid call-to-action button that stands out. Use real photos of your work or team rather than stock images, and make sure your message matches what your ideal customer wants to hear. The best hero sections look pretty and make visitors want to scroll down for more. A value proposition isn’t just another tagline or slogan — it’s why people should pick you over everyone else. Write it in plain words that your grandmother would understand. Focus on the problem you solve or the life you make better for your customers. The best value propositions take your biggest strength and turn it into a clear promise. Maybe you help small businesses grow faster or make complex tech simple for everyone. Whatever it is, put it front and center where visitors can’t miss it. Back it up with a quick example or a striking number that proves your point. Your call-to-action buttons need to do more than say, “Click Here.” Place them where they make sense in your visitor’s journey — not wherever they fit. Start with one main action you want visitors to take, and make that button stand out with contrast and white space around it. An example of a good CTA by Louis Nguyen on Dribbble Add secondary CTAs as backup options, but keep them visually different from your main goal. The best buttons use action words that tell visitors what happens next: “Start Your Free Trial” works better than “Submit.” Space them naturally through your page, where visitors are ready to take action. People trust what others say about you more than what you say about yourself. Sprinkle proof throughout your homepage that shows visitors they’re in good hands. Mix different types of trust builders — client logos, real testimonials, review scores, case study snippets, and hard numbers that show results. Use real customer photos with their testimonials, keeping them short and specific. Include any awards, certifications, or media mentions that are relevant to your field. Back up your promises with genuine and relevant proof that matters to your visitors. Avoid fake-looking stock photos and generic quotes. A well-thought-out design pulls visitors through your page like a good story. Leave enough breathing room around your content — crowded pages make people click away fast. Stick to your brand colors, but don’t go overboard. Two or three main colors work better than a rainbow. Pick fonts that play well together, ensuring everyone can read them easily on any screen. Add photos and graphics that help tell your story, not just fill space. When visitors scroll your homepage, each section should flow naturally to the next one. The best designs stay out of the way and let your message shine. Even the prettiest homepages can fail if they’re built on shaky ground. Before you start designing, let’s look at the pitfalls that can turn visitors away faster than a broken link. Most homepage layouts fail because they try too hard to impress. Website owners pack their pages like sardines — stuffing headlines, images, and buttons into every pixel of space. Take a look at the top websites in your field. Notice how they use empty space? That’s not an accident. Your homepage needs room to breathe. Think of brands like Apple — they pick one strong message and let it stand out. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ When you try to make everything important, nothing is. Start by removing half of what you think you need, then half again. What’s left is usually what matters most to your visitors. Your homepage should maintain a consistent style. Avoid using different fonts in various sections, changing button styles partway through, or choosing colors that clash with your logo. These small errors quickly accumulate. Your brand needs to feel solid from top to bottom. Pick your core design elements and stick with them. That means keeping your headings consistent, using the same button styles throughout, and maintaining your color scheme across every section. When your branding stays steady, visitors trust you more. They might not notice why, but they’ll feel it. Many homepages dance around what they offer — using fancy words that sound good but say nothing. “We leverage innovative solutions” or “transforming digital experiences” might look impressive, but your visitors will bounce faster than a rubber ball. Your value proposition needs to hit hard and fast. Tell people exactly what you do and who you help. “We help small businesses double their sales in 90 days” beats corporate jargon every time. Skip the buzzwords and focus on results. Your visitors should understand what you offer before they reach for their scroll wheel. Phone screens now rule web traffic, yet some homepages still consider mobile users an afterthought. Watch how people browse on their phones — they’re walking, multitasking, or catching up during quick breaks. Your homepage needs to work just as smoothly on a phone as on a laptop. That means readable text without zooming, buttons big enough for thumbs, and menus that make sense on smaller screens. Skip those wide tables and sprawling images that force visitors to scroll sideways. When mobile design clicks, your traffic stats show it — bounce rates drop, and engagement jumps. Three seconds — that’s all you get before visitors start leaving. Bulky images, heavy animations, and too many plugins turn your snappy homepage into a slow crawler. Those fancy video backgrounds and image sliders might look cool in the design phase, but they’re often real-life conversion killers. Load speed matters more than ever, especially on mobile networks. Keep your image sizes in check, cut back on unnecessary scripts, and test your homepage speed regularly. Your visitors won’t wait around while that perfect hero image loads — they’ll just hit the back button and try your competitor instead. Stock photos of people in suits shaking hands or staring at laptops — these clichés make your homepage blend in with thousands of others. Your visitors can spot cookie-cutter images from a mile away. Those perfect office shots and staged team meetings don’t tell your story — they just fill space. Real photos of your actual team, workspace, or products build more trust than the best stock photo money can buy. Even simple product shots on a clean background beat those glossy but fake alternatives. Some homepages scatter CTAs like confetti, hoping visitors will click something — anything. Others bury their most important actions under layers of content. Every button on your page competes for attention, and when everything shouts “click me,” nothing stands out. Your homepage needs a clear action hierarchy. Pick one main goal, make that button stand out, and let supporting CTAs take a back seat. Think of your buttons like a conversation — each one should make sense at that point in the page. Web design has come a long way from when you had to pick between learning code or using basic templates. You can now bring your homepage ideas to life exactly as you picture them, and Divi makes this process feel like playing with building blocks. You can create the perfect website homepage by pointing, clicking, and dragging elements around until they’re exactly where you want them. There are no hidden menus or complicated settings to dig through — everything you need sits right on your screen. While other design tools might give you a handful of options, Divi opens up a whole toolbox. You get over 200 ready-to-use modules, plus all the core design features you’d expect. This means you can build any homepage layout you can think of. Whether you’re building your first homepage or your hundredth, you’ll find everything to make it stand out. Starting from scratch can freeze your creativity instead of sparking it. That’s why Divi gives you over 2,000 ready-to-use designs. The Theme Builder allows you to design templates for various parts of your site. You can create custom headers and footers, layouts for product pages, blog templates, category archives, and even 404 pages. Decide what goes where, and Divi will make it happen for you. Try Out Divi Isn’t starting from scratch frustrating? You know the drill — switching between tools for writing, searching for photos, and hunting down design ideas. Divi AI changes all that. Want to write homepage content that connects with visitors? Tell it about your business, and it’ll help you write headlines and product descriptions that sound natural. No cookie-cutter text here — your homepage will speak in your voice, whether you’re a fun startup or a seasoned pro. ﻿﻿﻿﻿ Maybe your team shots need a boost, or you’re stuck with boring stock images. Pop them into Divi AI and tell it what you’re after. Before you know it, you’ll have photos that look sharp and fit your brand. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Adding new sections to your homepage is just as easy. Need a spot for customers to reach you? Or a place to show off your best work? Tell Divi AI what you want, and it’ll create it to match your site’s look without you having to fiddle with settings. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Now, you can spend less time wrestling with tools and more time growing your business. Simple as that. Upgrade Your Workflow With Divi AI WordPress and Divi work together like peanut butter and jelly. While Divi makes your site look great, WordPress opens up a world of possibilities with thousands of plugins at your fingertips. Want your site to show up higher in Google? Add an SEO plugin. Ready to sell memberships? There’s a plugin for that too. Whatever you dream up for your site, there’s probably a way to make it happen. The best part? Everything just works. Unlike other website builders that start to slow down when you add new features, Divi plays nice with over 75 different tools right out of the box. Stack on as many plugins as you need — your site will keep running smoothly. Got questions? You’re never alone. Jump into the Divi Facebook community, where over 76,000 users share tips and show off their latest designs. Need something special? The Divi Marketplace is packed with extras made just for Divi sites — from ready-to-use designs to powerful add-ons created by folks who know Divi inside and out. Become A Divi Member Let’s discuss designing promising homepages. We’ll walk you through the process using Divi, but don’t worry if you’re using something else — these tips will help you create better home pages no matter what builder you choose. Starting from scratch is probably the easiest way to proceed. Add a new page, open the Divi Builder, and hit “Build From Scratch” to get a fresh start. Let’s talk about that first impression. Your homepage needs a strong opener — we call this the hero section. Grab a full-width header, drop in your best one-liner, and stick a button underneath that tells people exactly what to do next. Nothing fancy, just clear and direct. Most folks want to know they can trust you. Toss in some logos of companies you’ve worked with, or better yet, let your happy clients do the talking with a simple testimonial slider. Keep your main services simple. Those little blurb modules with icons work like a charm line up three or four to show what you’re about. Need to say more? The toggle module lets people click to read extra details without cluttering your page. Divi comes packed with over 200 modules, but don’t go crazy. Pick what you need, add some breathing room between sections, and always check how it looks on your phone. Trust us — mobile views can be tricky. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Last up, make it easy for people to reach you. A simple contact form or a “let’s talk” button at the bottom does the job nicely. Divi’s design library makes finding the perfect page layout a breeze. The builder puts hundreds of ready-to-use designs right at your fingertips. Quick filters and a handy search bar help you spot exactly what you need without endless scrolling through pages of options. The layouts cover every industry imaginable. Restaurant owners can browse through food and drink designs packed with menu sections. Business websites get professional layouts with team galleries. Artists and designers will find portfolio layouts that put their work center stage. Behind the scenes, Divi’s library holds over 300 complete website packs and more than 2,000 individual layouts. Each one comes from our expert design team, who understand what makes a website work. We’ve handled all the technical details — testing every layout across phones, tablets, and computers to ensure your site looks perfect everywhere. Simply pick your favorite design and start customizing it to match your vision. The Divi Marketplace offers you a variety of professional themes and extensions that inspire fresh ideas.

Once your site is live, you can jump in and make tweaks just like any other Divi site. Remember the days when building a website meant weeks of work? Not anymore. With Divi Quick Sites and Divi AI, you can have your homepage up and running before lunch. Just pop over to your Divi dashboard and click “Generate a New Site.” Then, select Generate your Site with AI option and tell it what your business is about in detail. The more the details, the better. Remember, you would need a Divi AI subscription for this path. For example: Site Name: Charlie’s Fit Factory Site Slogan: Building Strength, One Rep at a Time Then, in the Tell Divi AI About Your Website field: Charlie’s Fit Factory is a vibrant gym located in Atherton, known for its welcoming atmosphere and state-of-the-art facilities. The gym offers a wide range of fitness classes, personal training sessions, and modern workout equipment to cater to all fitness levels.

What We Offer: Comprehensive fitness programs, state-of-the-art equipment, certified personal trainers, group classes, and nutrition counseling. Call-to-Action: Sign up for a Free Trial Class. Do you have products to sell? Select the install WooCommerce option, and it’ll also set up your store pages. Next up, images. You may select the Divi Quick Sites option to create something perfect from Unsplash’s huge collection or let Divi whip up custom images. If you have images already, you can also select the “use placeholder” option. Next, you can play with colors and fonts. Pick your own if you know what you want, or let Divi suggest some winning combinations. When you’re happy with how it looks, hit “Generate & Publish” and watch the magic happen. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ A few minutes later, you’ll see your homepage spring to life. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Maybe you run a cozy coffee shop downtown or launch the next big tech startup — whatever your story, Divi Quick Sites gets it right. Your coffee shop won’t sound like a corporate robot, and your startup won’t read like a casual blog. Something not quite right? No problem. Use the visual builder to tweak until everything is where you want it. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Think of it as having a professional web designer in your pocket — one who works at lightning speed but still lets you call the shots. Moreover, if you want to design additional sections with AI, click the add new section button (blue +) and select generate section with AI. Describe and watch as Divi AI puts a section together for you. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ A beautiful design catches the eye, but smart optimization keeps it glued. Here’s how to turn your homepage into a conversion powerhouse that both search engines and visitors will love. Your homepage needs to speak two languages — one for visitors and one for search engines. While visitors scan your content, Google crawls it to understand what you offer. Good SEO helps you show up when people search for businesses like yours. Keyword research tools like SEMrush help you find the exact words your audience types into Google. Once you know these keywords, Divi AI can help weave them naturally into your content. Want to check if your page hits all the right SEO marks? RankMath plugs right into Divi’s visual builder — it’s like having an SEO expert look over your shoulder while you work. This WordPress plugin shows you exactly what to fix as you build your page. Moreover, try these proven homepage SEO tips: A fast homepage keeps visitors happy and Google smiling. Divi’s visual builder does the heavy lifting behind the scenes — it creates clean code while you design and loads only what each page needs. The builder’s Dynamic Module Framework and Critical CSS features mean your homepage loads lightning-fast right from the start. Want to push your speed even further? Pair Divi with WP Rocket to cache your content and EWWW Image Optimizer to shrink those large photos without losing quality. Top it off with SiteGround hosting’s built-in speed tools, and you have a homepage that loads in a snap. Remember — every second counts. A one-second delay can cost you 7% of your conversions. Quick speed boosters: Ever wonder why some websites seem to know exactly what makes people click? They’re probably using split testing — showing two different versions of their homepage to different visitors and seeing which one works better. It’s like having two ice cream flavors and letting customers tell you which one they prefer by what they buy, not just what they say they like. Divi makes these experiments simple with its built-in tool called Divi Leads. Want to test if a video background beats a static image? Or if “Start Free Trial” works better than “Try Now”? Just create both versions in the visual builder, and Divi shows each one to half your visitors. It tracks everything — clicks, signups, sales — and tells you which version wins. No guessing, just clear data about what your visitors prefer. Split testing shows you what works, but analytics tells you why. By watching visitors move through your homepage, you’ll spot patterns you’d never notice otherwise. Maybe people scroll right past your best features, or they get stuck halfway down the page — these insights help you fix what’s broken. Tools like Hotjar show how visitors interact with your homepage through heatmaps and session recordings. You’ll see where they click, how far they scroll, and even watch recordings of actual visits. Pair that with MonsterInsights, which brings Google Analytics into your WordPress dashboard, and you’ll get the whole picture. These tools turn complicated data into clear actions — like determining whether your mobile menu needs work or if your call-to-action button is in the wrong spot. These minor fixes, guided by real data, can turn your good homepage into a great one. Building the perfect homepage is less than following a formula and more about creating an experience that speaks to your visitors and drives results. Throughout this guide, we’ve explored the essential elements, common pitfalls, and proven strategies that make homepages work. The real magic happens when you combine the right tools with your vision. Looking for a head start? Our marketplace offers specialized themes designed for almost every industry and style: But great design needs a solid foundation.

Title: 3 Pairs of Great Transition Pants

Sheaffer Told Me To fashion influencer blog February 5, 2025 By Sheaffer 2 Comments This post is sponsored by Nordstrom and Collective Voice. The product selections are my own, and I only highlight and promote items that I truly love. Thank you for supporting the brands that support Sheaffer Told Me To! ***************** It’s February, which means before we know it, we will be transitioning to spring. Heck, if you live where I live, we basically transitioned to summer this past Monday because we got up to almost 80 degrees. But no worries, today is in the 50s and we’ll be back to winter and temps in the 20s by next weekend, which means I’m already in transitional dressing mode. Haha! I hear from y’all all the time that transitional dressing often stumps people, but I always follow some simple tips and tricks that help me easily transition between seasons. We’ll be talking about them over the next several weeks, but today we’re focusing on pants that really lend themselves to transitional dressing. Tell me this isn’t a perfect outfit to help you transition to warmer temps. (FYI, I was actually hot in this outfit when we were taking pics on Monday.) white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers One of my main tips to transition to another season is a no brainer: to dress in layers. Every single outfit in today’s post starts with this classic white tee that is the perfect base layer. If you’ve been with me for a while, you know I used to wear the “whisper thin” Madewell v-neck tee all the time. It was a good tee at a good price point, but it wasn’t the best quality because it was pretty thin. This white tee is my new favorite white tee. It’s made of a 100% cotton jersey, the fit is perfect, and it’s not see-through at all. Heads up that is does run small. I’m in a medium, and the fit is actually great for a base layering piece, but I would probably want it a bit looser if I was wearing it on its own. And speaking of layers, a great denim jacket is THE #1 CLOSET STAPLE that I feel every single person needs in their closet. I think Kut from the Kloth makes the greatest denim jackets, and you can click HERE to find the one with the wash and fit that you prefer. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers sunglasses / earrings / heart charm necklace heart charm necklace layered coil bracelet / textured bangle I found these ecru jeans last year, but they sold out immediately. They restocked, and then they sold out again. BUT RIGHT NOW THEY APPEAR TO BE FULLY STOCKED and they are a perfect transitional pair of pants. This particular pair is a perfectly neutral “ecru”, but they come in 3 other color options as well. They are ankle cropped flares with a frayed hem, and I love them so much. They do have the Ab Solution power mesh panels that we all appreciate, and they enable the jeans to be super flattering and super comfy at the same time. I’m wearing my regular size 4. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers Y’all. These sneakers. Talk about a breath of fresh air! I’m wearing the “Clear Pink/ Solar Orange/ Gum”, but there’s actually 14 fantastic color combos to choose from! They are incredibly comfy, but I definitely recommend sizing down at least 1/2 a size. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers Dang they’re cute. Adidas sneakers Adidas sneakers Here I’ve switched up the top layer from a denim jacket to a cardigan. And I switched out sneakers for mules. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules This striped cardigan comes in 3 colors and got marked down just yesterday! It’s 100% cotton and a heavier weight than most of the other cardigans in my closet. I’m often drawn to olive green, and y’all know I loved the stripes. For size reference, I’m wearing a small. The cross body is a new favorite find. It’s on the expensive side, but it’s definitely a quality handbag and I think many of y’all are going to think that it is well worth it. The neutral basket weave pattern will go with pretty much any outfit you can dream up, and it comes with a removable shoulder strap as well as a removable cross body strap. There are two interior pockets that make it easy to store your phone or keys…AND GET THIS… you can throw the bag in the wash. No kidding. I’m carrying the “knot brown”, but there’s also a darker option called “Hazelnut”. You can check out all of the bag options from Rothy’s HERE. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules And these earrings? Come on! They’re darling. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / striped cardigan / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag These Rothy’s mules are something special. I really wanted this neutral pair, but they also come in black and an animal print. If I’m being honest, I wish owning all 3 pair made sense because I know I would wear the heck out of all of them. True to size, super super comfy, and they don’t flop when you walk! ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules They are beautifully made, and I absolutely love the design detail. ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** Before we talk about these pants, I’m sad to report that y’all sold them out on Monday. 🙁 I’d already shot these pics and had the idea for the post, so I’m still highlighting the pants…. but I’m doing so with the knowledge that my contact says they are slated to come back in stock at some point, they just don’t know when. When they do come back, GRAB THEM. You pull these babies on like you would a pair of your favorite leggings. But I’m telling you, they’re more comfortable than leggings, because they don’t have the compression that most leggings have. The waistband is wide, it lays nicely, and it is of course uber comfy. And get excited, because as you can see, there are functional pockets. When compared to the other black Wit and Wisdom pants I’ve highlighted in the past, these are a lighter weight than all of them. They have a slimmer leg than the drawstring pants, but the leg is a bit fuller and longer than the more classic trousers I’ve highlighted. For size reference, I’m wearing a small. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers I think this is the way I’ll wear them the most. With a casual tee and a denim jacket. This is an outfit formula that ALWAYS works. This look would also be great with a leopard tote and neutral mules…. or a black bag and white sneakers… the possibilities are endless. If you love the look and want to recreate it, you can click HERE for a similar pair of pants that I also own and love. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers And surprise surprise… a great white tee and a great denim jacket completing another outfit. 😉 white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers sunglasses / earrings / puffy heart necklace / multicolor bead necklace How fun is this necklace combo? This puffy heart is VERY oversized, and I love it. My exact beaded necklace is low in stock, but you can click HERE for a similar option from the same maker if the exact one is no longer available. white tee / puffy heart necklace / multicolor bead necklace These pants are so SO good. Truly, these pants are what black pant dreams are made of. They are a wider leg (but not too wide), which makes them modern but still flattering and not overwhelming. I’m 5’4″ with long legs for my height, and although I think a non-heeled shoe is probably the best choice for these on me, you can click HERE to see Monday’s post where I do have a pic of me wearing them with low black pumps. Again, you can click HERE for a similar pair. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers Here’s a good up-close look at the pants. layered coil bracelet / textured bangle / white tee / denim jacket options / black pants I’m so pumped that I grabbed these leopard sneakers, and I’m so excited to add some sass and comfort to lots of different outfits. They are the perfect pop of leopard to add if you ask me! True to size and quite comfy. Like really REALLY comfy. black pants / leopard sneakers I’m in love with this entire outfit. white tee / denim jacket options / earrings / leopard sneakers Here I’ve got the same pair of pants, but I’ve again switched out the denim jacket for a cardi and the sneakers for mules. white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules This cardigan is another NEW MARKDOWN (as of just yesterday). I feel like it’s a totally classic piece that would serve anybody well. Pair it with black pants for the office, or pair it with jeans and sneakers for a great casual (but totally put together) outfit. This one has a really pretty cable knit pattern and a bit of an unexpected collar. I’m wearing a medium here, but I think I would actually prefer the fit of the small. It does have a tiny bit of wool in it, but it’s not scratchy at all! It’s just soft and warm. Also, I’m in love with the leopard tote from Rothy’s, but I’m so sad to report it’s not currently available at Nordstrom. Because of this, I’m not going to gush about it, but if it comes back in stock (fingers crossed), I totally will. You can click HERE for other leopard bag options if you just can’t wait. white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules cream cardigan / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** Pants don’t always have to be serious. These army green flared ankle jeans aren’t serious, but they sure are unique and adorable. 😉 They’re also stretchy, comfy, and flattering. WIN! WIN! WIN! They come in stone, maple, moss, teal, strawberry, and petal… so there’s definitely something for everybody. I’m wearing my regular size 4. white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers And looky here, I’m wearing my white tee and denim jacket with these too. I’m telling you, if you don’t have a white tee and a denim jacket that you love, you need to fix that now. white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag L.O.V.E. denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers And here’s the same outfit, but with the leopard tote and neutral mules… white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** So what do you think? Can you see yourself in any of these pants? What about the white tee? And how fun are the bags and shoes? I hope you were able to draw some inspiration today for some outfits.

Title: Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip: Morning Brief

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Two market shocks less than three weeks into Trump's second presidential term have revived a playbook familiar to tech investors: "Buy the dip" is alive and kicking. Tariff fears sparked the latest rout Sunday evening, sending small-cap stock futures down 4% overnight — only to recover nearly all the losses by Tuesday close. Only a week before, "fears" of cheap AI from the likes of Chinese up-and-comer DeepSeek sent chip stocks crashing, led by AI poster child Nvidia (NVDA). On both occasions, investors not only bought the dip, but many bought it in the most aggressive way possible: with leverage. On Monday, Jan. 27, Nvidia suffered a 17% decline — its worst since the depths of the early pandemic in 2020. Yet, ETF strategist Todd Sohn, CMT of Strategas ETF Research, recently wrote in a note to clients that the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA ETF (NVDL) pulled in $1.6 billion singlehandedly last week. That product seeks to deliver twice the daily returns of the underlying Nvidia stock, which means that last Monday's 17% NVDA loss was inflated to 34% in the leveraged product. "It's a reflection that the 'buy the dip' mentality still exists for Tech," said Sohn. According to Vanda Research, during the height of the Nvidia washout, retail traders were funneling cash into the market at the highest rate since the November election period. "Mom-and-pop traders poured roughly [$4.25 billion] of new capital into US financial markets," said Vanda, measuring both ETF and single-stock flows over two market days. This "buy the dip" mentality isn't new, but it's become nearly reflexive. Years of easy money and rapid rebounds during the quantitative easing-driven years of global financial crisis recovery up through the COVID rebound conditioned a generation of traders. This mentality has a good chance of being tested again soon. (And maybe again, and again.) So far this year, markets have been sensitive to event risk, as the DeepSeek and tariff developments have shown. And with an active president in the first year of his term, stocks are already navigating a seasonally choppy stretch — one that tends to invite volatility even in calmer times. Factor in the sheer number of market-moving headlines, and even the most bullish strategists acknowledge turbulence ahead. As Tuesday's close underscored, this market may be sensitive, but the dip-buying optimism is unbowed.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Despite China’s DeepSeek model disrupting the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the underlying hardware king. Therefore, the red ink imposed on NVDA stock would appear to be a discounted opportunity — an opinion shared by top analysts and investors. So, the argument isn’t about whether NVDA is an exciting bullish opportunity. Rather, the question is how best to capitalize on NVDA. Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio On a fundamental level, questions exist about the supposed ultra-low-cost nature of the DeepSeek algorithm. Further, the idea that China is about to launch an AI paradigm shift could be misleading. Major enterprises like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) are supply-constrained regarding their AI hardware needs. According to reports, they want to significantly expand their capital expenditures to boost their machine-intelligence capabilities. The average price target of Wall Street analysts is $180 per share, which suggests around 54% upside to come. However, bullish investors can harness a particular options strategy to replicate big payouts over weeks, not years. I’m bullish on a rebound in NVDA stock and continue to believe it will deliver strong returns for shareholders. However, there is a cleaner way of gaining exposure to the tech/AI theme and NVDA stock while generating even more substantial returns than traditional stock investing. The first order of business is to recognize the short-term nature of options trading. Unlike the underlying security, options are classified as “wasting assets” because they all eventually expire worthless. Therefore, if you wager on so-called cheap options — or options far out the money — you effectively engage in binary transactions: you are either winning or losing. Moreover, the progression of time exponentially reduces the option’s premium value as it nears expiration, which tends to mean options traders think short-term. Therefore, focusing on optionable securities like NVDA isn’t about broader fundamentals but pricing behaviors based on statistical trends. Primarily, the key element that makes NVDA stock attractive to options traders is its upward bias. Statistically, when considering data over the trailing five years, traders who enter a position at the beginning of the week have a 56.98% chance of being profitable by the end of it. Over four weeks, the long odds improve to just over 66%. In other words, outside of a truly compelling reason to be contrarian, the numbers favor taking a shot on NVDA stock. However, the market operates with human emotions, and responses can vary depending on fluctuations in the fear-greed continuum. Last week, NVDA stock incurred a loss of 3.79%. Whenever NVDA loses up to 5% of value over one week, there’s a 67.53% chance that the equity will have landed in positive territory by the end of the fourth subsequent week. Stated differently, there’s evidence that investors tend to buy the dip during sizable declines (for the record, negative weeks over the past five years in NVDA carry a median loss of 3.7%). This framework provides all the more evidence that speculators are justified in wanting to buy Nvidia at a discount. Viewing Nvidia stock pricing data in no other context aside from the temporal — NVDA may reach $134.36 over the next four weeks, assuming the positive scenario materializes. If the negative scenario occurs, there is a statistical risk that NVDA could fall to $111.79, according to the options chain expiring Feb. 28. From a dynamic perspective, NVDA is on pace to hit $133.70 per share in an optimistic scenario or fall to $111.79 in an adverse scenario. With this market intelligence, investors can execute a bullish options strategy called the bull call spread. Under a bull spread, the trader buys a call option and simultaneously sells a call at a higher strike price (for the same expiration date). The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call. To be sure, the sale of the short call necessarily caps the reward at the representative strike price. However, the benefit is that the net cash outlay to enter the bullish position is discounted. Further, this discounting lowers the threshold to breakeven, improving the speculator’s odds of success compared to a call-only acquisition. Now, the beauty of the bull spread comes in the form of the reward. If NVDA stock reaches $134, that’s a decent 11.6% return. However, if you only wager a thousand dollars on NVDA, the nominal reward would be $116. In contrast, the bull spread can offer far better rewards, depending on the specific transaction. One of the reasons why investors tend to shy away from multi-leg options strategies like the bull call spread is due to the plethora of available spreads. How does one know which spread to pick? Let me tell you a little secret: it’s just like soccer. In the beautiful game, you improve your scoring chances by committing more players to the attack. At the same time, you leave yourself vulnerable to a counterattack. If you’re worried about conceding a goal, you can take speculative long shots without committing too many players to the attack, although the chances of success are low. In the options arena, the 111/134 bull call spread (buy the $111 call, sell the $134 call) for the options chain expiring Feb. 28 would be an example of a high-commitment attack. As of Monday’s close, the net debit required stood at $895 for the chance to earn $1,405 (a payout of 156.98%). So long as NVDA stock doesn’t drop below $111 by Feb. 28, traders may be able to salvage some intrinsic value out of the long call. However, if Nvidia implodes (i.e., the market’s devastating counterattack), the trader will lose the entire net debit paid to enter the trade. On the other hand, you can select the 132/134 bull spread. This trade only requires a $60 cash outlay for the chance to earn $140, or a payout of 233.33%. However, NVDA stock must reach $134 just to break even. Since both the long and short calls are well out of the money, there’s a strong chance you will lose the entire net debit paid. Still, it may be worthwhile to take that potshot because NVDA stock has such a strong upward bias. Turning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA price target is $179.81 per share, implying a 54.13% upside potential. Currently, NVDA may just be the most Buy-rated stock in the U.S. NVDA stock took a hit last week due to concerns over China’s DeepSeek AI model, but the selloff could be an opportunity in disguise. Despite the noise, NVDA remains the dominant tech hardware player, and history suggests investors tend to buy the dip. The numbers support a bullish outlook, with statistical trends pointing to a likely rebound in the coming weeks. Rather than simply following Wall St guidance and buying stock outright, options traders can take advantage of NVDA’s upside potential through a bull call spread. This approach leverages the stock’s upward bias while limiting risk. Depending on the chosen strike prices, traders can position themselves for a substantial payout if NVDA trades higher. Ultimately, it’s about structuring the trade like a calculated offensive play—balancing risk and reward based on market probabilities. Disclosure. Sign in to access your portfolio

Valerie Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented: "2024 was a year of record financial performance, underpinned by our increasingly diversified business model and driven by strong business income and sustained interest income. Our strategy and new management structure puts clients at the centre of our plans, and we continue to make progress against our key objectives. In 2024, we grew our funds business and European presence through the announced acquisition of Inversis in Spain. We also continue to support market adoption of digital assets by attracting new issuances on our D-SI platform while participating in important projects with industry partners to drive innovation across European post-trade. Our core activities continue to thrive. We have reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities, with assets under custody closing the year over the €40 trillion mark. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway is now close to €2 trillion, while the funds depot also hit a new high of 3.6 trillion." Business performance The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period. FY 2023 FY 2024 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €37.7 trillion €40.7 trillion +8 % +3 % Number of transactions 299 million 331 million +10 % +4 % Turnover €1,072 trillion €1,162 trillion +8 % +5 % Fund assets under custody €3.1 trillion €3.6 trillion +16 % +4 % Collateral Highway €1.67 trillion €1.9 trillion +15 % +1 % Underlying cash deposits (full year average) €23.7 billion €22.8 billion -4 % +3 % Euroclear's assets under custody reached a record €40.7 trillion, growing for the ninth quarter in a row, thanks to solid stock exchange performances and robust results in fixed income. Settlement volumes hit a new high due to sustained activity throughout the year. Boosted by the ETF activity, combined with the rise in equity markets, fund assets under custody reached the record level of €3.6 trillion. The Collateral Highway's outstanding continues to increase and is now close to its prior peak level. Business milestones Advancing the funds business Over the past years, Euroclear's funds offering has evolved rapidly thanks to acquisitions such as MFEX in 2021 and Goji in 2023. In 2024, major clients in Asia, Europe and the US, including Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess), Blackrock, China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS Bank or ODDO BHF have selected Euroclear FundsPlace for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides them with a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing their clients to have access to more than 250,000 funds. In 2024, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in IZNES, a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology. This partnership complements Euroclear's funds services in the French market and beyond as it continues to play an active role in the development of innovative funds distribution models. In July 2024, Euroclear announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis, a leading provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services with the intention to become the full owner of the Spanish company by end 2027. By acquiring Inversis, Euroclear aims to accelerate the delivery of its funds strategy and increase its pan-European coverage thanks to Inversis' significant presence on the Spanish market. In Asia, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode, a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode, Euroclear aims to participate in the setup of a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using DLT technology. Reshaping traditional financial services Euroclear has an important role to play in bridging the gap between digital asset securities and the conventional financial landscape. In 2024, Euroclear made significant progress to become a digital, data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first of such digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. Euroclear is also actively engaged in exploring the full potential of digital assets and participates in various DLT projects with market partners. Alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council, it successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold, Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. With the support of Paris Europlace, Euroclear worked with a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to issue the first Digitally Native Note (DNN) under French law and settled it in CBDC. Streamlined management structure Following the appointment of Valérie Urbain as CEO of the group, Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team to accelerate strategy execution. A new, expanded Executive Committee composed of eight members ensures the representation of all the group's constituents in all key strategic decisions and a stronger focus on clients, business operations and people – both in Europe and internationally. Launch of the Euroclear Foundation to amplify social impact Euroclear aims to make a significant positive social impact in the locations where it operates. By establishing the Euroclear Foundation, Euroclear will seek to improve lives and support the next generation by working to eliminate pressing social and environmental issues. The Euroclear Foundation builds on the company's existing initiatives aimed at increasing its social impact. These include a group-wide volunteering programme, long-term community partnerships and a Matching Gift programme to match employee donations. Russian sanctions impacts Financial impacts of the Russian assets Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business. As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of December 2024, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €212 billion, of which €183 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets. In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In 2024, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €6.9 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings generated €1.7 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment. Effective 15 February 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs, such as Euroclear Bank, should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities, should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders). In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements, Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. A second payment is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion. Issued on 16 December 2024, the 15th EU sanctions package against Russia included a loss recovery mechanism which allows for the release of cash balances held by European CSDs under certain conditions. This derogation will enable CSDs to request competent authorities to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients. Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations. As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities. The full year 2024 summary income statements and financial positions for both entities are shown below. The drop in FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the booking of the windfall contribution related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024. The evolution of FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the increase in intragroup dividend. Euroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :Advanced Micro Devices shares tumbled 8 per cent on Wednesday after the company's AI chip revenue failed to meet analysts' high expectations, underscoring its struggle to grab market share from well-entrenched market leader Nvidia. The company's fourth-quarter data center revenue, which reflects demand for its AI processors, jumped 69 per cent to $3.9 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $4.15 billion. "AMD may still be taking market share from Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) side of things, but it remains a long way behind Nvidia and is struggling to catch up when it comes to graphics processing units (GPU)," said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. "Investors want the company to take the fight to Nvidia, but for now it is very much struggling to break the moat and disrupt its market position," he added. The drop in AMD's shares on Wednesday erased about $15 billion in stock market value. Its shares fell 18 per cent last year after more than doubling in 2023 on bets the company's AI-optimized graphics processing units would become more competitive against Nvidia's offerings. Nvidia's stock gained 171 per cent in 2024. An increasing push by tech giants including Microsoft and Meta — both AMD customers — to develop in-house chips that are cheaper and more efficient could also hurt demand for AMD's off-the-shelf processors. BofA analysts said that as Nvidia continues to outperform and custom chips gain more traction at hyperscalers, it might be hard for AMD to "win" the AI narrative despite its strong growth levels. The launch of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek's low-cost model has made investors more wary of heavy spending on AI chips, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.

While markets respond to the shift in demand created by Chinese AI company DeepSeek, AMD's CEO Lisa Su provided some comments on the state of hardware sales moving forward.

NVIDIA suffered the most from this crash, famously losing $600 billion in market valuation and 17% in stock price over a single day. AMD, however, has been somewhat resistant to the crash due to its relatively minor involvement in the AI sector. Since the DeepSeek R1 model launched on January 20th, AMD's stock price has decreased by just 2.3%, while NVIDIA is still down by approximately 15%. AMD's Instinct MI400 accelerator (Credit: AMD) Su also anticipates that AMD's next-gen Instinct accelerators will drive billions of dollars in annual revenue over the coming years, despite the speculation that less computing power will be required to produce next-gen AI models. Su was resistant to committing to a specific revenue figure for the accelerators. AMD's CEO is not the only major tech company to praise DeepSeek recently, with the chiefs of Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google each issuing statements in favor of the innovation. The common sentiment is that lowering the cost of artificial intelligence will be a net positive for the industry, with AI adoption only expected to increase. "First of all, I think, tremendous team," Google's Sundar Pichai said of DeepSeek. "I think they've done very, very good work." "First of all, I think, tremendous team," Google's Sundar Pichai said of DeepSeek. "I think they've done very, very good work." Even as AI hardware giants suffer historic losses, top executives from AMD to Google are praising DeepSeek's efficiency as a positive shift for the industry. Whether this optimism will translate into long-term gains remains the burning question.

Title: South Dublin soccer club blaming council policy shift for sidelining 20-year clubhouse campaign
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/02/04/south-dublin-soccer-club-blaming-council-policy-shift-for-sidelining-20-year-clubhouse-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A 20-year campaign by a football club in south Co Dublin to get itself a new clubhouse is set to rumble on after it deferred its latest bid for planning permission having been told by local council officials it would not be successful. It is two decades since what is now Sallynoggin Pearse first approached Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council intending to replace its old and deteriorating clubhouse, its officials say. At the time, the local authority said its preference was to relocate the club around the corner from Pearse Park to Sallynoggin Park where they would be given access to a new facility which was then in the planning stage. Planning permission was subsequently obtained in 2007 but the project never went ahead and the then Pearse Rovers stayed where they were. By 2018 relocating the club became a priority when its existing clubhouse was vandalised. After the council initially said again it would build a new clubhouse in Sallynoggin Park if the club gave up its legal claim to a pitch a local land owner had allowed them to start using almost 50 years earlier, a deal was eventually agreed based on the club funding construction and the council proving the long term lease required to secure grants and loans once the project was in train. Since then, club chairman Richie Cummins says the club has deferred making of planning applications three times at the council’s suggestion. And it was told at a meeting in November the local authority would not now be honouring its commitment to the long-term lease. “The pre-planning stuff was all positive,” he says. “We are meeting the criteria for mixed-use facilities, not-for-profit groups sharing the facilities with sports groups. We’re ticking all the boxes. There is no issue with the building, no issue with the location of the building. So, we’re at a loss as to what the big issue is here.” Sallynoggin Pearse, the product of a 2010 merger between Pearse Rovers, where Paul McGrath played as a teenager (the hope is to name the clubhouse in his honour), and Sallynoggin Celtic, is a relatively small club. It has just two adult men’s teams, although Cummins makes the point it used to be much bigger and could grow again if it had more certainty over its future facilities. What it has done, however, is form a partnership with Granada FC, which has 90 teams and 1,500 young players. It hopes to use the new clubhouse along with a boxing club and kick-boxing club. Dublin Fire Brigade sports club are interested, a local gardening group would like to use it, and there is talk of a dancing club too. “It’s not just football,” says Cummins. “There’d be other groups using it which is important. The crime prevention officer from Dún Laoghaire said our current building (a 40ft shipping container) was vandalised and the previous building was vandalised because of not being used enough. But the council have used it as another excuse not to support us, saying we are looking for a community centre rather than a sports facility. We have never used that term but we do want something that is of benefit to the community.” He gives a vivid account of dealing with council officialdom, with everything — people, policies, allocated plots of land and pitch allocations — shifting over time. At one point, he and fellow club committee members Shane O’Brien and Paul Bishop say it was suggested they get a solicitor’s letter written to inject urgency into the council’s position — only for the official who had suggested it to stop engaging because they had “gone legal”. The council’s current offer is a vandal proof prefab which, the club was told, would cost more than €200,000 but contain just two dressingrooms and no showers. “Are you really expecting teenage girls to share that with either teenage boys or men?,” asks Granada chairman Ciarán Kane, who says wider frustration with the council over facilities and pitches in particular, has prompted clubs across the area to set aside their rivalries to co-ordinate their campaign for improvements. The lack of joined-up thinking, he says, is also evident in his own club’s home facility in Blackrock which, he says, they are delighted to have but which they have been told they should not make available to community groups during weekdays when it is underutilised. Sallynoggin Pearse might settle for that but instead find themselves frustrated by a shift in council policy which, says Cummins, involves a move away from granting long-term leases to clubs. He cites a recent example of that happening to another club. “We’re not asking them for a penny,” he says. “Just that they honour the commitment they gave us when we gave up our claim to a pitch they wanted. They are creating a situation here where nobody can trust them.” The club has, he says, widespread support among councillors and local TD Richard Boyd Barrett describes the council’s treatment of the club as “shameful” and “inexplicable”. “You would think they would be encouraging projects like this but instead they are putting obstacles in their way. It’s hard to understand, but it’s not unique, I’m not exaggerating when I say I am inundated with clubs in the area raising issues over facilities, pitches and particularly all-weather pitches,” said the People Before Profit–Solidarity TD. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council did not respond to requests for comment. Emmet Malone is Work Correspondent at The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: Turmoil as ADM trims 700 jobs, Salesforce slashes 1,000 after Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon axe

Significant layoffs continue to sweep across major big tech and corporate firms in 2025. Following similar decisions by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Salesforce have joined the expanding list of industry titans trimming their staff. According to Reuters, ADM, a major international grain trader, announced plans to cut up to 700 jobs to reduce expenses by $500 million to $750 million over the next three to five years. Juan Luciano, the company's CEO, stated that "softer market conditions and policy uncertainty" were the main reasons for these layoffs. The action comes as ADM adapts to a shifting global market environment, with difficulties expected in the upcoming year. According to a Bloomberg News report, Salesforce plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees while simultaneously hiring new ones to promote the sales of its new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The story (quoting a source familiar with the matter) said the displaced workers could apply for other roles within the organisation. However, it is yet unknown how the layoffs will impact particular divisions. The announcements follow similar moves by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, which also implemented widespread layoffs in reaction to market instability, industry changes, and economic challenges. Microsoft has started performance-based job cuts, resulting in the affected employees losing their jobs with immediate effect and without any severance pay. Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, is laying off about 3,600 people, or 5% of its staff, according to a Bloomberg report that cited an internal memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Employees impacted will be informed by February 10. In the memo, Zuckerberg wrote, “I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.” According to reports, Amazon intends to make significant layoffs, possibly removing up to 14,000 administrative positions by the beginning of 2025. According to data from a Morgan Stanley paper referenced in news sources, this action is expected to result in significant cost savings of about $3 billion annually. Meanwhile, according to Business Insider, the company is letting go of about 200 workers in the US in its ‘Fashion and Fitness’ division.

Strong interest is expected in the upcoming forward purchase sale of 18 Newmarket Square, one of the few build-to-rent developments expected to come to market this year. It’s understood the development of more than 130 apartments in the Liberties in Dublin 8, which is still under construction, will be brought to the market by CBRE in the first quarter of this year at an asking price of about €80 million. 18 Newmarket Square, which is expected to complete around September of this year, was developed by Revelate Capital, an Irish specialist private equity real estate business, along with Valpre Capital, a London-based private equity real estate investment firm and a UBS-owned real estate platform, Aventicum Real Estate. It is located around a 10-minute walk from St Stephen’s Green and amenities are expected to include a co-working lounge, communal rooftop gardens and a landscaped courtyard, as well as about 500sq m of retail space. The Liberties development is not the only deal of scale coming to the market this year; the sale of a large city centre asset is also due to be announced, with an asking price expected to be in the region of €180 million. Last year residential transactions remained low, at about €466 million – the largest deal was the €150 million sale of the Point Campus student accommodation by German asset manager DWS. It was acquired by US fund Greystar. Developers say issues such as the rent cap, which is up for review at the end of the year, is a factor in the lack of new private rented sector developments. Other residential developments expected to complete this year include Marlet’s Claremont development of more than 500 units in Howth, north Dublin, and Lioncor’s development at Alta Verde in Blackrock, in the south of the city.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) -Blackrock plans to hire nearly 1,200 people to expand its two support hubs in India, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The world's largest asset manager wants to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities in India with the expansion, the report added. The iHubs, as the centers are known, are in the country's financial hub Mumbai and Gurugram, which is near the national capital New Delhi. The new hires will increase total headcount to roughly 3,500 in the two cities, and include more engineers and data experts, according to the report. Blackrock is also inheriting a so-called global capabilities center in India's IT hub Bengaluru, through its proposed deal to acquire data provider Preqin, Bloomberg reported. That center will have roughly 1,500 staff members. Blackrock did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

February 04, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX) Class Period: March 14, 2024 - August 7, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) increasing consumer engagement led to an increase in consumer incentives; (2) Cardlytics could not increase its billings commensurate with the increased consumer engagement; (3) as a result, there was a significant risk that its revenue growth would slow or decline; (4) the changes to Cardlytics’ Ads Decision Engine (“ADE”), which led to increased consumer engagement, led to the “underdelivery” of budgets and customers billing estimates; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Cardlytics’ business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Cardlytics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CDLX Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: AMD’s data center revenue comes up short, leaving investors dismayed

UPDATED 20:36 EST / FEBRUARY 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Investors bailed on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. late today after the chipmaker reported lower-than-expected revenue in its key data center segment, despite posting solid results overall. The company revealed fourth-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.09 per share on record-breaking revenue of $7.66 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. The results came in ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts, with analysts predicting slightly lower earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $7.53 billion. However, the higher revenue was offset by increased costs, resulting in net income of $482 million, down from $667 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin, which measures the revenue that remains after subtracting the direct costs associated with producing goods or services, rose by a single percentage point, to 51%. AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su (pictured) hailed 2024 as a “transformative year” for the company, in which it generated record annual revenue and saw strong earnings growth. “Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing,” she added. Su told analysts on a conference call that the company anticipates “strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth in 2025.” For the first quarter of the year, the company is forecasting sales of $7.1 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, with a higher gross margin of 54%. That compares favorably with the Street’s forecast of $7 billion in sales. The numbers were largely positive, except for the performance of AMD’s most critical business unit, the data center segment, which produces computer chips for data center servers. That business has been growing fast in recent quarters thanks to the insane demand the company has seen for graphics processing units that power artificial intelligent workloads. It showed good momentum in the latest quarter, with revenue up 69%, to $3.86 billion. However, investors were hoping for even faster growth, and had expected the company to deliver $4.14 billion in data center revenue. They were not happy that AMD was unable to meet their lofty expectations, and the company’s stock fell more than 8% in extended trading, wiping out a gain of just over 4% during the regular session. The reaction was perhaps a bit harsh on AMD, which said the data center business grew its sales by 94%, to $12.6 billion, in fiscal 2024. That’s thanks to an increase in sales of its Instinct GPUs and also its EPYC central processing units, which power regular computer servers. AMD positions its newest Instinct MI300X GPU as an alternative to Nvidia Corp.’s chips, which dominate the industry, and it accounted for over $5 billion of sales in the last year, officials said. It has been embraced by some of the biggest data center operators, including Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Web Services Inc. One thing that may have struck investors was that AMD declined to provide a forecast for AI-related revenue for the coming year, which may add fuel to concerns that sales of the Instinct GPUs are slowing down. However, Su insisted that the company sees a “steep, long-term growth trajectory” that will eventually grow to “tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue” in the coming years. Somewhat surprisingly, Su praised the emergence of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek Ltd., which rocked financial markets last week when it became clear that its latest large language model could compete with the most advanced LLMs offered by U.S. companies, despite being built at just a small fraction of the cost. Some investors fear that the rise of lower-cost alternatives might hit chipmakers such as AMD, though perhaps not so much as AI developers such as OpenAI. Su also hailed the Stargate project announced by U.S. President Donald Trump last month, which plans to invest $500 billion in building AI computing infrastructure to ensure the country remains at the forefront of the AI industry. “All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,” Su insisted. All of the talk and buzz around AI has meant that AMD’s other key business, which sells chips for personal computers, has largely been forgotten. But it put in a stellar performance, with sales rising 58% year-over-year, to $2.3 billion, above the consensus estimate of $1.9 billion. AMD’s smaller gaming and embedded businesses both declined, however, reflecting sustained pressures on those segments. The gaming segment saw sales tumble by 59%, to just $563 million, with the company pointing to a drop in “semicustom” sales. Meanwhile, the embedded chip segment saw revenue drop 13%, to $923 million. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said the market is likely being a bit harsh on AMD, as he thinks the company is growing very well in what is still a transitional phase as it shifts its focus to the data center. “Data center revenues were good, up almost 70%, and the client computing business had a record quarter, offsetting the shrinkage in its smaller gaming and embedded segments,” the analyst said. “It looks very good on the profitability side too, with operating income up more than 350%. The problem is that investors wanted to see turbocharged AI growth, but the data center business didn’t grow enough to satisfy such desires. It will need to pull off another epic quarter if it wants its investors to be really happy.” During the quarter, AMD’s venture capital arm, AMD Ventures, participated in a number of big funding rounds, including a $333 million raise by the cloud infrastructure startup Vultr Inc., and a $250 million investment in the AI startup Liquid AI Inc. Last November, the company also announced its intention to lay off about 1,000 workers, or 4% of its total staff, in order to free up more money to invest in AI development. Today’s after-hours price action means AMD’s stock is down 33% in the past 12 months, compared with a 9% gain in the broader iShares Semiconductor ETF.

Somewhat surprisingly, Su praised the emergence of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek Ltd., which rocked financial markets last week when it became clear that its latest large language model could compete with the most advanced LLMs offered by U.S. companies, despite being built at just a small fraction of the cost. Some investors fear that the rise of lower-cost alternatives might hit chipmakers such as AMD, though perhaps not so much as AI developers such as OpenAI. Su also hailed the Stargate project announced by U.S. President Donald Trump last month, which plans to invest $500 billion in building AI computing infrastructure to ensure the country remains at the forefront of the AI industry. “All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,” Su insisted. All of the talk and buzz around AI has meant that AMD’s other key business, which sells chips for personal computers, has largely been forgotten. But it put in a stellar performance, with sales rising 58% year-over-year, to $2.3 billion, above the consensus estimate of $1.9 billion. AMD’s smaller gaming and embedded businesses both declined, however, reflecting sustained pressures on those segments. The gaming segment saw sales tumble by 59%, to just $563 million, with the company pointing to a drop in “semicustom” sales. Meanwhile, the embedded chip segment saw revenue drop 13%, to $923 million. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said the market is likely being a bit harsh on AMD, as he thinks the company is growing very well in what is still a transitional phase as it shifts its focus to the data center. “Data center revenues were good, up almost 70%, and the client computing business had a record quarter, offsetting the shrinkage in its smaller gaming and embedded segments,” the analyst said. “It looks very good on the profitability side too, with operating income up more than 350%. The problem is that investors wanted to see turbocharged AI growth, but the data center business didn’t grow enough to satisfy such desires. It will need to pull off another epic quarter if it wants its investors to be really happy.” During the quarter, AMD’s venture capital arm, AMD Ventures, participated in a number of big funding rounds, including a $333 million raise by the cloud infrastructure startup Vultr Inc., and a $250 million investment in the AI startup Liquid AI Inc. Last November, the company also announced its intention to lay off about 1,000 workers, or 4% of its total staff, in order to free up more money to invest in AI development. Today’s after-hours price action means AMD’s stock is down 33% in the past 12 months, compared with a 9% gain in the broader iShares Semiconductor ETF.

US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

US stock futures pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) led declines, down 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.5% as markets assessed the latest tech results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, after the major gauges closed with gains. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down almost 7% in pre-market trading, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. AI trade hopes were dealt a second blow by AMD's earnings. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 8%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple shares dropped over 2% after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. But looking past the noisy headlines, the stock market has shown several signs of strength, providing Wall Street with ample reason to stay bullish on further gains. That said, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs has prompted Morgan Stanley to lower its forecast for US interest-rate cuts this year. It now forecasts just one cut from the Federal Reserve in 2025. Updates on US services activity and private payrolls due later will help set expectations for the path of rates. On the earnings front, Disney (DIS) is set to report before the bell on Wednesday. The entertainment giant's theme parks and Disney+ streaming platform are both expected to show headwinds. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius out this morning with his latest call on tariffs — of note he expects 10% China tariffs as just the starting point" "While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been paused, the 10% additional tariff on imports from China has taken effect, and we expect that these tariffs will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. Our base case is that tariffs on imports from China increase further, though President Trump’s comments since inauguration have put much less emphasis on China than during the campaign. Nevertheless, we expect China-focused tariffs to rise by roughly another 10pp on top of the recently announced tariffs, via higher tariffs on primarily non-consumer products. An even higher tariff rate is a clear possibility—Trump recently mentioned the 60% tariff he proposed during the campaign—but we don’t view this as the base case." Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter last night. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit pre-market likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates and the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for the Street. Calls out KeyBanc analyst John Vinh this morning, "For FY25, management conveyed confidence in being able to deliver double digit year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. However, they stopped issuing GPU-related revenue guidance (key to the story in FY24 and a figure investors were keenly listening for), and instead offered mixed commentary tied to MI300 [chip], MI325 and MI350 that implied lower-than-anticipated sales on MI300 and MI325 in 1H25 (Data Center revenues in the first half of 2025 to resemble second half 2024), but a faster-than expected ramp on MI350 starting in mid-2025 (vs. 2H25 prior). Incremental uncertainty around Data Center mix-shift and the pace and scope of GPU product ramp through 2025 is not what we were hoping for, and neither was the market, but we think it could be pointing to a transition period (i.e. ramping faster on MI350 could be impacting MI300 and MI325) that could set up 2H25 and 2026 for outpaced results." Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted pre-market, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft and margin commentary was mixed. January sales off to a slow start, too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance. Toyota Motor (TM)raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen.

Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong. Gold (GC=F) has surged to a record high, climbing nearly 1% as the first shots of the US-China trade war increase demand for haven assets. The price of bullion hit an all-time high, topping $2,854 an ounce on Wednesday. This spike followed President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. China’s retaliatory efforts have been less aggressive compared to earlier trade conflicts, when tariffs were nearly on par with the U.S. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on the world’s two largest economies. Markets are also closely watching to see if these renewed tariffs could trigger inflationary pressures, which might influence US monetary policy. Asian stocks were mostly lower Wednesday as markets digested the impact of the trade tensions brewing between China and the US. The CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) quickly erased its initial gains on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday closure, falling by 0.6%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi (^KS11) jumped 1.1% What started as a relatively calm day quickly became volatile after news broke that the US Postal Service would temporarily halt inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong. This move came just one day after both the US and China imposed tariffs on each other’s exports. Although there are still hopes for a deal to ease tensions, investors are pulling back as uncertainty lingers. The stock outlook remains unclear, largely dependent on further developments in tariff negotiations and China's economic recovery. US President Donald Trump stated there is no urgency to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks.

"That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) led declines, down 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.5% as markets assessed the latest tech results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, after the major gauges closed with gains. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down almost 7% in pre-market trading, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. AI trade hopes were dealt a second blow by AMD's earnings. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 8%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple shares dropped over 2% after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. But looking past the noisy headlines, the stock market has shown several signs of strength, providing Wall Street with ample reason to stay bullish on further gains. That said, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs has prompted Morgan Stanley to lower its forecast for US interest-rate cuts this year. It now forecasts just one cut from the Federal Reserve in 2025. Updates on US services activity and private payrolls due later will help set expectations for the path of rates. On the earnings front, Disney (DIS) is set to report before the bell on Wednesday. The entertainment giant's theme parks and Disney+ streaming platform are both expected to show headwinds. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius out this morning with his latest call on tariffs — of note he expects 10% China tariffs as just the starting point" "While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been paused, the 10% additional tariff on imports from China has taken effect, and we expect that these tariffs will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. Our base case is that tariffs on imports from China increase further, though President Trump’s comments since inauguration have put much less emphasis on China than during the campaign. Nevertheless, we expect China-focused tariffs to rise by roughly another 10pp on top of the recently announced tariffs, via higher tariffs on primarily non-consumer products. An even higher tariff rate is a clear possibility—Trump recently mentioned the 60% tariff he proposed during the campaign—but we don’t view this as the base case." Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter last night. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit pre-market likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates and the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for the Street. Calls out KeyBanc analyst John Vinh this morning, "For FY25, management conveyed confidence in being able to deliver double digit year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. However, they stopped issuing GPU-related revenue guidance (key to the story in FY24 and a figure investors were keenly listening for), and instead offered mixed commentary tied to MI300 [chip], MI325 and MI350 that implied lower-than-anticipated sales on MI300 and MI325 in 1H25 (Data Center revenues in the first half of 2025 to resemble second half 2024), but a faster-than expected ramp on MI350 starting in mid-2025 (vs. 2H25 prior). Incremental uncertainty around Data Center mix-shift and the pace and scope of GPU product ramp through 2025 is not what we were hoping for, and neither was the market, but we think it could be pointing to a transition period (i.e. ramping faster on MI350 could be impacting MI300 and MI325) that could set up 2H25 and 2026 for outpaced results." Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted pre-market, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft and margin commentary was mixed. January sales off to a slow start, too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance. Toyota Motor (TM)raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong. Gold (GC=F) has surged to a record high, climbing nearly 1% as the first shots of the US-China trade war increase demand for haven assets. The price of bullion hit an all-time high, topping $2,854 an ounce on Wednesday. This spike followed President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. China’s retaliatory efforts have been less aggressive compared to earlier trade conflicts, when tariffs were nearly on par with the U.S. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on the world’s two largest economies. Markets are also closely watching to see if these renewed tariffs could trigger inflationary pressures, which might influence US monetary policy. Asian stocks were mostly lower Wednesday as markets digested the impact of the trade tensions brewing between China and the US. The CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) quickly erased its initial gains on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday closure, falling by 0.6%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi (^KS11) jumped 1.1% What started as a relatively calm day quickly became volatile after news broke that the US Postal Service would temporarily halt inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong. This move came just one day after both the US and China imposed tariffs on each other’s exports. Although there are still hopes for a deal to ease tensions, investors are pulling back as uncertainty lingers. The stock outlook remains unclear, largely dependent on further developments in tariff negotiations and China's economic recovery. US President Donald Trump stated there is no urgency to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Jim Jordan Readies His Committee For Another Showdown Against Administrative State

Members of a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee have scheduled a Feb. 11 hearing to consider ways to limit the administrative state’s ability to impose new regulations. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20 imposing a freeze on new regulations. House Republicans, meanwhile, say they plan to support legislation that would place additional controls on government regulations. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith, entrepreneur Magatte Wade and Hoover Institution Research Fellow Dr. Patrick McLaughlin are scheduled to testify at the Feb. 11 hearing. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Joni Ernst Takes Another Crack At Evicting Bureaucrats From Washington) “The American people trust President Trump and Republicans to strengthen our country,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That starts with transparency into government bureaucracy and cutting unnecessary red tape to make sure the American economy can thrive.” The hearing, titled “Reining in the Administrative State: Regulatory and Administrative Law Reform,” will likely discuss HR 142, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, introduced by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida. The REINS Act addresses executive overreach and ensures that every new major rule with a cost of more than $100M to be approved by Congress. Republican administration or Democrat administration, burdensome regulations affect us all. It’s time to #MakeItREINS and pass H.R. 277. pic.twitter.com/3EYmcIK5Wg — Rep. Cammack Press Office (@RepKatCammack) June 6, 2023 “The Supreme Court’s ruling in Loper Bright made it clear that Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, make the law. But more must be done to check the unconstitutional overreach of the administrative state,” Republican Rep. Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust, told the DCNF. “Not only should we codify the Loper Bright decision, but we should ensure rules that exceed the agency’s statutory authority are narrowed or repealed. This hearing will give members an opportunity to make those determinations.” The legislation would require both houses of Congress to approve “major rules,” defined as regulations with an effect of $100 million or more each year, through a joint resolution that the president of the United States would have to sign or veto. Currently, under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a regulation during a certain window of time, but the disapproval is subject to a presidential veto. President Joe Biden vetoed a bipartisan disapproval of one regulation targeting trucks in June 2023. The Biden administration proposed new regulations in 2023 targeting stoves and other appliances using natural gas, citing a study that says that gas stoves account for 12.7% of asthma cases among children. (Click Here To Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged: Death Of The American Voter”) The Biden administration blocked efforts to start mining for copper and nickel near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota in January 2023, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency made a determination on Jan. 31, 2023 that would block the mining of 1.4 billion tons of copper, gold, molybdenum, silver and rhenium in Alaska in order to protect salmon. The Biden administration — saying they needed to fight climate change — also pushed for the adoption of electric vehicles, including the imposition of fuel-efficiency regulations for light and medium vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter.

"We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq recover as traders assess tariff developments, new jobs data

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year.

Title: Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) One of Bill Ackman’s Top Stock Picks?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Bill Ackman’s Stock Portfolio: Top 9 Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other stocks to buy in Bill Ackman’s portfolio. William Albert Ackman, more commonly known as Bill Ackman, is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Famous for his concentrated portfolio, with stakes in only 8 to 12 stocks at a time, Bill Ackman’s recent portfolio modification has revealed that 47% of his hedge fund is invested in just three stocks. Analysis of his portfolio reveals that Bill Ackman invests in stocks that are mispriced relative to the long-term value of the company. Historically, this philosophy has served him well since Pershing Square’s total value was just under $13 billion by the end of the third quarter of 2024 with only 9 stocks. A longtime supporter of the Trump administration, Ackman has been vocal about the benefits that the newly elected president will bring to the investment front. In addition to the prospects of deregulation and corporate tax cuts that could allow for stock prices to rise and have made many investors bullish on the market, Bill Ackman has more vested interests in the Trump office. Pershing has a roughly 10% stake in the common shares of the government-sponsored entities. He took to X to discuss his hypothesis about how Donald Trump could help these giants exit government conservatorship and be recapitalized, leading to substantial shareholder gains for Pershing Square. In early 2024, Ackman launched a U.S. closed-ended fund called Pershing Square USA, Ltd., and talked about it during his 2024 letter to investors: “The launch of PSUS is one of a number of strategic initiatives we plan to undertake which we believe will increase the long term sustainability of Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., (“PSCM” or the “Investment Manager”), and will benefit PSH by reducing the performance fees that it pays. To this end, in June, we sold a 10% interest in PSCM, the proceeds of which will be used to anchor new fund launches including PSUS.” However, Pershing Square officially canceled its IPO just one day after filing with the SEC due to a $2 billion listing as opposed to its original target valuation of $25 billion. Finally, while announcing the IPO cancellation on X, Ackman wrote “We will report back once we are ready to launch a revised transaction,” hinting at the possible launch of PSUS without listing shares on a stock exchange. The stocks discussed below were picked from Pershing Square’s Q3 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of Pershing Square’s stake in them as of September 30, 2024. In order to assist readers with more perspective, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities. Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q3: 202 Pershing Square’s Equity Stake: $1.26 Billion Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the only stock that Ackman holds in the technology sector, and hence the only holding that allows Pershing Square to participate in the race for artificial intelligence. Although Ackman has maintained its stake in the company across the second and third quarters of 2024, its equity stake has fallen from $1.38 billion at the end of Q2 2024 to $1.26 billion by the end of Q3 the same year. Popular for its leading search engine Google, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also involved in developing artificial intelligence, mobile operating systems, and cloud computing services to make money through the sale of advertising and various service fees. Although revenue from Google Cloud is growing rapidly, the company still generates most of its revenue from Google Adsense, the branch that deals with advertising. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s revenue for Q3 2024 was $88.27 billion, up 11% from the same period the previous year, and compared to the analysts’ expectations of $86.39 billion. Its net income for the quarter was $26.3 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 33.6%. Operating income was $28.5 billion, compared with $21.3 billion for the same quarter in 2023. It beat the consensus estimate of $1.83 by $0.29, reporting earnings per share for the quarter to be $2.12 against $1.55 EPS for the same period in 2023. Google has partnered with HP to integrate its Project Starline with popular video conferencing platforms, Google Meet and Zoom, and is set to launch the 3D video call technology in 2025. After refining the technology, initially designed for a booth setup, into a more accessible screen-based format, Google is now preparing to introduce Project Starline to the broader public to improve the video conferencing experience. In addition, Google Cloud, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has revealed that streaming powerhouses Spotify and Paramount Global are now using its newly developed Axion chip for enhanced performance and efficiency, further strengthening the position of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an industry leader in artificial intelligent. Oakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the top contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.-headquartered interactive media and services company’s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they’re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 8th on our list of stocks to buy in Bill Ackman’s portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential for GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: AMD posts Q4 earnings beat, strong Q1 forecast

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and providing a better-than-anticipated Q1 forecast. The chipmaker's announcement comes the same day President Donald Trump enacted a 10% tariff on goods made in China and a little over a week after China-based DeepSeek rocked the tech world with its low-cost AI models. Despite the earnings beat and stronger guidance, AMD stock fell over 3.5% in after-hours trading. AMD is battling to take market share in the AI space from rival Nvidia (NVDA), which dominates sales of high-powered AI chips. At the same time, the company is contending with a continued slowdown in PC sales, even as the industry works to push consumers and enterprises toward AI PCs — computers that feature specialized processors designed to power AI tasks. For the quarter, AMD reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.09 on revenue of $7.56 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $1.09 and revenue of $7.5 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company’s data center business, its largest segment by revenue, brought in $3.9 billion, just shy of expectations of $4.09 billion for the quarter. AMD’s client segment, which includes chips for PCs, generated $2.3 billion for the quarter. Analysts were anticipating revenue of $1.98 billion. The company also saw Gaming revenue of $563 million. Wall Street was looking for $487 million. For the current quarter, AMD anticipates revenue between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion. Wall Street had expected $7.0 billion. AMD shares have struggled throughout the last 12 months, falling 33% compared to rival Nvidia, which has jumped 80%. Still, that’s better than archnemesis Intel (INTC), which has seen shares fall 54% in the same time period. While Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods won’t impact the majority of the high-end chip market, since many are manufactured in areas like Taiwan, the broader market for electronics, including servers and PCs, which are built in China, will be impacted. Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you? If businesses and consumers are turned off by higher prices on those systems and devices, chip manufacturers like AMD could face slowing sales. Beyond the tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump has also raised the specter of tariffs specifically targeting semiconductors and products associated with them in a bid to bring manufacturing to the US. But those kinds of tariffs drive up prices for consumers for a long stretch of time, as building chip facilities is a complex task that takes years to complete.

Title: Shayne Bolton’s arrival in Ireland squad could give UK press a fit of the vapours
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/04/shayne-boltons-arrival-in-ireland-squad-could-give-uk-press-a-fit-of-the-vapours/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T20:44:42Z

Readers of UK Sunday papers might have thought this week that it was a case of right-back-at-ya from Irish rugby. The pithy observation of Sunday Times rugby correspondent Stephen Jones that Ireland “thrived on the needle-sharp incisiveness of Jamison Gibson-Park at scrumhalf, James Lowe on the wing, Mack Hansen on the other wing, Bundee Aki in midfield – and they were also well served by the odd Irish-born player” was met with this week’s announcement that Connacht’s Shayne Bolton and Munster’s Tom Ahern were to come in to the Irish squad. The truth is that the remark and the pair’s arrival into the Irish camp was a coincidence. But it has played out sweetly as Bolton, coming in for the injured Hansen, is an Irish-qualified player who was born in Pretoria, South Africa. It is not Bolton’s first breath of the thin air of a national squad. He was included by Simon Easterby in last year’s Emerging Ireland squad, only for an injury in the 33rd minute of Connacht’s opening URC game against Munster in Thomond Park to force him out of that tour. Irish-qualified through his grandmother, Bolton has been with Connacht since 2021 and last March signed a contract that would keep him in Galway for two more years until 2026. In November, Connacht coach Pete Wilkins spoke of the qualities that have made him a favourite in Dexcom Stadium. [ Shayne Bolton’s journey from South Africa can see him flourish with ConnachtOpens in new window ] “We’re delighted with the progress Shayne has made this season, and he is rightly establishing himself in the team as a fast and powerful option on the wing,” he said. “I am excited about his potential for further development over the next two years and he is another great example of the type of player that our supporters are so excited to watch and get behind.” Wilkins might have added that lightning pace also comes with the 24-year-old. Far from being a rangy winger, Bolton arrives compact at about 100kg and strong enough to also play in the centre. He joins that subset of players in the Irish squad that can seamlessly move around positions, as Garry Ringrose did last weekend against England. Ringrose switched from 13 to the wing when Hansen went off in the first half and reverted to the outside centre when the Australian-born winger returned. The move will probably excite a lot of people and even if it is only for a few days, it will be seen as an opportunity for Bolton to pick up the mood and character of life in the Irish camp. He was contacted initially in South Africa by Andy Friend, who was then the Connacht head coach. Friend knew the then 20-year-old was Irish qualified and that the pursuit of his dream to play professional rugby was greater than his desire to stay in college. In an interview in this paper last year, Bolton described how he left South Africa for the first time to travel alone to a country he didn’t know much about. It was during the Covid pandemic of 2020, and the aeroplane was ghostly empty. He had a row of seats to himself and everyone on board was wearing a protective mask, so there were zero conversations. When he arrived, the warm Irish welcome was quarantine for 14 days in a hotel in Dublin because he was arriving from a red-listed country. At the time countries were listed as green, amber or red, with different safety protocols around each colour. The youngest of five children, Bolton was offered bursaries and scholarships but because his parents did not want to send him away to boarding school, he went to one close to where he lived. He played age-grade rugby for the Bulls at under-16 and under-18 and was in the Cheetahs academy for two years. However, he was denied an extension with the Bloemfontein franchise, although continued to play for the University of the Free State in the Varsity Cup. [ Connacht sign Irish-qualified South African prodigy Shayne BoltonOpens in new window ] In hindsight, timing was good, and it was when he was playing college rugby that the phone call arrived from Friend. “I’m very close to my gran,” he said in November. “She lives close by to my parents in South Africa, and I saw her every Sunday or every second Sunday, and I was always aware that my family comes from here. Her parents died when she was young in a car crash, so she was sent to England for a couple of years and then to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent most of her life.” Gran is Noreen Stapleton, who originally came from the Dublin suburb of Blackrock. She can be proud that her grandson has already been charming people with his Irish accent. “We plucked him out of a backwater in South Africa and saw him as a project,” Wilkins told RTÉ. “It was a bit of experimentation, trying him as that power winger on the right wing and he’s just thrived on it, getting his hands on the ball and a bit more space around him. “So, there’s more to come from him. I think there’s incredible explosiveness and just a real confidence about him when he’s got the ball in hand.” Given this week, prophetic words.

Treace Medical Concepts (TMCI) is jumping 7.5% after investment bank BTIG upgraded the shares to Buy from Neutral. Why BTIG Upgraded the Shares Treace provides technology that facilitates Lapiplasty bunion surgery and related midfoot deformities. The company recently introduced a new technique called the SpeedAkin™ Anatomic Compression Implant. The "implant broadens the procedural versatility of Treace’s flagship SpeedPlate™ fixation platform," Treace reported. A specialist operating a modern medical device in a clinical setting. Specifically, it helps "stabilize the Akin osteotomy during healing," the company stated. The Akin osteotomy "corrects the sideways deviation of the big toe." BTIG is bullish on the changes made by the company recently in response to intensified competition, saying that the moves have improved its outlook. BTIG is also upbeat on the company's upcoming products and believes that the firm is well-positioned to increase its reimbursements from payors. BTIG also reports that its survey about Treace's offering yielded positive results. The investment bank placed a $16 price target on Treace Medical.

Title: Estée Lauder Laments ‘Lost Agility’ and Cuts up to 7K Jobs

Consumer pullback around the world is leading Estée Lauder to cut thousands of jobs. The beauty brand released earnings Tuesday (Feb. 4) showing declining or flat sales in its markets around the globe, especially in Asia, where sales fell by double digits. Speaking to analysts during an earnings call, CEO Stéphane de La Faverie discussed some of the factors that have hurt the company’s performance in recent years, including “subdued” consumer sentiment in China and a “narrow focus” on too few markets. “This was especially true in North America. Simply said we lost our agility,” de La Faverie said. “We did not capitalize on the higher growth opportunities quickly enough. In channels, markets, media and prestige price tiers nor fuel new consumer acquisition aggressively enough.” To that end, the company is embarking on a turnaround campaign that involves the elimination of 5,800 to 7,000 jobs, though that number takes into account reductions of employees after retraining and redeployment of some workers. Estée Lauder says it also plans to expand its presence in certain channels and markets to take part in “key growth opportunities in prestige beauty” while also boosting consumer-facing investments by increasing ad spending. “We know we didn’t make fast move in terms of new distribution when the consumer was moving,” de La Faverie added. “That’s what we’ve demonstrated with the move that we’ve made a few months ago with Amazon and many of us like TikTok Shop in Asia and even in the U.S. So we’re going to really measure how quickly we move in this channel and how much we can like to capture lapsed consumers but also new consumers.” The company also recently teamed with OpenAI recently to implement artificial intelligence (AI) across its brands. The companies developed 240 AI applications to analyze consumer data and create products for its various brands. “The facility processes data from consumer surveys and clinical trials for the company’s beauty brands,” that report said. “Two primary applications have emerged from the development process: one analyzes consumer survey data for fragrance development, while another processes clinical trial results.” As PYMNTS wrote at the time, other beauty companies are also investing in AI for consumer-facing and product development. For example, L’Oréal expanded its use of Modiface, an AI and augmented reality platform that allows users to virtually try on makeup and experiment with hair colors. And Sephora’s Virtual Artist tool lets customers find their ideal foundation shade using facial recognition and a skin tone database, improving accuracy and inclusivity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: GAMCO Investors, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2024

February 04, 2025 14:51 ET | Source: GAMCO Investors, Inc. GAMCO Investors, Inc. GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GAMCO Investors, Inc. (“Gabelli”) (OTCQX: GAMI) today reported its operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Financial Highlights Giving Back to Society - $80 million since IPO Since our initial public offering in February 1999, our firm’s combined charitable donations total approximately $80 million, including $48 million through the shareholder designated charitable contribution program. Based on the program created by Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, our corporate charitable giving is unique in that the recipients of Gabelli’s charitable contributions are chosen directly by our shareholders, rather than by our corporate officers. Since its inception in 2013, Gabelli shareholders have designated charitable gifts to approximately 350 charitable organizations. On August 6, 2024, Gabelli’s board of directors authorized the creation of a private foundation, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, to continue our charitable giving program with an initial contribution of $5 million. Revenue The year over year increase in Funds revenues was primarily the result of higher average assets under management. The increase in Institutional and Private Wealth Management revenues was primarily the result of higher beginning of the quarter equity assets under management, which are generally used to calculate the revenues. The decrease in SICAV revenues reflects a change in the agreement for the merger arbitrage SICAV, an open-end fund available to non-U.S. shareholders, which became effective in December 2023. The change better aligns the financial arrangements with the services rendered by each party in managing the fund and did not have a material impact on the financial results. The decrease in distribution fees and other income was primarily the result of a decrease in equity mutual funds AUM that pay distribution fees. Expenses Operating Margin The operating margin, which represents the ratio of operating income to revenue, was 32.3% for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with 27.6% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-Operating Income Non-operating income decreased $2.7 million for the quarter, reflecting the lower mark-to-market net gains on our investment portfolio for the quarter slightly offset by an increase in interest and dividend income. Other Financial Highlights The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 25.7% versus 24.7% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $182.8 million with no debt at December 31, 2024. Assets Under Management Assets under management on December 31, 2024 were $31.7 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from the $32.2 billion on September 30, 2024. The quarter’s decrease consisted of net market depreciation of $0.2 billion, net outflows of $0.2 billion, and distributions, net of reinvestments, of $0.1 billion. Mutual Funds Assets under management in Mutual Funds on December 31, 2024 were $8.1 billion, a decrease of 4.3% from the $8.4 billion at September 30, 2024. The quarterly change was attributed to: Closed-end Funds Assets under management in Closed-end Funds on December 31, 2024 were $7.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5% from the $7.5 billion on September 30, 2024. The quarterly change was comprised of: Institutional & PWM Assets under management in Institutional & PWM on December 31, 2024 were $10.7 billion, a decrease of 0.9% from the $10.8 billion on December 31, 2023. The quarterly change was due to: SICAV Assets under management were $9 million in the GAMCO All Cap Value sleeve and the GAMCO Convertible Securities sleeve on December 31, 2024 versus $11 million in those sleeves at December 31, 2023. 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund Assets under management in our 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (GABXX) on December 31, 2024 were $5.6 billion, up from $5.3 billion at September 30, 2024. The Gabelli Growth Fund – Up 35.8% For 2024 The Growth team of Howard Ward, CFA, and John Belton, CFA, commented on The Gabelli Growth Fund’s 2024 performance: “The environment remained favorable for growth stocks in 2024, underpinned by a resilient economy and the start of a Federal Reserve interest rate cutting cycle. Earnings growth accelerated for many US companies, aided by healthy consumer spending trends, robust technology investments, and continued cost discipline. Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained a key stock market theme, as capital expenditure plans across the hyperscale cloud computing group reached astronomical levels, and given a host of new AI-centric business models which have started to take shape. To date, this technology appears to be making some of the strongest companies, stronger, and to that end we maintained positions in many of the largest AI beneficiaries including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This group remains a cornerstone of our portfolio, and as of year-end more than half of the portfolio’s assets are invested across the Technology Sector as a whole. Outside of the Megacap Tech group, top performers to performance this year included Eli Lilly (boosted by continued success across an industry-leading incretin drug portfolio), ServiceNow (which is an early leader in AI software commercialization) and Intuitive Surgical.” The Gabelli Gold Fund – Up 15.2% For 2024 Portfolio manager Caesar Bryan commented on The Gabelli Gold Fund’s 2024 performance: “Gold performed strongly for the second consecutive year largely driven by overseas central bank purchases. However, gold equities underperformed the gold price. Recently the rise in the gold price has not been fully reflected in the profit margins of gold mining companies. This has largely been due to cost pressures emanating from a variety of sources, exacerbated by covid. But we believe the market may be too pessimistic concerning both cost pressures which are diminishing and enhanced revenues from a higher gold price. Gold equities are inexpensive relative to their history and on an absolute basis. But a catalyst is needed to alter investor perception. This could be gold backed ETFs adding ounces reflecting a recovery in investor interest in the sector, a decline in other asset markets which may highlight gold as a portfolio diversifier, increased takeover activity or simply continued strength in the gold price. Some of our smaller gold producers such as Lundin Gold and Wesdome Gold Mines, had stellar returns. Among our larger producers Kinross and Agnico Eagle contributed significantly to performance.

Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. These ETFs do not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example:• You may have to pay more money to trade the ETFs’ shares. These ETFs will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information. • The price you pay to buy ETF shares on an exchange may not match the value of an ETF’s portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. These price differences may be greater for these ETFs compared to other ETFs because they provide less information to traders. • These additional risks may be even greater in challenging or uncertain market conditions. • The differences between these ETFs and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the ETFs undisclosed, these ETFs may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the ETFs’ performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the ETFs’ investment strategies, however, this may hurt the ETFs’ performance.

The Federation of National Trade Unions, known as CSN, said Tuesday it plans to petition a court to order Amazon to reopen seven warehouses and restore the 1,700 jobs lost as a result of the closures. Amazon announced in late January it would phase out seven sites in Quebec "following a recent review" of its operations in the province, which is the only location in Canada with unionized Amazon employees. The company said it would return to a third-party delivery model, enlisting subcontractors to handle deliveries. The CSN estimated that roughly 4,500 jobs were cut by Amazon and its subcontractors as a result of the closures. "Amazon thinks it can just shift the work to other corporate entities and outsource some warehousing and delivery operations," CSN President Caroline Senneville said in a statement. "What it calls the 'new business model' is just an attempt to circumvent its obligations under the Labour Code. The court should recognize that this scheme violates the law and it can then order the reinstatement of Amazon's workers." Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said reverting to a third-party delivery model, which it used in Quebec before 2020, will allow the company to "provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run." "In making this decision, we've complied and will continue to comply with all the applicable federal and provincial laws," Agrait said in a statement. The CSN represents roughly 240 Amazon workers at a warehouse near the Montreal suburb of Laval. Workers at the site unionized last May, becoming the first Amazon warehouse in Canada to do so. Following the closures, Canada's industry minister, Francoise-Philippe Champagne, wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expressing his "disappointment" over the decision, saying it "raises questions about your commitment to Canada and your Canadian partners." Champagne said the government would consider conducting a review of its current deals with Amazon. Amazon said the vice president of its Canada business spoke with Champagne after the company announced the closures. The company also faces growing labor pressure in the U.S. Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are slated to vote next week on whether to join a union, while Whole Foods workers in Philadelphia voted Jan. 27 to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Amazon employees at a facility in Staten Island, New York, in 2022 formed the company's first union at a U.S. warehouse, though they have yet to secure a contract. The group voted to affiliate with the Teamsters in June. WATCH: Tariffs' toll on e-commerce Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Tech layoffs this year: A timeline
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816579/tech-layoffs-this-year-a-timeline.html
Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:40:51Z
Full Content:
2025 began in turmoil, with layoffs at some of the largest tech companies despite the support shown by the new US administration. 2024 had been a year of recovery, with the pace of layoffs slowing and IT employment the highest for years following two years of massive IT layoff in 2022 and 2023. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. In 2025, it has already logged 7,003 staff laid off by 31 companies. Here is a list — to be updated regularly — of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. As it moves to invest more in AI and international growth, Workday is laying off 8.5% of its workforce and disposing of unused office space. Some analysts fear the cutbacks will affect the company’s customer service — unless AI can pick up the slack. At the same time as it’s hiring sales staff for its new artificial intelligence products, Salesforce is laying off over 1,000 workers across the company, according to Bloomberg. As of June, 2024, the company had over 72,000 employees, according to its website. Salesforce did not comment on the report. In 2024 the company reportedly laid off around 1,000 staff too, in two waves: January and July. Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees he intended to “move out the low performers faster” in an internal memo reported by Bloomberg. The memo announced that the company will lay off 5% of its staff, or around 3,600 staff, beginning Feb. 10. The company had already reduced its headcount by 5% in 2024 through natural attrition, the memo said. Among those leaving the company will be staff previously responsible for fact checking of posts on its social media platforms in the US, as the company begins relying on its users to police content. Despite intense demand for its data center capacity, Equinix is planning to lay off 3% of its workforce, or around 400 employees. The announcement followed the appointment of Adaire Fox-Martin to replace Charles Meyers as CEO and the departures of two other senior executives, CIO Milind Wagle and CISO Michael Montoya. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said. The move came as a surprise to staff, as the company also reported strong quarterly earnings. Enterprise software vendor Freshworks laid off around 660 staff, or around 13% of its headcount, despite reporting increased revenue and profits in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company described the layoffs as a realignment of its global workforce. After laying off around 4,200 staff in February, Cisco is at it again, laying off another 6,000 or around 7% of its workforce. Among the divisions affected were its threat intelligence unit, Talos Security. More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies. Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.” OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said. Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving. Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Alphabet Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings (CORRECTED)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will release its fourth-quarter financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, Feb. 4. Analysts expect the Arkansas-based company to report quarterly earnings at $2.13 per share, up from 69 cents per share in the year-ago period. Alphabet projects quarterly revenue of $96.65 billion, compared to $13.32 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in seven straight quarters and topped analyst expectations for earnings per share in seven straight quarters. With the recent buzz around Alphabet, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. At the moment, Alphabet offers an annual dividend yield of 0.39%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 20 cents per share (80 cents a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Alphabet, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Alphabet's $0.80 dividend: $6,000 / $0.80 = 7,500 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,509,225 worth of Alphabet, or 7,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.80 = 1,500 shares, or $301,845 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on GOOGL Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. GOOG Price Action: Shares of Alphabet fell by 1.4% to close at $201.23 on Monday.

NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

Title: Tech layoffs in 2024: a timeline

After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there were early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continued to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs seen through the year were an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce—as well as many smaller companies —announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. Here’s a round-up of some of the most significant. See news of more recent layoffs. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said.

More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies. Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.” OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said. Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving. Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications. Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Roughly 8% of Microsoft’s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lion’s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary. Microsoft completed its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023, paying nearly $69 billion. About 1,900 employees will be let go, along with two executives at Blizzard: Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham. A pending survival game title, according to Reuters, has also been cancelled. The layoffs were largely expected in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition. German enterprise software giant SAP said this week that 8,000 jobs will be “impacted” by a large-scale shift in company priorities towards generative artificial intelligence (genAI). It’s unclear how many of the affected employees will be laid off, as the company has said many of the impacts will involve “voluntary leave programs and internal re-skilling measures.” SAP said the restructuring will not result in an overall loss of headcount. The company cut more than 3,000 jobs in 2023. Analysts expect the move to skew SAP’s workforce younger and more expert in genAI. Online retailer eBay plans to cut nearly 10% of its workforce—about 1,000 jobs—saying “in an official blog post that “headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business.” All of the company’s US workforce was told to work from home Wednesday as the firings were carried out via Zoom. Additionally, eBay said it would “scale back” on its work with outside contractors in a further attempt to rein in costs. The company fired 500 workers last year after sales slackened in the wake of the pandemic boom, according to NPR. Google’s ad sales team lost several hundred staff from its large customer department, part of the company’s move to automate some jobs with machine learning. Reports suggest that more staffers from the ad sales team were also let go in October 2023. The company also laid off hundreds more employees from its digital voice assistant, Fitbit, and Pixel teams earlier in the week. Google has been steadily shedding jobs since January 2023, when parent company Alphabet downsized its entire workforce by 6% across the board, putting 12,000 people out of work. Alphabet announced that it is laying off hundreds of employees from several teams, including engineering and the teams responsible for its digital voice assistant and hardware products, including Fitbit wearable devices and Pixel smartphones. The reorganization of the hardware teams will see a consolidation of different teams responsible for different devices, such as Nest, Pixel, and Fitbit, combined under a single team, which will be responsible for all devices, the news portal reported, adding that the activity has also seen the departure of Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman.

Title: 'New toys' are back on the menu at Apollo as it looks to M&A to grow
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/apollo-marc-rowan-acquisition-plans-argo-lending-4q-earnings-call-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:11:18Z

One of Marc Rowan's favorite refrains as CEO of Apollo has been "no new toys." So central has been this philosophy of focusing on execution instead of growing through M&A or new initiatives that it was the theme of the firm's 2023 holiday video. That time has now passed, Rowan suggested on the firm's 2024 year-end earnings call. Pointing to the firm's acquisition last month of Argo Infrastructure Partners, a $6 billion assets-under-management firm with a track record of infrastructure investments, Rowan said the firm plans to acquire companies that stand to help expand Apollo's lending capabilities. "You should expect us to continue to do modest M&A along the same lines where we are quite focused on increasing our capacity to originate," Rowan said. Rowan's comments come amid a brightening picture for deals across the economy, stirred by the perception of a more business-friendly federal government and improving economic picture. At the end of last year, Apollo rolled out a five-year plan to double its private credit assets under management to $1.2 trillion. Rowan took care to say that the firm's dealmaking ambitions are "modest." He pointed to BlackRock's 2024 acquisitions in private credit and other alternative asset managers as an example of a broader convergence of public and private markets — a key Apollo theme. BlackRock plans to buy private-credit firm HPS Investment Partners and private-market data platform Preqin for $12 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and has already purchased investors Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. Apollo's acquisitions, by contrast, will be "small-scale" said Rowan, saying they will help the firm create more products for large public asset managers, like BlackRock, to access the private markets. Apollo's private credit ambitions have so far been fueled by its insurance arm, Athene, with Apollo using Athene's balance sheet to fund its lending needs. When asked about the possibility that some large insurance assets may soon come up for sale, Rowan responded by saying the firm isn't going to just grow for growth's sake. "For us, growth is not just about growing the assets," Rowan said, adding that the firm already had to capital to lend a record $70 billion-plus last year. Instead, the firm wants to grow where it can lend, with Argo as a "prototype." "We are focused on expanding capabilities that can be immediately accretive buying something that in and of itself does not fit with our franchise," Rowan said. Apollo now has access to more than 20 individuals with experience investing in infrastructure, and those individuals now have much more capital to tap into and many more ways to invest. Jump to

Title: NVO CLASS ACTION ALERT: BFA Law Alerts Novo Nordisk Investors that the Company has been Sued for Fraud – Contact BFA Law by March 25 Class Action Deadline (NYSE:NVO)

February 04, 2025 13:09 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Low Risk High Growth Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stands against the other low risk high growth stocks. In the past few days, the reintroduction of tariffs by the US government has been a significant factor influencing market dynamics. A 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% levy on Chinese imports, has heightened concerns about potential trade wars. These measures have led to increased market volatility, as investors assess the implications for global supply chains and corporate earnings. According to a report by news agency Reuters, based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure to US equities, marking the fifth consecutive week of net selling. This trend indicates a defensive posture, with funds anticipating potential economic slowdowns resulting from the new tariffs. Conversely, retail investors have shown resilience, injecting significant capital into the market, possibly betting on a resolution to trade tensions. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, another report by Reuters, based on a survey carried out by investment bank Barclays, reveals that investors are shifting away from traditional hedge fund strategies that rely on broad market movements due to concerns over market volatility in 2025. The Barclays survey of 325 hedge fund investors managing nearly $9 trillion found they want hedge funds to reduce beta exposure to as low as 5% or even zero. The report highlights that traditional hedge fund approaches like long/short stock picking, credit, and activism are losing favor. Instead, investors prefer funds using algorithmic trading and merger-arbitrage strategies. Multi-manager hedge funds, which operate multiple trading strategies under one firm, are now in high demand, returning 56% of investment share in 2024. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. To compile our list of the best low risk, high growth stocks, we made a list of firms with a beta of less than 1 and positive earnings per share growth over the past five years. The companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors during Q3 2024 were picked as the best low risk, high growth stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A corporate finance professional studying a financial performance chart. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) provides wealth management and other financial services. On January 21, the company reported net income for the fourth quarter totaling $1.8 billion, or $.94 earnings per share, excluding $177 million of pre-tax transaction-related and restructuring costs. Adjusted net income and earnings per share equaled $2 billion and $1.01, respectively. On January 13, the company announced the launch of the Schwab Core Bond ETF. It is the business’s second actively managed fixed-income ETF after the launch in August 2024 of the Schwab Ultra-Short Income ETF, which would provide investors with access to the company’s portfolio management team’s expertise, along with the inherent features of an ETF. Overall SCHW ranks 3rd on our list of the best low risk high growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SCHW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Why CFOs Need To Control Prices In A Disrupted Economy

Plus: Two In Five Executives Feel Unprepared For Market Shocks, Interest Rates Hold Steady For Now, Trump Creates A U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund, Unions Score Wins While The NRLB Gets A Loss The whipsawing news about tariffs and trade wars during the last few days has caused confusion, quick calculations and frantic negotiations between global business partners. However, according to BCG’s most recent Executive Perspectives study, 85% of businesses have been preparing for this eventuality since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, and more than 60% of executives have increased concerns about tariffs. Does that mean they’re ready for all that’s been going on? Not exactly. The study found that two in five executives feel unprepared for this latest round of market shocks, despite the previous five years characterized by market shocks: the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and high inflation. The balance of executives’ outlook toward market stability has also shifted this year. In North America, just 29% are optimists—a drop of 6% from 2024—while 19% are pessimists—an increase of 4% from last year. Business leaders’ financial mettle has been tested vigorously over the last few days with a raft of announcements about tariffs. On Friday, President Trump said he was enacting his first set of tariffs, which were to go into effect today: 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. Global markets dropped, and leaders went into negotiating mode. By the end of the day Monday, tariffs on Mexico and Canada were postponed for 30 days—Mexico promised to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to prevent drug trafficking, and Canada is spending $1.3 billion on a joint task force designed to combat fentanyl, organized crime and money laundering. China’s tariffs are beginning as planned, with the Asian nation placing retaliatory 15% tariffs on several American-made goods, as well as U.S. companies. This type of news is difficult to keep up with, let alone use to forecast your business plans. And while many companies prepared for potential tariffs on China last year, steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada weren’t in many companies’ viewfinders. Forbes senior contributor Michael Lynch writes that how Trump appears to be using tariffs so far—as a threat unless other countries do something the United States wants—makes it especially difficult for U.S. businesses. The tariffs are largely unrelated to business outcomes. Even without the open question of tariffs, the U.S. economy is in a volatile situation right now, as quick decisions have far reverberations. Stephan Liozu, chief value officer at financial software company Zilliant, says that companies can do much better if CFOs have a handle on pricing and can make quick changes to respond to the larger economic situation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks after last week's Open Market Committee meeting. The seesawing news on tariffs rocked the markets this week. In the U.S., all markets fell on Monday morning, but recovered slightly after Trump announced the pause on Mexico’s tariffs. However, the three major indexes closed down—the Dow down 0.3%, the S&P lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq minus 1.2%. The pause on Canada’s tariffs was announced after markets closed on Monday, and stocks slowly moved toward a recovery. But tariffs are far from the only decision of the last week that’s shaped the economic picture. Last week the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. It was the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. But Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore notes that tariffs tend to be paid for by consumers and U.S. companies in terms of higher prices, potentially increasing inflation—and therefore lowering the chances of additional rate cuts. Inflation and economic stagnation are persisting. Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December. GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. President Donald Trump, between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at left and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. New policy choices are also potentially reshaping the U.S.’s financial picture. On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. sovereign wealth fund—a state-owned fund that can invest in stocks, real estate, bonds, hedge funds and more that can insulate the government from economic stress. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it would be set up in the next 12 months, though it’s unclear where the money will come from. Trump said that perhaps TikTok could be put into this sovereign fund “if we make the right deal.” In his first week in office, Trump signed an order to create a working group on cryptocurrency, potentially creating a national digital asset stockpile, wrote Forbes senior contributor Jason Brett. Trump has been interested in cryptocurrency throughout his campaign, with his family creating the World Liberty Financial crypto venture last year, and $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins issued right before the inauguration. Former Forbes staffer Steven Ehrlich talked to former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Timothy Massad about Trump’s crypto ventures. Massad said it’s good that the administration is focusing on digital assets and is hopeful it will lead to a framework encouraging responsible development of the tech, but he sees no need for a strategic crypto reserve. A Costco Wholesale store in Chicago. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu. From the looks of it, price management software Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu believes we’re entering a period of hyperinflation, with costs going up and down all the time. For companies to perform better in times like this, he said CFOs need to have a better handle on and control of pricing—something that four in five companies don’t have a team dedicated to looking at. I talked to him about how companies should look at prices and plan for an uncertain future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How should prices be set? Liozu: I recommend the three Cs of pricing. You have to know your cost inside and out, and now the cost is changing on a minute[-by-minute] basis. That’s very dynamic and includes goods coming from outside, inside. The second C is competition. You need to anticipate what your competitors are going to do. How are we going to manage that hybrid inflation and tariffs? Are we going to do it better than you? Are they going to raise or decrease prices, et cetera? Then you have customer value. Right now, the perceptions of value are changing, and that means that you need to be aware that they might consider your offers, your product or services differently. The three Cs are in play constantly, and these three Cs are informing smart pricing decisions. Unfortunately, most companies will look at cost only, especially in periods of stagflation and inflation, but they need to really anticipate what competition is going to do and also the perceptions of value from consumers. What advice would you give to CFOs today that are trying to figure all this out? Number one is to take ownership of pricing. If no one is doing it and you don’t have a pricing team, create a task force, create a council and make sure you bring all these parties at the table, and say: OK, we’re going to do this better in a dynamic way, and with the right data. Number two is look at how pricing is managed, how long it takes you to do updates. Make a case for better investment in faster systems [for] optimization, automation. It pays for itself in six months when you look at money you save on not giving the right price to the market. Number three, I would say rethink your strategy with the three Cs. Most CFOs will go and focus on cost cutting, cost optimization and doing the calculations. Don’t forget competition and value because there is still a lot of value that can be captured from customers. There are a lot of strategies you could do in products and services to increase the value for the price. We’ve been in a period of disruption for a long time—the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East, and high inflation. But when things finally settle down again, do you think this focus on dynamic pricing will stay? Right now, disruption is the new constant. Based on how things are right now with China, Russia and trends around the world, we’re going to see ongoing disruption for the next 10 to 20 years.

February 04, 2025 12:01 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=126787&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

It encompasses people, processes, policies, standards, and roles that ensure the effective use of information. Data quality is a foundational aspect of data governance, ensuring that data is reliable, accurate, and fit for purpose. High-quality data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely, which is essential for informed decision-making. Additionally, well-defined policies and procedures play a crucial role in data governance. They provide clear guidelines for data management, ensuring that data is handled properly and complies with relevant regulations. Data Governance Pillars Data quality is the extent to which data meets a company's standards for accuracy, validity, completeness, and consistency. It is a crucial element of data management, ensuring that the information used for analysis, reporting, and decision-making is reliable and trustworthy. Data quality is crucial for several key reasons, and below are some of them: High-quality data supports more accurate and informed decision-making. Clean and reliable data helps streamline processes and reduce errors. Quality data leads to better products and services, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction. Poor data quality can result in significant financial losses. Adhering to data quality standards is essential for meeting regulatory requirements. The essential dimensions of data quality are described as follows: The following steps will assist in implementing data quality in the organization. By prioritizing data quality, organizations can unlock the full potential of their data assets and drive innovation. Data policies are the rules and guidelines that ensure how data is managed and used across the organization. They align with legal and regulatory requirements such as CCPA and GDPR and serve as the foundation for safeguarding data throughout its life cycle. Below are examples of key policies, including those specific to compliance frameworks like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Define rules to check the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data during extraction and transformation. Require adherence to data standards such as format, naming conventions, and mandatory fields. Mandate profiling and quality checks on source systems before data extraction to minimize errors. Define protocols for detecting, logging, and addressing data quality issues during ETL processes. Define role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict who can view or modify data during extraction and transformation processes. Require logging of all extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) activities to monitor and detect unauthorized changes. Mandate encryption for data in transit and during transformation to protect sensitive information. Define policies to ensure only necessary data is extracted and used for specific purposes, aligning with GDPR principles. Establish periodic profiling of data at rest to assess and maintain its quality. Define specific metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, completeness percentage, duplication rate) that data at rest must meet. For data in motion, implement policies requiring real-time validation of data against predefined quality thresholds. Define levels of sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential, Restricted) and the required protections for each category. Ensure periodic backups and the use of secure storage locations with restricted access. Establish secure processes for generating, distributing, and storing encryption keys. Align with GDPR Article 5(1)(d), which requires that personal data be accurate and up-to-date. Define periodic reviews and mechanisms to correct inaccuracies. Under CCPA, ensure that data provided to consumers upon request is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Require quality validation of data before deletion or anonymization to ensure compliance. Define procedures to allow users to access, correct, or delete their data upon request. Require vendors to comply with CCPA and GDPR standards when handling organizational data. Align with legal requirements to retain data only as long as necessary and securely delete it after the retention period. Key aspects of data policies include: Clear and enforceable policies provide the foundation for accountability and help mitigate risks associated with data breaches or misuse. Procedures bring policies to life, and they are step-by-step instructions. They provide detailed instructions to ensure policies are effectively implemented and followed. Below are expanded examples of procedures for protecting data during extraction, transformation, storage, and transit, as well as for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data: Implement checklists to validate extracted data against quality metrics (e.g., no missing values, correct formats). Compare transformed data with expected outputs to identify errors. Automated tools are used to detect and correct quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, during transformation. Perform unit and system tests on ETL workflows to ensure data quality is maintained. Regularly review ETL logs and audit trails to detect anomalies or unauthorized activities. Use checksum or hash validation to ensure data integrity during extraction and transformation. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing ETL tools and systems. Create dashboards to visualize quality metrics for data at rest and in motion. Set alerts for anomalies such as sudden spikes in missing or duplicate records. Integrate validation rules into data streams to catch errors immediately during transmission. Schedule regular audits to evaluate and improve the quality of data stored in systems. Schedule periodic rotation of encryption keys to reduce the risk of compromise. Standardize the use of SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for moving files and ensure APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Separate sensitive data from non-sensitive data in storage systems to enhance security. Before responding to consumer requests under CCPA or GDPR, validate the quality of the data to ensure it is accurate and complete. Implement error-handling procedures to address any discrepancies in consumer data. Establish workflows for correcting inaccurate data identified during regular reviews or consumer requests. Before data is deleted or retained for compliance, quality checks are performed to confirm its integrity and relevance. Establish a ticketing system for processing data subject requests and verifying user identity before fulfilling the request. Define steps to notify regulators and affected individuals within the time frame mandated by GDPR (72 hours) and CCPA. Apply masking or tokenization techniques to de-identify personal data used in analytics. The following are the various generalized roles and their responsibilities in defining policies and procedures, which may vary depending on the size and policies of the organization. Data Governance Policy Makers A strategic decision-making body comprising senior executives and stakeholders from across the organization. Oversees the entire data governance initiative and ensures policies align with the organization’s strategic goals. Operationally manages the implementation of data governance policies and procedures. Serve as subject matter experts for specific datasets, ensuring data quality, compliance, and governance. Typically, business leaders or domain experts are responsible for specific datasets within their area of expertise. Ensure policies meet regulatory and contractual obligations. Provide technical expertise to secure and implement policies at a systems level. Act as end users of the data governance framework. Policies and procedures are periodically reviewed to accommodate evolving regulations, technologies, and business needs. By involving the right stakeholders and clearly defining roles and responsibilities, organizations can ensure their data governance policies and procedures are robust, enforceable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

Title: ROSEN, TRUSTED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – NVO
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/04/3020617/673/en/ROSEN-TRUSTED-INVESTOR-COUNSEL-Encourages-Novo-Nordisk-A-S-Investors-to-Secure-Counsel-Before-Important-Deadline-in-Securities-Class-Action-NVO.html

February 04, 2025 11:52 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Godrej Properties, India's largest residential developer, sees huge room to expand

Bengaluru: Godrej Properties Ltd will look at profitable growth, expansion through land acquisitions, and build scale through higher market share, said a top company executive. The Mumbai-based developer has achieved 71% of its 2024-25 sales guidance of ₹27,000 crore on the back of strong housing demand and sales. In FY24, the company clocked ₹22,500 crore of sales bookings, making it the highest selling developer. “We will meet the sales guidance in the fourth quarter, which is said to be the strongest quarter in real estate. We have a number of launches coming up in multiple cities including Hyderabad, Noida, Pune, Gurugram. There are also two luxury projects in Mumbai which will be launched,” Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairperson, Godrej Properties, said in an interview. On Tuesday, the company reported a 152.23% rise in net profit to ₹158.20 crore for the October-December quarter, compared to ₹62.72 crore a year earlier. Revenue jumped 193.2% to ₹968.88 crore during the same period. “We are the largest residential developer in the country today, but we have a modest single-digit market share in the property markets we operate in. In FY24, we just about touched 10% market share in NCR, which is possibly our largest market. So, there is huge room for growth for Godrej Properties,” Godrej said. The three-month period through December was the sixth consecutive quarter when Godrej Properties clocked over ₹5,000 crore in sales bookings, the company said, underlying the sectoral tailwinds for India's residential real estate sector. In FY25 so far, the company has added projects of future sales value of over ₹23,000 crore, surprassing its ₹20,000 crore annual guidance. In December, Godrej Properties raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC, Blackrock, and SBI Pension, through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. "This capital allows us to further increase the pace of growth. We need to continue executing well, keep acquiring land and launching projects, and have a stronger presence across the cities we are present in, to gain market share," Godrej said. Around 80-90% of its group housing projects will be focused on the key cities it operates in, which includes Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-National Capital Region, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Godrej Properties will opportunistically look at markets such as Kolkata and Ahmedabad. For plotted development projects, “we are happy to go to the top 20 or more cities”, Godrej said. After clocking around ₹73,000 crore of residential sales bookings in FY24, a milestone for India’s real estate sector, the top four publicly listed developers—Godrej Properties, DLF Ltd, Macrotech Developers Ltd and Prestige Group--are collectively targeting nearly ₹88,000 crore of sales in FY25.

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget issued a two-page memo directing all federal agencies to pause the disbursement of federal financial assistance, sowing confusion across the country regarding what portion of the trillions in congressionally-appropriated funds, which encompass SNAP benefits, rental assistance, and Pell grants, would be obstructed.1 2 3 4 5 Medicaid portals in all 50 states went offline without warning, and the New York attorney general led a 22-state legal challenge to the edict, which was duly rescinded by the Trump Administration.6 7 8 9 âI cannot promise you that everything is going to be OK,â wrote the National Labor Relation Boardâs acting general counsel in a note to staff four days after Trump brought the agencyâs operations to an effective halt by illegally ousting one of its Democratic members and vaporizing its quorum.10 11 12 13 Two commissioners were removed at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the body that protects American laborers from illegal discrimination in the workplace, which ordered its own employees, in what would represent a repudiation of their duty to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, to pause their adjudication of gender and sexuality-based complaints.14 15 16 17 Staffers at the Center for Disease Control and the Departments of Energy and Transportation were ordered to remove pronouns from their email signatures, and the 60-year old Equal Employment Opportunity rule was overturned, once again allowing federal contractors to engage in acts of discrimination against their workers.18 19 In an Office of Personnel Management email bearing the same subject line, âFork in the Road,â as the message sent to Twitter staff days after Elon Muskâs 2022 takeover of the social-media company, nearly all of the countryâs 2.3 million federal workers were offered a buyout and encouraged to go on vacation or find âhigher productivityâ jobs in the private sector; shortly thereafter, OPM staffers found themselves locked out of internal databases containing sensitive information on all government personnel.20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Dozens of senior Department of Education employees were placed on administrative leave, dozens of Department of Justice prosecutors involved in criminal cases related to the January 6 insurrection were fired, and more than 1,000 people at the Environmental Protection Agency received notices that they were at risk of âimmediate termination.â27 28 29 30 31 The Department of Agriculture ordered the removal of all mention of âclimate changeâ from its websites, the Defense Department elected to no longer recognize Black History Month, and a man at Quantico was photographed painting over a mural bearing the words Integrity, Cooperativeness, Stability, Diversity, Respect.32 33 34 Envoys from the Department of Government Efficiency, which lacks a congressional mandate and is thus legally not a federal department, sought and secured access to classified data in a Bureau of Fiscal Service system that disburses trillions in social security and tax refunds to millions of Americans each year as well as classified U.S. Agency for International Development intelligence briefings for which they lacked the required security clearances.35 36 37 The Acting Secretary of the Treasury stepped down in defeat and two senior USAID security officers, who had tried to physically prevent DOGE personnel from accessing the restricted material, were escorted out of the Ronald Reagan Building and suspended.38 39 40 âTime for it to die,â Musk tweeted of USAID, whose communications department was largely gutted shortly before its website went black.41 42 43 44 45 Billions in U.S. foreign aid were frozen overnight, with an exemption made for military assistance to Israel.46 âThese guys are terrible at everything,â tweeted a Senate Democrat regarding Trumpâs failure to deport as many immigrants as Joe Biden had in his first week in office, and House Democrats held an emergency Zoom meeting.47 48 Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, leading the premier of Nova Scotia to order the provinceâs liquor corporation to pull all 400 of its American alcohol products from its shelves, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to announce retaliatory tariffs on Floridian orange juice, the value of the Canadian dollar to tumble to levels not seen since 2003, and Canadian sports fans to readopt the Iraq War-era tradition of booing âThe Star-Spangled Bannerâ when it was played at NBA and NHL games throughout the weekend.49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 U.S. stock market futures plunged, Asian shares slumped, and wait times to take out gold bullion from the Bank of England octupled as a stockpile worth an estimated $82 billion was amassed in New York in anticipation of global trade war.57 58 59 60 âWe may have short term some little pain,â Trump acknowledged as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Vehicle Suppliers Association warned the White House of the supply chain upheaval threatened by the new duties, which stand to spike the price of cars, fuel, beer, and avocados.61 62 63 64 65 66 Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum, who initially rejected the allegation that her government maintained an âintolerable allianceâ with drug trafficking cartels, sent 10,000 troops to its northern border to intercept fentanyl trade, and Trudeau agreed to appoint a âfentanyl czar,â the two North American leaders later securing a one-month stay on the American tariff levy.67 68 69 Goods from China were slapped with an additional 10 percent in import duties, prompting the country to announce that it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization, whose ability to mediate international trade disputes was kneecapped when the first Trump Administration blocked appointments to its main adjudication body, all seven seats of which remain vacant.70 71 72 âThese sabotage actions will not be tolerated,â the Latvian defense minister said after a fourth data cable running under the Baltic Sea was damaged in what are suspected to be covert attacks, leading Norway to seize a Russian-crewed cargo ship.73 74 75 On the Mediterranean Sea, the treaty granting the Russian Navy a military perch at the port of Tartus was terminated by the new Syrian government, which also demanded that the Kremlin, which is allegedly providing refuge to ousted leader Bashar Assad, pay the country reparations and âaddress past mistakes.â76 77 The Panamanian president announced that his nation would step away from the Belt and Road Initiative as Trump renewed threats to reappropriate the countryâs eponymous canal, through which $270 billion in cargo is ferried each year.78 79 80 The Suez Canal Authority announced that peace had been restored to the Red Sea while Israel continued its assault on the West Bank.81

Salesforce is reportedly eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company, Bloomberg reported Monday (Feb. 3), citing unnamed sources. It wasn’t clear which divisions were affected by the layoffs, the report said. Salesforce, a provider of customer management software, had nearly 73,000 employees as of January 2024, when its previous fiscal year closed. Salesforce did not respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Tech companies have gotten used to routine job cuts following a surge of layoffs in early 2023, according to the report. Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have all announced cuts so far this year. Meanwhile, Salesforce has been hiring people for its new AI agent products, while also focusing on shoring up profit margins following pressure from activist investors in 2023, the report said. “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business,” Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said when asked about the company’s profit focus in December, per the report. “We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?’” Last month, Salesforce debuted a point-of-sale (POS) operating system built on generative AI. “We’re not here to complement the status quo — we’re here to replace it,” Salesforce Senior Vice President and General Manager for Retail Nitin Mangtani told PYMNTS after the launch. “Retailers need technology that doesn’t just power transactions but transforms the entire shopping experience from discovery to checkout. That’s what this GenAI-powered POS is built to do.” Businesses must respect today’s fluid consumer journeys, which cover both physical and digital touchpoints, he said. For example, a consumer might happen upon a product while watching a TikTok video, buy it online, and exchange it in-store. “Unified commerce is not just a buzzword,” Mangtani said. “It’s table stakes. The consumer journey today is so intertwined that attributing success to one channel is nearly impossible.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a notorious leftist, is cutting over 1,000 jobs as the company’s new fiscal year begins, even as it ramps up hiring for AI-focused sales positions. Bloomberg reports that San Francisco-based Salesforce has announced it will be eliminating more than 1,000 roles as part of a restructuring effort coinciding with the start of its new fiscal year. The job cuts come despite the company simultaneously embarking on a hiring spree for salespeople specializing in its new AI agent products. According to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the private nature of the information, the affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific divisions impacted by the layoffs have not been disclosed. As of January 2024, Salesforce boasted a workforce of nearly 73,000 employees. The move by Salesforce reflects a growing trend among technology companies to implement regular job reductions, following a significant wave of layoffs that swept the industry in early 2023. This year alone, tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have all taken steps to trim their corporate workforces. While Salesforce is cutting jobs in certain areas, the company is also actively expanding its sales team to promote its new AI agent products. This dual approach highlights the company’s focus on maintaining profitability and efficiency, a priority that has been emphasized since activist investors applied pressure in 2023. In a December event hosted by Barclays Plc, Salesforce’s Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham addressed the company’s commitment to balancing growth and profitability, stating, “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business. We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?'” Breitbart News previously reported that Salesforce CEO was one of the many Silicon Valley leaders to extend an olive branch to Donald Trump after his stunning election victory in November: The turnabout is particularly striking given the extreme leftist politics of some executives now meeting with or praising Trump. Salesforce CEO and hyperleftist Marc Benioff, who owns Time Magazine, posted on X celebrating “a time of great promise for our nation” after Time named Trump its “Person of the Year.” Read more at Bloomberg here.

Title: Dunnes substituted as defendant in case in place of Margaret Heffernan

Dunnes Stores boss Margaret Heffernan, has been removed as a defendant and replaced with a company name in High Court proceedings brought by a man who claims building work has interfered with his property in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Derek O’Shaughnessy, with an address at the Morning Star Hotel, Dublin, claims he owns the property at Redgate 1 and 2, Annaville Avenue. He has claimed Ms Heffernan and others interfered with his property rights including by the building of a car park for Dunnes. The alleged interference began, he says, when scaffolding was allegedly unlawfully erected around his Annaville Avenue property from June 25th-July 21st, 2022. [ Dunnes Stores chief executive seeks strike-out of man’s claims of property interferenceOpens in new window ] He also claims a scaffolding firm unlawfully evicted him from his residence with the aid of gardaí and that work on demolishing his former home was carried out without appropriate permission from the council. On Tuesday Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed Ms Heffernan’s name could be removed as a defendant in the case and substituted with Dunnes Stores Better Value Unlimited Company. He also agreed five named gardaí from Blackrock and Dundrum stations could be replaced as defendants by the Garda Commissioner. He claims the gardaí wrongfully assisted in evicting him from what was his home. Last month, Mr O’Shaughnessy was granted interim High Court orders preventing Thomas Corcoran, of scaffolding firm Blackhorse Scaffolding; Frank Curran, chief executive of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council; the five gardaí; and Ms Heffernan from interfering with his property. All defendants deny his claims. He had applied to Mr Justice Brian Cregan for the orders on an ex-parte basis, which meant only he was in court on that day. Mr O’Shaughnessy, who is representing himself before the court, returned before Mr Justice Cregan on Tuesday when he said he was “trying to get at the truth” in bringing proceedings. He said his home had been “bulldozed to a shell” and that Mr Corcoran, who is a scaffolder, was claiming ownership without any proof. Lawyers for Mr Curran, the gardaí and Ms Heffernan said Mr O’Shaughnessy had brought proceedings against the incorrect defendants and they were seeking that they be amended. Ms Heffernan’s counsel, Martin Hayden SC, said his client also wanted the entire case struck out against his client as the pleadings showed no cause of action. He also said his client had “no involvement, good, bad or indifferent with the property”. As well as agreeing to the change of name for Ms Heffernan and the gardaí, Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed that Mr Curran’s name as a defendant could be replaced with Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Co Council. The judge gave directions for exchange of affidavits between the defendants and Mr O’Shaughnessy and said the case could come back in March.

Title: Advanced Micro Devices Has High Growth Ahead With A Great Valuation

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary AMD (AMD, Financial) is one of the most exciting chip companies in the world at the moment. Due to its strategic focus on AI, including a diversified approach centered on inference as well as training demand, the stock has a robust medium-term future ahead of it. Moreover, my valuation model posits a 35% margin of safety for investment assessed from a full financial breakdown of its earnings capacity and share count over the next three years. Additionally, my December 2027 price target of $290 is the conclusive reason I am highly bullish on AMD stock at its present valuation. Operational & financial analysis In my opinion, there are two semiconductor companies that are both the best-positioned in terms of valuation, financials, and operations to warrant heavy buying of their stock at the moment. However, there is a core difference between the two companies that makes AMD a more stable medium-term investment. I’ve mentioned extensively in previous analyses on Nvidia that it is likely to face a revenue decline in the medium term related to lower spend on AI infrastructure graphics processing units for model training. However, AMD is focusing on inference workloads, a potentially larger and more protracted market. At the moment, AMD's data center segment accounts for about half of its total revenue and grew by 122% year-over-year in Q3 2024. However, Nvidia remains dominant with around a 90% share of the AI graphics processing unit market. Unlike training workloads that require high-end graphics processing units, inference can leverage central processing units, graphics processing units, and even specialized accelerators, providing AMD with multiple avenues to compete as it transitions its focus toward inference to differentiate itself from Nvidia. In addition, while Nvidia has a comprehensive software ecosystem named CUDA, this is more focused on training utilizing high-performance graphics processing units like the H100. Inference workloads will be less reliant on CUDA, so AMD has an opportunity to compete with its open-source ROCm stack and cost-efficient solutions. In the next two to three years, AMD is quite likely to achieve an earnings without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of over 35% due to profit harvesting amid the upcycle of its AI ramp up and other diversified revenue streams. Moreover, this will likely coincide with around a 20% compound annual growth rate in its revenues over the time period. Such growth forecasts are based on my research and analysis of its current growth trends and market position and validated against consensus estimates from Wall Street. To be precise, I forecast $44.5 billion in annual revenue for Fiscal 2027 (ending December 2027), and earnings without non-recurring items of $8.37 for Fiscal 2027. Valuation analysis For my valuation model, I provide a full breakdown of the company's profit potential and share issuance. The model is capped at three years, in-line with my estimates above due to this likely being the highest-growth period to hold AMD stock in the foreseeable future. The company's basic average shares outstanding have been increasing at an 8.23% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. If this trend slows due to profit harvesting meaning the company is less reliant on equity financing to fund its operations, a compound annual growth rate of 5% in its share count seems plausible over the next three years. The company's current trailing 12-month shares outstanding equals 1.62 billion, so I forecast it will have 1.88 billion trailing 12-month shares outstanding in December 2027. AMD Shares Outstanding Chart As I forecast that the company will have about a 35% trailing 12-month net margin without non-recurring items by December 2027, the company's net income without non-recurring items would be $15.75 billion. Given my forecast that it will have 1.88 billion shares outstanding, this equates to an earnings per share without non-recurring items of $8.37. AMD stock is currently trading at a much cheaper price-to-earning ratio without non-recurring items compared to its 10-year median of just over 50. The current multiple is almost 40. Moreover, this indication of good value is not just due to cyclical profitability dynamics as the company's price-to-sales ratio of nearly 8 is only moderately higher than its 10-year median of 5.45, despite a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.9% compared to 2.5% as a 10-year median. I therefore consider AMD very reasonably valued right now. Indeed, a terminal multiple of 35 appears both consistent with historical valuations, industry norms (i.e. compared to Nvidia), and conservative given its robust growth horizon with no indication of a medium-term revenue decline for now. AMD and Nvidia PS Ratio Chart The result of my model is a fair December 2027 price target for AMD stock of $290, indicating approximately a three-year compound annual growth rate of over 35%. AMD's weighted average cost of capital is 16.83%, composed of 98.6% equity (costing 17.02%) and 1.4% debt (costing 3.75% pre-tax, 3.75% post-tax due to a 0% effective tax rate). When discounting my December 2027 price target back to the present day over three years using the company's weighted average cost of capital as my discount rate, the implied intrinsic value is $180. As the stock is currently trading at $115, the implied margin of safety in my model is 35%. Risk analysis AMD is not the only company competing in the inference market and attempting to disrupt Nvidia's moat in AI infrastructure. Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) and Marvell (MRVL, Financial) are aggressively entering the AI accelerator market, with Broadcom showing particular promise with potentially $90 billion in AI-related revenue over the next three years. Moreover, there are niche players like Cerebras and Groq which are poised to dominate portions of use-case specific inference through targeting lower latency and higher throughput with tailored chips. It is also worth considering that though we have Trump in the White House this year for a four year term, likely providing more geopolitical resilience through stronger leadership, tensions between the East and West are still high, especially surrounding Taiwan. If further hot wars break out or trade tensions escalate, supply chains and revenue streams could be disrupted. In a worst-case scenario of a market crash, I believe it prudent for investors to have a robust cash position at this time to mitigate risk and allow themselves to capitalize shrewdly on any major undervaluations that occur. This is the strategy being adopted by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), and it appears a shrewd model to emulate. The greatest risk operationally and financially is that AMD has recently heavily concentrated its resources on AI. I do not consider this a bad thing, given that the AI industry is the highest-growth economic boom most people know of. However, it comes with risks for AMD shareholders if the company falls short of expectations. This could manifest if there is lumpiness in AI spending as enterprises optimize their budgets after initial build-outs, or if customers encounter any errors with its central processing units, graphics processing units, or AI accelerators, as two key examples. Conclusion I currently have a significant portion of my value trading portfolio in Nvidia shares, and I'm considering adding AMD shares at a higher or equal weight. I expect I will hold my AMD shares for longer than my Nvidia shares, because Nvidia is showing signs of significantly slower growth on the horizon and then, very likely, at least a minor revenue contraction. Therefore, I am only planning on holding Nvidia stock for about a year, but will likely hold my AMD position for two years or more. As my valuation model indicates, holding AMD stock for three years could result in a 35% compound annual growth rate, making it a top investment to consider at this time. One Community. Many Voices.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) evolved from simple claims processors into powerful health care intermediaries that control drug pricing and access through their relationships with insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. PBMs engage in “spread pricing” — charging insurers more than they reimburse pharmacies and pocketing the difference — while also steering patients toward higher-cost medications through “rebate pumping” arrangements with drug manufacturers The current health care system, influenced by PBMs, underemphasizes preventive care while promoting long-term drug dependency, as ongoing prescription management generates more reliable revenue than prevention or cures Independent pharmacies and rural hospitals struggle financially under PBM practices, facing delayed reimbursements, strict audit requirements, and complex negotiation terms that often force them to either close or sell to larger chains Three major investment firms — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (the “Big Three”) — have significant financial stakes across PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance companies, creating a web of interconnected financial interests Solutions include eliminating safe harbor rebate rules, expanding cash-pay health care models, separating PBM services from insurance companies, and implementing stricter regulations to improve pricing transparency * In the featured video, independent journalist Tucker Carlson interviews Brigham Buhler — founder and CEO of Ways2Well, a preventative care and health optimization platform — about how the health insurance industry works to keep us in poor health. Buhler’s career in health care spans over 25 years, during which he gained significant insights into the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The rising cost of health care in the United States has become a heavy burden for many families who struggle to pay for essential services. Patients often end up navigating a maze of insurance requirements, denials, and opaque billing practices without understanding why their treatments cost so much. Pharmaceutical prices add another layer of difficulty, with insurers and other entities setting guidelines that determine access. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, occupy a powerful place in this ecosystem. Initially created to simplify payments and negotiate prices, they have grown into influential brokers controlling which drugs are covered and how they are priced. Critics argue that these corporations operate behind the scenes, orchestrating deals that maximize their profits while pushing more expenses onto patients. In other words, PBMs engage in hidden collaborations and pricing manipulations that fuel a system that is more concerned with corporate gain than with patient well-being. By shedding light on the complex financial incentives at play, Buhler helps us understand why each step of seeking medical care — from preventive screenings to essential prescriptions — feels increasingly draining on both wallets and morale. He reveals an elaborate structure where individuals are funneled into long-term drug usage while basic preventative care is overlooked. Instead of ensuring affordability, PBMs exploit hidden markups and secret rebates to inflate insurance bills and keep people locked in chronic illness. For decades, researchers have warned that chronic disease often begins with lifestyle factors. A diet loaded with chemicals, refined sugars, and addictive formulas paves the way for obesity, metabolic issues, and diabetes. The logical solution would be preventive care, yet the system consistently underfunds or blocks such efforts. Instead, the patient, already in poor health, is nudged into a cycle of drugs. In short, insurance companies profit from setting premiums and reimbursements that don’t address the root causes. PBMs connect drug manufacturers with insurance plans and pharmacies. By deciding which medications get favorable placement on insurance formularies, they have substantial power to shape treatment pathways. They operate as the “middlemen,” determining reimbursement rates and adding costs that might not be obvious to consumers. Critics argue that each link in this chain — from the chemistry of our fast-food culture to the mechanics of corporate insurance contracts — feeds long-term drug dependency. People hope doctors will rescue them with thoughtful interventions, yet many find themselves steered into prescriptions rather than genuine solutions. The net effect is a growing population locked into care that does little to uproot their actual problems. Pharmacy Benefit Managers began as logistical helpers for insurance claims, intended to ease administrative burdens and secure group discounts on medications. In those early days, patients often benefited from lower prices and streamlined services, confident that PBMs were working on their behalf to rein in drug spending. Over time, PBMs took a more pivotal role by merging with major insurers, pharmacies, and even drug companies. This expansion gave them the power to decide which medications appear on covered lists and how high co-pays would be set. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, often called the “Big Three,” poured investments into many PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance firms, linking them financially. Regulatory agencies did little to keep up. Safe harbor laws, originally designed to allow certain discount arrangements, opened a door to hidden deals that few outsiders could track. Even government officials sometimes admit that they lack the tools or data to parse how PBMs arrive at final medication costs or distributions. This vacuum fosters multiple avenues for manipulative pricing. While PBMs publicly champion themselves as experts in cost reduction, many inside observers contend that the real focus is leveraging secret rebates and inflated prices. The result is an enigma for consumers and health providers, who see rising expenses but cannot pinpoint exactly where the money goes. Without greater transparency, the underlying profit mechanisms of PBMs remain locked away behind bureaucratic layers. A key accusation involves “spread” pricing, where PBMs charge insurers a higher rate than they reimburse pharmacies, quietly pocketing the difference. Though advertised as normal operations, this method can inflate costs at every transaction. One high-profile investigation in Ohio’s Medicaid system revealed how drastically these discrepancies boosted PBM revenues, convincing state officials that alternative approaches were more cost-effective. A second alleged tactic is “rebate pumping.” PBMs decide which drugs get priority coverage, sometimes favoring those with generous rebates from manufacturers. While patients believe they are following insurance rules, they might be guided toward medications that offer bigger profits for the PBM, even if more affordable or clinically superior options exist. This hidden arrangement undermines genuine market competition. Formulary manipulation can steer entire populations toward high-cost drugs. When PBMs place lower-cost medications in less accessible tiers or require complicated approvals, patients rarely realize they’ve been nudged into pricier choices. Over time, these directed behaviors funnel billions into the PBM’s revenue stream. Smaller drug makers, unable to provide large rebates, struggle to compete. There is also the “deny, delay, depose” approach: denying coverage, delaying approvals, and deposing providers to wear down patients who challenge any claim refusal. The bureaucracy can be exhausting, compelling many people to simply accept PBM-dictated medications or give up on certain procedures. On top of this, forced mail-order mandates reduce local pharmacy competition. Large PBMs often own chain pharmacies or mail services, ensuring yet another revenue channel. By dictating that some prescriptions must be filled through a mail-order affiliate, they tighten their hold on supply routes. Collectively, all of these maneuvers burden the sick while generating steady corporate windfalls. Small, independent pharmacies are the first to feel the weight of these arrangements. They operate on narrow margins, often waiting extended periods for reimbursement. Regular audits can penalize them if co-pays or deductibles aren’t strictly collected. Many find the financial strain overwhelming and convert to cash-only practices or sell to bigger chains aligned with PBMs. Hospitals, especially those in rural or underserved areas, also struggle. Heavy dependence on insurer contracts means they must accept the terms PBMs set, even if that means late or partial payments. The complexity of negotiations can leave hospitals uncertain of actual reimbursement amounts for surgeries and treatments. Over time, these uncertainties hamper hiring efforts, infrastructure updates, and overall quality of care. Patients shoulder the brunt of it. Co-pays and deductibles, often determined by PBMs in tandem with insurance companies, can skyrocket. A single major procedure might leave someone battling endless paperwork, fighting denials, or searching for a distant “in-network” specialist. Over time, chronic disease management grows more expensive, sometimes to the point where even standard treatments become a risky financial gamble. Though high costs might be justified as byproducts of progress, critics point out that patients who need life-extending therapies can be denied based on invisible profit motivations. These denials or lengthy pre-authorization demands can dangerously delay critical interventions. Overall, the system keeps many people in a perpetual state of fear, worried about the next surprise bill or approval hurdle. The troubling notion is that PBMs profit when people remain in long-term treatment. Managing diabetes, heart disease, or recurring infections, for example, yields continual revenue from drug sales, hospital stays, and follow-up visits. If earlier screenings or lifestyle guidance could prevent these conditions, insurers and PBMs would lose a recurring income stream. Thus, the system subtly discourages prevention. Preventive care often gets labeled as “non-essential.” Insurance companies may only cover minimal checkups or simplified blood panels rather than the deep investigative screenings that might detect cancer cells or metabolic shifts. Doctors who push for thorough evaluations can face audits or claim denials. This approach effectively steers clinicians away from digging into root causes and keeps them dispensing short-term fixes instead. Chemotherapy, obesity medications, and specialized therapies offer further insight. PBMs choose which oncology drugs or weight-loss injections land on the top tier of coverage, frequently guided by favorable rebate structures. For instance, prescribing an expensive cancer drug is more attractive to PBMs than promoting cost-effective solutions or advanced screenings. By focusing on maximum reimbursement rather than clinical optimization, PBMs foster a system that prizes medication adherence over true health. Even potential cures or preventative interventions fade in importance compared to the reliable flow of payments from chronic prescriptions. One of the biggest shields for PBMs lies in corporate media’s dependence on pharmaceutical advertising. Huge budgets flow from big pharma and PBMs into television networks, newspapers, and digital platforms. Investigative reporters who try to expose PBM tactics might find their stories curtailed. Advertisers dislike unfavorable coverage and influence editorial choices that help them maintain their revenue streams. Lobbying piles on another layer of insulation. PBMs, insurers, and drug manufacturers invest massively in shaping legislation. They aim to preserve safe harbor laws and defend the complexity of rebate arrangements. Officials, short on time and expertise, often accept industry talking points that claim PBMs deliver broad discounts. Meanwhile, advanced data remain hidden under confidentiality clauses, preventing thorough oversight. Alternative or cost-effective providers become immediate targets for negative coverage or red tape. Compounding pharmacies, which customize medications more cheaply, face extra scrutiny and high-profile condemnation if any recall occurs. At the same time, preventive clinics that promote advanced blood tests and deeper lifestyle assessments are dismissed as “non-traditional,” leading many patients to doubt their credibility. Without a major shift in how media and lobbying are handled, PBMs will likely continue operating in the shadows, benefiting from the current structure. Even well-intentioned legislators who propose reforms may confront a lobbying wall that distorts or dilutes their efforts. As long as the press echoes PBM-friendly narratives, the public remains unaware of the mechanics that inflate drug costs and stifle real medical innovation. Some argue that the fastest route to PBM accountability is legislative reform. Eliminating safe harbor rebate rules could force full disclosure of every cent collected from manufacturers. If the public saw how big the discrepancy was between list prices and actual reimbursements, the outcry might pressure policymakers to demand fairer pricing structures. Others propose expanding the cash-pay model so that pharmacies and clinics can sidestep PBM-dictated reimbursements. Direct primary care clinics, which ask for a monthly membership rather than rely on insurance, show promise. Patients pay transparent fees, sidestepping the labyrinth of co-pays, claim denials, and lengthy authorization steps. Critics say it may limit coverage for catastrophic events, but supporters argue it fosters clearer, more compassionate medical relationships. Another idea is to separate PBM services from insurance altogether. Insurers could be barred from owning or partnering with PBMs, avoiding the vertical integration that squeezes out independent competitors. If drug costs were set in an open marketplace, free from hidden rebates, local pharmacies might compete on actual prices, improving affordability for the average consumer. Finally, bold political will is essential. Some leaders talk about dismantling PBMs, a move that could reorder the entire pharmaceutical ecosystem. Opponents decry it as radical, but the current system is unsustainable. If enough people demand an end to covert backroom deals, PBMs could be dethroned from their gatekeeping position, placing health care decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients. The PBM conversation intersects with a larger reality: a culture of processed foods and tobacco-inspired marketing that has ravaged public health. By engineering addictive flavors and packaging, corporations profit from driving individuals toward chronic ailments like diabetes. PBMs then profit further from long-term prescription management. This chain of enticements traps many in endless cycles of medication. Preventive medicine would disrupt this pattern, but PBMs have little reason to champion comprehensive screenings. If fewer people develop metabolic disease, the volume of prescription-based revenue drops, undermining the financial base of PBM operations. In short, more robust screenings, especially for heart disease and early-stage cancer, would save lives but erode corporate balance sheets. The good news is that many patients are now starting to rebel and opt for things like direct-pay blood tests, customized diets, and health care providers who embrace functional principles — all of which weaken the PBM chokehold. By proactively caring for your body, you reduce the likelihood of becoming a chronic customer for expensive prescriptions. The goal, in essence, is to break the cycle that pairs hidden market incentives with manufactured disease. PBMs exert a profound influence on who gets what medication and at what cost, yet much of their work is veiled from public view. As explained by Buhler, this system, anchored in concealed rebates, inflated average wholesale prices, and manipulative formulary structures, is responsible for skyrocketing health care costs. Patients feel the sting through insurance premiums, high deductibles, and arbitrary claim denials. By peeling back the layers, we see a troubling alliance between PBMs, major insurers, and media outlets — a web that thrives on keeping Americans in long-term prescription cycles. Though reforms have been proposed, progress is stalled by extensive lobbying and carefully crafted narratives that depict PBMs as cost-saving heroes. Still, a rising movement demands real transparency and policy changes that might reset the playing field. Shifting the balance of power involves both political and individual actions. For example, we need to urge lawmakers to abolish secret rebate loopholes and consider stricter regulation of PBMs. On a personal level, you can also explore direct-pay health care models, improve your knowledge about preventive medicine, and support local pharmacies that sidestep the PBM structure. As noted in the featured interview, a failure to confront these issues leaves us with ever-increasing premiums, minimal improvements in chronic disease outcomes — and minimal trust in the institutions supposed to protect public health. But if genuine policy efforts and grassroots initiatives merge, we can begin to reclaim control. The prospects for cheaper drugs, renewed primary care, and a greater focus on prevention could then become more than just a distant hope. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing renewed selling pressure as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China lead to fresh tariffs on both sides. The largest cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $91,000 on Monday, while major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also faced losses. The most recent installment of tariffs comes after the US enacted a 10% tax on all items from China, leading China to respond with its own tariffs on certain US imports, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, starting February 10. In another development, China has launched an inquiry into Google LLC over supposed antitrust infringements, intensifying the tension between the two economic giants. This market turbulence has wiped out the benefits from a short relief rally on Monday, which occurred after the Trump administration decided to postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month. The weekend’s initial declaration of US tariffs had already triggered a steep drop in cryptocurrency prices. Investor trust in riskier assets has been notably affected, as US investors pulled a net $235 million from a set of 12 Bitcoin-centric exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday. Moreover, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Inc.’s derivatives market decreased by 4%, reflecting a more cautious attitude among institutional investors. President Donald Trump, recognized for his pro-crypto position, has unintentionally brought more uncertainty to digital asset markets. Although cryptocurrencies experienced a rise following Trump’s election, the market now faces a difficult landscape marked by geopolitical strife and regulatory obstacles. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,970, about 13% shy of its all-time high. Meanwhile, US ETFs investing in Ethereum witnessed record trading volumes on Monday, with significant liquidation of leveraged positions rattled by ongoing trade uncertainties. The iShares Ethereum Trust, led by BlackRock, accounted for nearly half of the $1.5 billion in trading volume among a group of nine ETFs. ETH plummeted by as much as 27% on Monday, leading to over $600 million in liquidations within perpetual futures markets, according to Bloomberg data. Analyzing current price trends, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,180 as a critical support level for Bitcoin, based on MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) pricing bands. If this support level fails, the next target could be $74,400. Despite the recent price correction, Bitcoin traders are still enjoying a profit margin of 3.36%. Historically, local bottoms have formed when profit margins drop below -12%, suggesting that Bitcoin could have further downside potential before reaching a true bottom. Additionally, the MVRV Momentum indicator has remained in negative territory since the beginning of the year, signaling ongoing market weakness.

Title: Across Disciplines: Frameworks For Investment Thinking
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevendesmyter/2025/02/04/across-disciplines-frameworks-for-investment-thinking/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T15:07:02Z

Behavioural Economics... There was an interesting back and forth on X the other day in which U.S. academics debated the “seriousness” of economics as a discipline. It got me thinking about an idea that I’d been turning over for some time: the different faces of investment theory, the sense of the markets as a sphere that requires both art and science to comprehend it, where “merely” immersing yourself in the academic literature isn’t enough. I recognize how much of the way I think about investment is predicated on mental models and frameworks drawn from other disciplines. Occam’s Razor, for instance, or the Overton Window, or feedback loops. Back to the academic mini-controversy on X. Ben Golub, of Northwestern, pointed out that economics is a subject almost unique among the social sciences in the way it doesn’t demand that its practitioners are versed in the subject’s academic history. History vs Economics Another way of phrasing this is that, unlike other disciplines — history, for instance — economics as it is studied today has evolved dramatically, even unrecognizably over the past years and decades. It isn’t all that useful – one might argue – for today’s economists to spend their time reading Adam Smith, rooted as he was in the economic realities of the 18th century, a place of manual labour and nascent industrialization, just as you would not judge a geneticist for not knowing Mendel inside out. But you would, of course, raise an eyebrow if a literature student hadn’t read Shakespeare. For more on this subject, do read the always-brilliant Noah Smith on Noahpinion. Economics looks forward, rather than backward. As a discipline it is trapped between science and humanities, neither rigorously empirical enough for the former, nor interpretive or judgmental enough for the latter. A similar narrative might be forged around the art/science of investing. To some — my chartist friends — it is a science, reducible to a series of measurable and predictable patterns: inflection points, moving averages and momentum indicators. Chartists To behavioral economists, markets are closer to the humanities, a reflection of unnumbered human dramas playing out across the world: fear and greed, panic and exuberance. Behavioural Thinking To me, the markets are not about one thing, but about everything. To understand the movement of financial assets, you have to be an expert in geopolitics and history, sociology and mathematics, literature and anthropology. The markets to my mind are two seemingly paradoxical things at once: both machines governed by hard rules and also a narrative space where subjective forces express themselves. This is why for our MAIS Conference at University of Oxford each year, we seek to bring the best minds from across a wide range of different disciplines: not just markets, but the world. I've written before about the benefits of adjacent thinking here: The Age Of Adjacency And Moneyball Finance. Markets are stories we tell ourselves about the future. They are where numbers meet narrative, where abstraction collides with reality. But the tools we use to understand them — DCF models, CAPE ratios, technical indicators — are often blunt instruments for something so intricate. These tools assume that markets are systems of data, when they are in fact just as much systems of meaning. To see markets clearly, then, we must think like outsiders. We must raid the treasuries of other disciplines — philosophy, physics, literature, biology — for frameworks that they use to address the world. What can we learn from fields that have long grappled with complexity, ambiguity and the unpredictability of human behavior? Let’s start with science. In physics, a phase transition occurs when a system undergoes a dramatic transformation after crossing a critical threshold — water boiling, for instance, or ice melting. The system behaves predictably until it doesn’t, shifting suddenly into a new state. Markets, too, operate in phases: periods of calm punctuated by moments of chaos. But here’s the crucial insight: Phase transitions don’t happen randomly. They are driven by the accumulation of stress, the hidden build-up of fragility. The 2008 financial crisis wasn’t a black swan event; it was the boiling point of a system under strain, where leverage and opacity had quietly created the conditions for collapse. The physics of phase transitions tells us to look not at the event itself, but at the system’s thresholds. What are the hidden forces — illiquidity, concentrated leverage, shadow banking - that might suddenly tip the markets into a new state? In biology, ecosystems are governed by cycles: predator and prey, bloom and collapse. These cycles are not symmetrical or perfectly timed; they are messy, adaptive, and shaped by feedback loops. Markets, too, are evolutionary systems, where cycles of greed and fear drive growth and collapse. The biological model reminds us to look for meta-cycles - the evolution of cycles themselves. What happens, for instance, when AI begins to dominate trading strategies? Will it create new feedback loops that amplify volatility or reduce it? By thinking biologically, we stop looking at markets as static systems and start seeing them as adaptive environments, constantly reshaped by innovation and behavior. What about the study of literature? I tend always to have both a novel and a nonfiction book on the go at once: I feel like I learn as much from the former as the latter. Literary theorists often talk about the “intentional fallacy,” the idea that an author’s intent doesn’t fully determine the meaning of a text. Markets, similarly, resist simple interpretation. A stock price is a sentence in a larger story — a fragment of collective sentiment that means different things to different participants. Think of the rise of Tesla. To a traditional analyst, it might have seemed wildly overvalued for years, defying every fundamental metric. But Tesla wasn’t just a car company; it was a story about innovation, the climate crisis, and Elon Musk’s cult of personality. Its price was the fiction that investors told themselves about the future - a narrative so compelling it bent reality to its will, drawing capital that made the vision possible. What can literature teach us here? One lesson is that stories don’t have to be “true” to be powerful. Another is that markets, like novels, follow narrative arcs: euphoria, climax, disillusionment. Investors who can read markets as fiction - understanding not just the numbers but the underlying sentiment driving them - gain an edge in anticipating how the story might evolve. What emerges when we steal tools from physics, literature, biology, and elsewhere isn’t just a better way of thinking about markets — it’s a redefinition of investing itself. Markets aren’t machines to be mastered; they’re (super)human systems to be understood. They are, like ecosystems or novels, complex and adaptive, driven as much by psychology and sentiment as by fundamentals. The best investors already operate at this level. They understand that valuation models are necessary but insufficient, that no amount of data can fully explain the alchemy of collective behavior. They know that their edge comes not from predicting the future, but from interpreting the present, seeing patterns, thresholds, and narratives that others overlook. This isn’t an easy way to think. It requires humility, curiosity and the willingness to be wrong. But for those willing to think beyond the traditional tools of finance, the rewards of this cross disciplinary approach to investment are profound: a clearer understanding of the markets and the human impulses that drive them.

[+] front of a flag of China (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) Here’s my take on the DeepSeek selloff we saw last week: It’s a buying opportunity, especially for income investors. (I wrote a bit about this in last Thursday’s article. Since the market has rebounded a bit since, we’re going to talk about it more today. A preview? It’s not too late to buy the dip.) Why do income investors hold an edge here? Because they have a chance to buy Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI stocks, including some private-equity firms few people have access to, through closed-end funds. Tapping the selloff this way gives us two key benefits: The two funds in question—the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ) are the two funds we’re focusing on here. They work well when bought as a pair because they have different mandates: BST focuses more on the big caps of the tech world, holding stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. BSTZ holds some of those, as well, but also has smaller companies and private-equity firms focused on growth. That lends itself to more upside, but also more volatility—something BST, with its larger cap focus, helps us address. To really get at the opportunity we’re looking to tap into here, let’s talk a bit more about DeepSeek and what it means for AI and the tech sector more generally. Essentially, DeepSeek, which originated in China, was allegedly developed and trained for only $6 million. It’s now being offered as an open-source model essentially for free. With a cost of $0 for this AI tech, the reasoning goes, there’s no reason to spend billions on AI from companies like OpenAI or others whose stocks soared on the tech last year. Those include Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, all of which tanked on Monday, with NVIDIA, maker of the chips that underpin AI, falling 17%. Then, on Tuesday, the market erased much of its losses. Nvidia has more room to recover, though there could be short-term choppiness as investors debate what all this means. So, what should we make of this whole situation? Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that AI is critical to the stock market, and even a whiff of things going amiss could cause a reflexive selloff. The word “reflexive” here is key, because the selloff really didn’t make much sense. Free AI tools lower capital expenditure from businesses paying AI providers like OpenAI. That’s obviously bad for OpenAI and possibly Microsoft, which has invested almost $14 billion into OpenAI. Of course, that $14 billion is less than one-half of one percent of Microsoft’s market cap, so it’s really not that big of a blow. Maybe it’s bad for Alphabet? That doesn’t make much sense, either, as Alphabet has been giving away many of its AI tools to ensure people keep using Google services, like search. So it isn’t really a direct competitor to DeepSeek. And Nvidia? That stock’s selloff was the most egregious, and not because it was the biggest. Thing is, free AI tools mean people will use more AI. And since lower prices increase demand for a product, the more AI demand there is, the more demand there will be for Nvidia chips in the long run. DeepSeek’s new chatbot should’ve caused Nvidia shares to rise, not fall. Still, these stocks fell because this was a new story, and new stories create fear, which causes panic selling. Which is why we saw investors buy Nvidia shortly after. It’s not too late to join them—and as mentioned, BST and BSTZ are great avenues to take here. Especially when, in the case of Nvidia, we were in this same situation just six months ago. Back in July 2024, fears that both then-President Joe Biden and Donald Trump would impose controls on Nvidia selling chips to China caused the stock to fall 12% that month, with almost all of the drop coming in a little more than a week (shown below). July Tech Dip Other big tech names—like Alphabet (in orange) and Microsoft (in blue), as well as the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF (VGT), a reasonable proxy (in purple)—were dragged down alongside NVIDIA. Anyone who bought that dip did well, as all of these stocks have recovered since, and helped drive tech (again measured by VGT, in purple) to outperform the S&P 500, even after last week’s selloff. Tech Rallies That’s likely why some investors pounced on the DeepSeek–driven selloff. Which brings us back to BST and BSTZ, and the opportunity they give us to “lock in” a selloff that hasn’t yet fully recovered. Post-selloff, both BST and BSTZ now trade at unusually large discounts to net asset value (5.4% for BST and 10.2% for BSTZ). And those discounts are near their widest since the last tech selloff six months ago. So not only are we getting NVIDIA (the largest holding in both of these funds) at a discount thanks to the selloff, but we’re buying these funds when their own discounts are particularly wide. We can see by comparing the tech sector’s performance to BSTZ’s since its discount widened to 12% in August 2024 to now, even after the recent selloff. BSTZ Outperforms BST? Similarly, buying BST when its discount widened to its largest point in mid-August last year and holding to the time I’m writing this also resulted in outperformance, although a tad less than BSTZ’s, since BST focuses more on large caps. And the kicker: Buying these funds and holding while waiting for similar outperformance gets us an 8% yield with BST and 12.7% from BSTZ, for that 10.4% average payout. It goes to show that buying oversold CEFs, collecting their dividends as they recover, then selling when the market fully rebounds is a proven way to build your net worth while maximizing your income and diversifying, too.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin Reserve May Be Coming, But States Are Winning the Race

Almost half of the state governments in the U.S. are either on a path toward putting some of their money into crypto or already have, and much of a suddenly booming interest in tying their financial futures to the digital-assets markets has come after U.S. President Donald Trump showed support for a national stockpile of digit assets. In the surge of crypto legislative or financial efforts at the state level, 21 states are investing or looking into investing — generally in the industry's leading token, bitcoin (BTC), and sometimes also in less volatile stablecoins that are designed to match the value of the U.S. dollar, according to a CoinDesk analysis. With states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania, Utah and Texas already digging into legislation to open public funds to buy cryptocurrencies, such initiatives may outpace the effort in Congress targeting a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Sixteen state legislatures are looking at bills to either establish digital assets stockpiles or to allow their state retirement funds to be partially invested in crypto, most of them introduced in recent weeks. Officials in another three states are engaged in serious discussions about joining in, and the money managers for two states — Michigan and Wisconsin — have already dipped parts of their public employees' retirement portfolios into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If the states begin pouring portions of their public funds into bitcoin and other digital assets, it would potentially lock down billions of dollars of the tokens for extended periods, boosting the value of the assets still openly circulating. Another effect: The states are potentially setting up millions of people to have personal stakes in the health of the crypto sector — whether they want to or not. In several of the proposals, governments are looking to follow in the footsteps of Michigan and Wisconsin in pushing parts of their retirement funds and state pension investments into digital assets. Retired school teachers, law enforcement officers and other public employees will watch some of their financial security become dependent on the fluctuations of the crypto markets. Other pieces of legislation would instruct state treasurers to spend as much as 10% of their public funds on a strategic reserve, with some specifying that qualifying digital assets must have at least a $500 billion market cap, leaving only bitcoin currently meeting the mark. Arizona and Utah are building a lead after getting their efforts passed by legislative committees, but other states weighing some version of a crypto bill also include Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. Others, such as Alabama, Florida and Kentucky are considering proposals from state officials or on the verge of pursuing legislation. The states interested in digital assets reserves are predominantly Republican-majority in their politics, and the reasons the lawmakers say they're backing the bills include investment diversity and embracing technological innovation. The amount put away by the states could eventually be overshadowed by the U.S. government's own reserve, if that effort comes to pass. President Trump, in his wider executive order on U.S. crypto policy, called for his administration to "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile." The order suggested it may be built from government seizures of crypto in criminal cases. The idea had initially been pitched by Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Republican who devotes much of her political bandwidth to supporting crypto and was named as the first chair of the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee. Her bill to set up a U.S. reserve calls for the country to obtain about $20 billion worth of the tokens in the first year and to get another 200,000 in each of the next four years, until the U.S. is eventually holding a million bitcoin. While Lummis' pitch has called it a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve," it's not — like the petroleum reserve — designed for deployment when economic conditions warrant it. It's structured more as a long-term investment, requiring the U.S. to hold the assets for at least 20 years. That would be almost 5% of the eventual, finite supply of global bitcoin going untouched for at least two decades. Combined with whatever the states seek to stockpile, U.S. governments would secure a significant percentage of the asset, in addition to the towering reserves held by the U.S. ETF issuers such as BlackRock and Grayscale and corporate investors led by MicroStrategy. The states' interest in bitcoin potentially lands Satoshi Nakamoto's ultimate exercise of financial outsiders firmly in the realm of the insiders, adding the asset to the core functions of government. The Bitcoin white paper meant to establish a system of transactions outside of the need of financial-firm intermediaries or government oversight. States setting up bitcoin funds managed in part by new laws could become some of the most stable of the industry's institutional investors. And naming bitcoin as a "strategic reserve" puts the digital tokens on par with gold and oil as economic mainstays, despite the very different nature of cryptocurrencies and their practical weaknesses as an inflation hedge. From the perspective of their citizens or public employees, states that grab crypto stakes will come away with two potential outcomes: Millions of people will enjoy more comfortable and well-funded retirements or public services; or millions of people will watch a crypto crash eat into the safety net they're counting on. It could be "disastrous for tens of millions of retirees if government officials gambled with state pension funds to buy bitcoin or crypto," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group that's critical of the dangers of digital assets. He called the idea of a government bitcoin stockpile "a brazen attempt by a handful of crypto billionaires and their political allies to take money out of Main Street taxpayers’ pockets to create artificial demand for a highly volatile product that suffers from boom-bust cycles, is full of fraudulent trading and pricing in unregulated markets, and has no socially legitimate use, but is loved by criminals." Wagers on the prediction site Polymarket have put the odds of one of the states beginning to set aside bitcoin reserves before the end of this month at 11%, and the chances of the U.S. setting up such a reserve this year at the national level are at 45%. It may already be a trend that governments around the world can't ignore. "We anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin," Fidelity Digital Assets researchers predicted in a look-ahead report for 2025. "Facing challenges such as debilitating inflation, currency debasement, and increasingly crushing fiscal deficits, not making any bitcoin allocation could become more of a risk to nations than making one."

Title: Vanguard dilutes diversity guidelines for US board proxy voting

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The updated policies exclude a recommendation that boards “at a minimum, represent diversity of personal characteristics, inclusive of at least diversity in gender, race, and ethnicity.” Vanguard’s updated U.S. proxy voting policy places an emphasis on complying with “relevant market-specific governance frameworks” and market-specific norms. The exclusion of recommendations comes as President Donald Trump has looked to reverse his predecessor’s legacy on diversity, equity and inclusion at the federal level and ordered agencies to put pressure on private sector DEI efforts. Vanguard still retains language in both its 2025 global proxy voting policy and U.S. regional policy that states its funds look for company boards “to be fit for purpose by reflecting sufficient breadth of skills, experience, perspective, and personal characteristics (such as age, gender, and/or race/ethnicity) resulting in cognitive diversity,” to enable effective and independent oversight. “The updates to the 2025 proxy voting policies do not represent significant year-over-year changes — they are a standard part of Vanguard’s annual review process, and reflect the evolving regulatory landscape across local markets,” Spero said. Vanguard’s 2025 global and U.S. proxy voting guidelines on board composition say that to assess how well-suited companies’ board composition is, its managed funds “seek fulsome disclosure of a board’s process for building, assessing, and maintaining an effective board well-suited to supporting the company’s strategy, long-term performance, and shareholder returns.” Those disclosures should include each board member’s “range of skills, background and experience” and their alignment with company strategy, the policies say. The changes were first reported by Reuters on Friday. Vanguard’s 2024 U.S. proxy voting policy is no longer available on its site, following the update, but has been preserved by web archive, the Wayback Machine. The updated voting policy is in effect as of Feb. 1. The policy changes come amid a broader retreat from public ESG and DEI commitments and falling support for environmental and social shareholder proposals. Vanguard supported zero environmental and social proposals in the 2024 proxy season, as BlackRock and State Street also supported fewer environmental and social proposals and overall support for related proposals fell to 16.2%, according to Diligent Market Intelligence. Vanguard also defended its decision to back ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods for re-election in 2024, after state finance officials publicly opposed him and his director slate for the energy giant’s lawsuit against a pair of activist investors. This proxy season will be the first under CEO Salim Ramji, after Tim Buckley retired in 2024. Once Ramji officially took the reins, over 8,000 individual Vanguard clients wrote to the investment firm’s top executive, urging him to put climate risk “at the forefront” of Vanguard’s investment management strategies.

Title: Trump signs order creating first-ever US sovereign wealth fund —and TikTok could be its first purchase

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/04/2025 5:07:08 AM PST by V_TWIN WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Monday to create a sovereign US wealth fund — saying that TikTok may become one of its first acquisitions. A sovereign wealth fund is an investment fund owned and operated by a government. The world’s largest and wealthiest such funds are owned by China and resource-rich countries like Norway and Middle Eastern emirates. It was not immediately specified how the US endowment — the creation of which was first reported last month by The Post’s Charles Gasparino — would be capitalized, but Trump previously floated using tariff proceeds. It’s unclear if adding a stake in TikTok would require up-front investment, or if Beijing would offload it without charge to avoid a looming 10% levy that Trump announced Friday. “It’s a very exciting event. We’re going to have a sovereign wealth fund, which we’ve never had,” Trump said in the Oval Office — as News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison sat nearby.

Hard to imagine that would have been allowed if the US government owned it. This is the first bad idea of his. No thanks to government or big tech taking it over. That would ruin it. Might as well turn it over directly to the CIA/FBI and cut out the middleman. We still hang to think of the day a democrat comes into office. We don’t need anything that will make the government bigger and more powerful.

Musk wants help getting out of his Bitcoin position Where in the US Constitution does the government get privileges to tax us to compete against us by operating a private enterprise? So the government is going to pick and choose companies they think are good investments? And then they have a fiduciary interest in their success? That doesn’t sound very American. Strategic reserves are one thing…stockpiling natural resources is one thing. Buying social media companies is quite another. We are lacking the first pre-requisite for a SWF, and that is Sovereign Wealth. We have only sovereign debt. We are a debtor nation. The countries with a SWF are usually small nations that have cash to invest, often from selling oil. The whole notion is ludicrous, but it will be a good way for Trump to enrich his cronies, so I expect it will continue to be talked about. How will it be funded? No clue. Good point. SWFs such as Norway’s and Alaska’s and Texas’ and Russia’s are typically based on natural resources. Getting too general in scope could cause other conflicts. Imagine poppy pants Biden with trillions of dollars of “fun money” in a Sovereign Wealth Fund. Because that or worse will happen some day. How well did the government do with the Social Security money you sent them from your paycheck? Pay down the debt. Cut taxes. Don’t give government more control of resources. The government is about to have a huge influx of money from tariffs. That will easily fund this. It is a brilliant idea. They will look at it as just another way to ‘pick the pocket’ of our economy (just like they do with the tax code now). Seems to work out pretty well for Norway and Saudi. Like a government endowment fund. I don’t see the downside, as long as it is managed openly and responsibly. There would need to be guardrails to keep it from being used to manipulate markets. Probably less hazardous than bad actors like BlackRock and the hedge fund universe. Good point. It works be the next USAID slush fund. And besides, we are 37 trillion in debt. We don’t have money for a slush fund. It’s bad if there government owns a social media company, it’s worse if it’s a public private partnership Benito would approve of. Very bad idea.

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Six new asset management companies (AMCs) are set to enter the fast-growing mutual fund (MF) industry this year and the asset under management (AUM) of MFs growing 32 per cent to ₹66.93 lakh crore in December 2024 against ₹52.74 lakh crore in December 2023. The market regulator has already given ‘in-principle’ approval to Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings, and final approval to Angel One and Unifi Capital. The market regulator initially grants in-principal approval after reviewing the application and assessing the applicants’ basic eligibility. After this, the applicant is allowed to start MF business by setting up the infrastructure and hire the core team. The regulator inspects the progress of the companies after six months and issues the final licence if the applicant meets all the criteria. Unifi, in fact, has filed a draft paper with SEBI for its maiden fund - Unifi Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund . In the past few months, SEBI has issued several partial and final approvals for the new MF players (applicants) to widen the MF reach and attract investors from smaller towns.AlphaGrep Securities, Ask Investment Managers and Monarch Networth Capital have also filed applications that are under consideration with SEBI. In 2023, five new AMCs entered the MF industry, but three of them entered through acquisitions. Vivek Sharma, Head of Investment, Estee Advisors, said while the MF industry has seen a tremendous growth, much of it was from equity schemes. The number of debt schemes has grown to 317 last year from 314 at the end of 2023. In contrast, equity schemes saw a significant net addition of 70 new funds. AMFI had proposed a Debt-Linked Savings Schemes to the Finance Ministry, but there was no mention of it in the Finance Minister’s speech, he said. Currently, the total expense ratio (TER) for debt funds ranges from 0.8 per cent for AUM above ₹50,000 crore and a maximum of 2 per cent for the first ₹500 crore. Providing incentives will definitely improve adoption of debt products, but higher TER means a lower return for investors, he added. Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager, Whitespace Alpha, said while more fund houses create an illusion of expanded choices, most of them will be equity-focused, particularly targeting small-cap, mid-cap and thematic segments. With too many equity funds chasing a limited set of investment opportunities, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks, liquidity constraints and valuation risks will increase, he added.

Title: What the EV Industry’s Challenges Reveal About Innovation and Regulation

Time Published: 2025-02-04T13:00:44Z

A conversation with WSJ journalist Mike Colias on disruption and competition. Many consumers are buying electric vehicles, thanks to sportscar-like performance, government incentives, and personal motivations to minimize climate change. But the EV industry overall has revved and sputtered in unpredictable ways and offers a case study in managing innovation, regulation, and competition. Mike Colias, deputy bureau chief at The Wall Street Journal, explains the complex landscape that incumbents such as GM and Ford and start-ups like Tesla find themselves in. Through stories of iconic industry executives and bold competitive moves, he shares insights that leaders in every industry can learn from. Colias wrote the new book Inevitable: Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles. CURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Curt Nickisch. Innovation often happens slowly and then all at once. That’s the felt reality of disruptive innovation. Basically, if a big company doesn’t watch out, a startup can come in with a new inferior offering. Ignored long enough that upstart can improve its product and eventually, seemingly suddenly put the incumbent out of business. That phenomenon is well understood now. What’s hard is getting the timing right. You move too quickly to the new tech and customers aren’t there yet, you’re out of luck. Wait too long, someone else eats your lunch. Even when established companies recognize disruptive innovations and deliberately bring them on, it’s a complex balancing act to transition the business for the future. Case in point, actually cases in point, electric vehicles. The car industry is bursting with disruptive innovation case studies in the making. You’ll find many of them to learn from in the new book, Inevitable, Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles. The author is Mike Colias, Deputy Bureau Chief at the Wall Street Journal, and he joins us now. Hi, Mike. MIKE COLIAS: Hi, Curt. Thanks for having me on. CURT NICKISCH: It’s such a fascinating industry, of legacy companies, amazing brands, this consumer technology that we all totally get and are totally familiar with. A lot of emotion and economics involved. Then you’ve got electric vehicle technology, you’ve got driverless automation technology. It’s just a really amazing business. I think maybe we should set the scene here. Why do customers buy electric vehicles? What do companies know that they’re looking for? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, we’ve seen this evolution playing out now for about 15 years. It was 2010 is when GM came out with this Chevrolet Volt. It was actually a plugin hybrid. Nissan had the Leaf. That was a full EV and they came out about the same time and it was a big deal. It was a breakthrough. What you saw, I think, from 2010 to early this decade was a lot of people bought it for certainly environmental reasons. You had a lot of people who were interested in the technology, who wanted to just have the latest thing, who wanted to have the first EV in the neighborhood, those early adopters. As we’ve gotten to recent years and you’ve seen more and more models coming out – we can talk about why the industry has tried to pivot so hard toward EVs – more and more people are interested in them. I mean, surveys show that of the average car buyer, roughly half of them are at least open to the idea of electrics, but it’s less of the early adopter who’s going to, “Hey, I’ll pay 20 grand above sticker for this new electric truck,” and it’s more of a discerning buyer who’s maybe on the fence about it and has to be convinced. So I think that’s where you’re starting to see some headwinds in the industry. All the car companies went really big for a number of reasons. Now sales are still going up in the U.S., but the companies are having a harder time getting people to make that jump to electric because they’re more your everyday buyer. They’re trying to figure out how it fits into their life rather than just so enamored by the technology or what it can do for the environment. CURT NICKISCH: Why do people get enamored by the technology? I think what advantages do electric vehicles have? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think for a long time they were thought of as these glorified golf carts. I don’t think people really thought that they could have the capability and reliability, fun to drive, all the reasons why a lot of people choose their vehicle. I think Tesla really showed that EVs can be sporty and fun to drive, and so you get into one today and now many, many brands, I mean, the choice has really exploded in the last couple years. You can expect it to be super quiet, very zippy. You feel like you’re driving the future a bit. I’ll credit this to a colleague of mine, Dan Neil who writes a column for the Wall Street Journal on cars. He said, “If you drive an electric, going back to a gas engine car is like going back to whale oil lamps.” You know, not everybody. There are examples of people who just realize after six months, “Hey, maybe this isn’t for me,” but by and large people don’t go back. CURT NICKISCH: Is there any doubt in your mind that the industry is going to shift to electric vehicles? I mean, some people might say it’s a fad or it’s just not going to last. Inevitable, the title of your book came from Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, who said it’s an inevitable transition. What’s your opinion from your experience? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, it’s funny, we actually titled the book before he said that, and so it was nice that we’re getting some backup from the industry. No, I think it is interesting because from the time I started the book, let’s say 2021 ish, it was all systems go. All of the companies were saying, “We’re pouring all of our capital into this. We’re going to have dozens of electric vehicles by X date.” GM made a lot of news when they said they were going to be fully electric by 2035. Then the slowdown, which we’ve already talked about, where consumers are like, well, not quite so fast. I think they did to a certain extent leave the consumer out of the picture when they were making these decisions. So now it is messy. You’ve got companies who are starting to slow walk some of their factory investments or cancel models. President Trump and Republicans have been pretty harsh on electric vehicles. They’ve made it known that… It’s become very politicized in the last couple of years, and we can talk a little bit more about why that is. So right now it looks like a tough time for EVs and it is in the U.S. That gets to why I think this goes from where it is now to inevitable is, in China… So everyone talks about the EV transition. There’s multiple transitions unfolding around the globe. China is the leader in EVs. Nearly half of all car sales in China are now either electric or plug in hybrid. This is really gets back to why it’s so difficult to be the leader of a car company today. If you’re Mary Barra sitting in Detroit. She took over in early 2014. One of her lines I remember at the time was we’re going to see more change in the next five years than we have in the last 50. Mary was one of the first big car company CEOs to declare this is what we’re doing, this is the path. For the company that puts out big Cadillac escalades and Corvettes that roar around the track, 8 cylinder, that’s a jarring thing to hear. Mary gets a lot of the credit for that. It’s a bit of an unfinished story because the execution of thoses EVs that she put the plans in place for the last decade have kind of stumbled, at least in the last several years. And now they’re starting to get really good cars out and they’re hitting this sort of demand headwind where consumers maybe aren’t showing up in ways that they expected. And only 5% of your sales are electric and you’re losing billions of dollars on that, and you’re making, I think they’re going to make something like 12 to 14 billion, that’s what they’ll have made in 2024. That all comes from big pickup trucks and SUVs. How do you play that? Europe’s somewhere in the middle, 20 to 25% of their sales are EVs. So you’ve got to decide, okay, am I going to lean into this thing that right now my investors don’t like and I’m losing a ton of money on because I know that in the future I’ll probably have to compete. She’s on record as saying the future is electric, so they have to put their money where their mouth is, but it hurts right now to do that. CURT NICKISCH: She’s one of the really interesting case studies in the book. Somebody who’s trying to manage that transition. You painted a picture where GM is making a lot of money by selling its quote, unquote, legacy vehicles, but also not seeing its stock price go up. Meanwhile, there’s this other company, Tesla, that’s putting out all electric vehicles, only electric vehicles. It’s not making money at that time early on, but its stock price was going up because investors thought that that’s where the future was going to be. And it was just interesting to see somebody who was making money as a CEO, but envious of the growth of a competitor stock price. What does that say about the business challenge that she was facing? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think if you look at Tesla, their investor base doesn’t look like the investors who go into the stocks of the traditional automakers. The autos is not a growth, it’s not been a growth industry for a very long time. So their stocks are assigned values that reflect that. It’s slow, steady, but investors don’t go into a stock like GM looking for a big moonshot bet on self-driving cars and electric cars. That’s a big source of frustration to the CEOs of these companies. For years, auto executives rolled their eyes or dismissed Tesla, didn’t think they’d ever get to be able to mass market cars. They wouldn’t be able to get their factories. Making cars is hard, and it was hard for Tesla. Once they punched through, I think that’s when they came out with a Model 3 around the 2018 timeframe. That was the proof point that I think the industry needed to say, “Okay, these guys are for real, and oh, by the way, their stock value just passed ours.” Then by the time you get to 2020, 2021, Tesla is worth more than the top 10 automakers in the world combined, market cap. So there’s two big reasons why the industry piled into EVs as seemingly suddenly as they did. One was boring. It was regulations around the world, climate change, regulators, politicians were trying to get a handle on that problem. CURT NICKISCH: Just to underline that there, they’re offering tax incentives and things like that for customers who buy EVs. So trying to tilt the economic playing field a little bit in the favor of electric vehicle adoption. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah. The regulatory part of the story is more, it’s like carrot and stick. Yes. Incentives to get companies to make EVs and batteries and for consumers to buy them. Also, tougher regulations, right around tailpipe emissions, how much carbon you could emit and other pollutants. So over the years, the companies could meet those regulations through improvements to their gas powered vehicles and diesel vehicles. There were, I think the miles per gallon today is something like double what it was in the late ’70s. So there was tons of improvement in the internal combustion engine, but it got to a point where these regulations have become so tight, especially in Europe and China, that the companies needed to start to electrify. The regulations certainly pushed them in this direction, but the effect of Tesla and other startups, and now the Chinese really I think is what got the attention of the global auto CEO to say, “We’re getting left behind. Investors aren’t paying attention to us. We need to go in this direction.” CURT NICKISCH: You have a really great image, a good leadership lesson here in the book of Ford CEO, Jim Farley, meeting with his engineers and doing a teardown of a Tesla and a Ford electric vehicle side by side. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, Jim Farley, this is early 2022 when they did this exercise, and he’d only been CEO for a little over a year. He had been talking to some of his engineering leaders a few weeks beforehand, and he was pondering this question. He was one of the few auto executives who really was paranoid about Tesla back in the early days. So he’s always been looking over his shoulder at Tesla, and when he got to be CEO, he knew that that was going to be really his biggest nemesis or one of them. So he wanted to get a better handle on how Tesla had become so successful, starting to turn a profit at that point where really none of the traditional automakers were profitable. CURT NICKISCH: In EVs, yeah. MIKE COLIAS: In EVs. Right. So he questioned his engineering leadership. He said, “I don’t know that we’re designing these EVs in the most efficient way. What’s the difference between the way we do it and the way Tesla does it?” According to Jim, he was told that there really isn’t much of a difference. So he ordered up this dissection side by side of a Tesla Model Y and a Ford Mach-E, which had been… It’s an SUV. It’s really cool looking. It had done really well in the market. These teardowns engineers in the auto industry do them all the time; somewhat rare to have a CEO roll up his sleeves and want to get involved. So this empty warehouse in Dearborn near the headquarters, they had these two cars. They picked them apart. And the results were, there was a pile of guts laying on the floor next to the Ford that was a lot bigger than the pile of stuff laying next to the Tesla. There were brackets that didn’t need to be there, and there was something like hundreds of feet of wiring more in the Ford than there was in the Tesla. So it’s just all cost in weight, when weight is a killer when you’re trying to squeeze more miles out of an electric car. So he was upset about this, and the next week he paraded the board through this warehouse to show them this is what we’re up against. If we don’t figure out how to do this and get the cost out and compete with a company that has only been making cars really for five years, and we’ve been doing it for a century, we’re going to lose this. He’s really talked in terms of how this is an existential threat and battle that Ford is under right now. CURT NICKISCH: “Only the paranoid survive,” that was Andy Grove at Intel’s disruptive innovation lesson. What I liked about that story was just how it showed how a company that’s using a technology that leapfrogs you, that was it. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, it’s the innovator’s dilemma, right? Which I’m sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with. This idea that institutionally you almost have this subconscious aversion toward jumping to the thing that is going to be the next big growth area because it requires abandoning what you’ve done and what has worked so well for you for a century. And in this case, some of that inertia of how you design a car. It’s always been with a big engine block up front and a transmission running through the middle to the rear of the car. One of the executives I talk to a lot calls it scar tissue. They haven’t been able to figure out a real great, clean sheet design for electric vehicles, at least not until recently. Now we’re starting to see some of those come out. There’s a lot of great cars out there, but companies like Tesla and the Chinese are just, it’s sort of like you get the feeling they’re on versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, when many of the traditionals are one and 2.0. CURT NICKISCH: One really emblematic episode in your book is just when Tesla lowers its prices. So for a long time you’ve got these established car companies in the U.S., they realize that electrics are where they need to go. They start putting lots and lots of money into it. It’s all about cost. You have to drive those costs down and make it profitable at scale. They’re matching Tesla as a benchmark. And right when they feel like they’re about to put models into the market, Tesla lowers its prices. Can you describe just how meaningful that was and what that meant for these big car makers? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think as you described, it was really this gut punch because this is early, right at the beginning of 2023. Until then, the EV story was really, EVs were taking off and you had people willing to pay above sticker price and on wait lists to get these new models. We were finally getting new cars, new EVs onto the market that weren’t Tesla’s. The other brands had finally gotten into the game and they were still not making money on these EVs. They didn’t have the scale yet. They’re only making a few thousand to start, and it’s still a money losing endeavor, but it was looking bright because the demand seemed to be there. When Musk took the step to weaponize his profit margin is what one executive described it to me, because by that time, Tesla’s profit margins, the company, the auto industry thought would never be able to be profitable, had been way bigger than the rest of the industry. So he had some headroom. He was more profitable than these other companies just on a company-wide basis, let alone the fact that these companies were actually losing money on their EVs and making money on gas power cars. So what he decided to do, and this might not… We don’t know exactly his reasoning. CURT NICKISCH: He said his reasoning was to democratize access to these vehicles. MIKE COLIAS: Right. And that’s a message that he’s had for a long time. He said many times that he started Tesla for environmental reasons and he wanted as many people as they could to drive electric cars. Competition probably played into it too. The other thing that’s super scary, I think for if you’re a CEO of a car company, what Elon Musk now believes is that it doesn’t really matter how much money I make on the initial sale of a car. I’m adding so much software, specifically self-driving software, to the point where if you own a Tesla, you’re going to be able to flip a switch and have it be a robot car and you could rent it out and have it serve as a driverless Uber. That’s going to be five times more valuable than this car company I’ve created. So he’s working on that, and it’s to be determined how soon or if and when that ever happens. The point is for the rest of the industry, if that’s what he believes, and he doesn’t care that much about what he prices his cars at, or if he prices them at a loss, that’s a big problem for the companies who are just scraping to try to turn up any kind of profit on their electric cars. It just completely pulled the rug out from under the rest of the industry. CURT NICKISCH: Meanwhile, I mean, we’re talking about a lot of US-based companies here, but you have Chinese electric vehicle companies driving a lot of innovation. I mean, I heard from somebody recently who said they would prefer some Chinese EV models to Mercedes, that they’re really that good. A lot of those are selling in Europe now, but there are tariffs in the US. You also have this, even for Tesla, you have the possibility of Chinese car makers disrupting Tesla or U.S. ones. MIKE COLIAS: Yes. Elon Musk has been quoted as saying that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive in the world now. It’s a fascinating story. I mean, this was one of the things that I found most surprising, and I had to research the Chinese market more. So a lot of the stuff in my day-to-day job, I just uncovered by covering the industry. I’d been to China a few times, but I didn’t really know the origin story and how they came to be such a juggernaut. I mean, they just made the decision to leap ahead. They knew they weren’t very competitive in internal combustion cars. The big global companies have been doing it for a century. The Chinese industry was young, and it was a conscious decision to invest in electric. Plenty of government money went into incentives for companies to build them and consumers to buy them. They invested heavily in the charger. I think there’s like 20 times more fast chargers in China than there is in the U.S. CURT NICKISCH: When you say they, a lot of this is government funded or government supported infrastructure investment. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah. Many, if not most of the Chinese automakers have some level of government ownership. People point out that federal government in the U.S. also provides subsidies and assists EVs. I think in China it’s at a much bigger scale. There’s also other advantages I think that those Chinese companies have been able to bring to bear. The supply chain is more developed, the raw materials for the batteries, cheaper labor. There’s all sorts of factors that have gone into the Chinese being able to make this stuff roughly a 30% less cost and expense that goes into their EVs. At the same time, as you alluded to, they’re really good. Many of them. They’re still cheap and cheerful brands over there. There’s brands that to your point, if you walked into a showroom and put it next to a BMW or a Tesla, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference and you might gravitate toward the Chinese one. I mean, the product is really good. So I don’t know of any auto executive who feels comfortable about with the fact that the governments are going to protect them with tariffs from the Chinese threat of EV makers who are making a lot of cars in China, too many. So now they’re exporting them around the world. So if you’re a CEO sitting in Germany or Detroit or Tokyo, I don’t think you’re going to be comfortable just assuming that those cars are never going to reach your shores. If you make a really good car that’s affordable, consumers eventually are going to demand them. Politicians are going to bend to that will. So I think Mary Barra, Jim Farley, a lot of these CEOs know that, and they know that they’re going to have to compete, even though China has arguably a decade headstart on this transition. CURT NICKISCH: One conclusion that you have in your book, and that’s at the moment that we are now, is that at least in the U.S. market, hybrid vehicles are the entry level electric vehicles for a lot of families still, a lot of drivers, that jumping directly to electric might not happen as quickly as people forecast. MIKE COLIAS: I think for the consumer and for the broader transition, I think that’s probably a good thing to have this bridge technology where people can get a feel for what electrons can do for your driving and your fuel consumption. So there are so many brands now that offer hybrid options across their lineups where you don’t have to plug anything in. It’s a motor and a small battery that sits in the background that actually many of them, it gives you a little more power. They’re more fun to drive, and oh, by the way, you’re getting 30 or 40% better fuel economy. So I think that’s an important part of this transition that a lot of the companies wanted to skip over because you’d rather just go to the end solution and pick one technology and go with that. Certainly GM, that was their strategy was we don’t really think hybrids are necessary. And they probably missed that one. They’ve said they’re going to now go back and offer some hybrids. 20 years ago, if you drove a Prius, it was like a stigma attached to that. Now people don’t think about it. There’s a bigger leap to make from a hybrid to a full electric in a car you need to plug in and monitor your charge and all that. There are bigger habits to change, but I see it playing out the same way where the more you see electric cars, know neighbors who have one get into them, people start to warm up to that idea of plugging in the car. You’re right. I think hybrids are going to be here for a long time. I think it’s another reason why we’re not going to hit, at least in the U.S. a tipping point real soon on the full electric story. CURT NICKISCH: Mike, this has been really interesting. So much at play in this industry, and it was great to hear about it. Thanks for coming on the show. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, thanks so much, Curt. I really enjoyed the conversation.

Posted on 02/04/2025 4:58:32 AM PST by marcusmaximus The Kremlin on Tuesday called US President Donald Trump's plans to exchange Ukrainian rare earth minerals for further military aid a “commercial proposal.” -snip- “Well, probably, if we call a spade a spade, this is an offer to buy aid, that is, not to continue to provide it on a gratuitous or other basis, but to provide it on a commercial basis,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow. “It is better, of course, not to provide assistance at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,” Peskov further said. He said that the essence of Trump's ideas regarding a settlement in Ukraine are unclear, but that it is obvious US arms supplies to Kyiv will continue as none have declared otherwise.

Buying “outright “ still gives money to Zand Ukraine. However if you mean trade minerals for money or weapons, then I agree. In addition to new weapons we have lots of surplus we can trade, but to do that, Putin needs to return to his 2013 borders. Something he cannot do and survive. Still think there is a good chance that China will annex much of eastern Russian “federation”.

Buying “outright “ still gives money to Zand Ukraine. However if you mean trade minerals for money or weapons, then I agree. In addition to new weapons we have lots of surplus we can trade, but to do that, Putin needs to return to his 2013 borders. Something he cannot do and survive.

Title: 30 questions you should ask about DeepSeek
URL: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/30-questions-you-should-ask-about-deepseek/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T12:25:54Z
Full Content:
Ex-AI product lead, now AI journalist. Cutting through noise with critical analysis of ethics, business, and society. No hype. Just truth. In this post, AI expert Jing Hu provides the lowdown on DeepSeek and the state of AI. Check out the article and some more of her great deep dives on her Substack here. Let’s start with a question that might sting a little. When did we all become so bad at thinking and focus solely on being panicked? AI industry in panic after China’s DeepSeek overtakes ChatGPT and Meta— The Independent or DeepSeek tech wipeout erases more than $1 trillion in market cap as AI panic grips Wall Street— Business Insider People sell/act first, think later (or never). Algorithms amplify fear, headlines scream about China’s AI leap, and everyone’s left scrambling to separate reality from runaway hype. Here’s how one shockwave enhances the next: It is much easier to hit “sell” or repost how DeepSeek makes Sam Altman panic than to ask, Wait—what exactly are we panicked about? This isn’t about dismissing concerns. I simply refuse to drown in the noise. This article won’t spoon-feed you with my conclusion. Instead, I will walk you through my thought process while interrogating you with guided questions in clear categorization. You get to pick what is most critical to you. Very simple, three parts: Finally, a Survival Toolkit that sums up the red flags to spot via a mindmap template for you to download and expand your own thoughts at your own pace. It began in a Shanghai high-rise in 2021. Liang Wenfeng, was a hedge fund manager who made a billion-dollar bet that would alter AI history. As his team at High-Flyer Capital developed trading algorithms, Liang quietly ordered staff to acquire every available Nvidia A100 GPU in Asia. It is estimated he hoarded 10,000 chips through shell companies for faster stock predictions. At least, that was the plan in 2021. Then, in 2022, the Biden administration restricted the export of advanced computing chips. The Pivot 2023, Chinese regulators cracking down on quant funds. Liang stunned investors by redirecting 90% of their assets into an AI startup. Skeptics walked out; true believers stayed to build DeepSeek. Trial by Fire Rumor says the early prototypes leaked in 2024 through a junior engineer's GitHub account. But of course, this is a rumor. What we do know is that DeepSeek has polished open-source models that undercut rivals. Here’s their Github. Breakthrough The rise of DeepSeek has been nothing short of a disruptive underdog story. Think of it as “Temu of AI.” In May 2024, DeepSeek shook up the industry by releasing DeepSeek V2 as an open-source model, sparking a full-scale price war… at least in China. On December 26, 2024, they did it again. With DeepSeek V3, the prices are even lower, redefining industry expectations: $0.14 per million tokens. Shock and Awe On January 20, 2025, R1 was released. The news on everyone’s feed is that R1 architecture delivers OpenAI o1 level reasoning at 1/10th the compute cost. By Monday, January 27, 2025, triggers a $1T tech stock selloff (17% drop in Nvidia + 5.6% sector-wide decline) as investors question Nvidia's AI infrastructure dominance. A basic understanding of why DeepSeek R1 is so special is the foundation for you and me to ask critical questions. Three most important technical breakthroughs from DeepSeek’s R1 model. With no-brainer analogies, don’t worry, even if you aren’t a techie. Here’s the R1 Paper (only if you are interested, of course). The "Teamwork" AI Design (Mixture of Experts— MoE) Instead of a "jack-of-all-trades" AI like OpenAI o1, think of R1 as a team of specialized experts collaborating like a kitchen crew. There’s a master chef (the teacher model) who then trains line cooks (small models) through knowledge distillation. So a powerful AI can run on your laptop while staying smart, like getting Michelin-star meals from your home kitchen at a low cost. MoE focuses on modularity and specialization for efficient task handling; OpenAI o1 emphasizes deep reasoning within a single model framework optimized for complex problem-solving. Self-Taught Reasoning (using only Reinforcement Learning)DeepSeek’s AI learned to reason on its own by trial and error, without extra guidance. It was given problems (math, coding) and rewarded for correct answers and logical steps. Think of teaching a kid to ride a bike or play puzzle by letting them figure it out and rewarding the kid if they’ve done well. In contrast, OpenAI o1 is more like providing a structured problem-solving method and refining and improving within that framework. Predicting Multiple Steps Ahead (Multi-Token Prediction)The old way is like a chess player who only thinks one move ahead. On the other hand, DeepSeek R1 is like a chess player thinking several moves ahead. DeepSeek R1 predicts several words or steps at once. In comparison, OpenAI's o1 prioritizes deeper reasoning with step-by-step problem-solving. Knowledge Condensing (Distillation)Imagine you’re preparing for an exam. You have the option to go with a 1,000-page textbook or a 100-page study guide that captures the key points, summaries, and essential concepts. While the study guide doesn’t include every detail from the textbook, it’s compact and efficient enough to help you perform well on the exam. In AI terms, the textbook is the large, complex AI model (the "teacher"). The smaller, distilled model (the "student") is the study guide. The process of creating the study guide is knowledge distillation. Key questions you should ask to separate DeepSeek reality from hype: DeepSeek's claim of ultra-low training costs for their AI model has raised eyebrows in the tech community. It is also evident in their report that the training cost has excluded costs associated with prior research, ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data. Still, the million as the unit of training cost starkly contrasts with the billions spent by US tech giants. If true (the H800 and the hours), it will disrupt the established business models. The precise methodologies underlying DeepSeek's breakthrough remain undisclosed. There’s also a back-of-envelope calculation from an analyst that supports the low-cost claim. Training cost comparison between DeepSeek V3 and Llama 3.1. DeepSeek, in theory, has no access (if not smuggled) to H100 GPU Those who question the claim: Some data scientists questioned whether DeepSeek had been developed with only 2,000 chips. They noted that the company might have operations with tens of thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used in development. Don't worry if you don't get any of these. The main takeaway is that, aside from the report by DeepSeek, no one yet can confirm their claim about training costs. It can be true… but we don't know until someone can replicate a similar model with an equally low cost. Key questions for you to ask: What’s the catch of this low cost? Could there be a tradeoffs, e.g., What can’t this AI do well, and why? Now, you’ve learned the foundation. Shockwave #1: Major Tech Players. DeepSeek R1 and more threaten the core premise of existing AI giants: dominance requires scale (more data, more compute, more $$). If a lean Chinese startup can match OpenAI o1’s reasoning at 1/10th the cost, what does that mean for the "spend billions to win" playbook? Shockwave #2: Chip Industry and Infracture. Many news and influencers argue that Jevons Paradox will kick in. Simply put: Cheaper models → More startups (more AI usage) → More GPU buyers. But what factors must exist for the Jevon paradox to be true? To say the least, it requires elastic AI demand, market needs, and other complementary resources to be available (e.g., engineers know how to build an efficient model as R1 does). So questions you should ask: Shockwave #3: Copyright Infringement and Data Privacy. DeepSeek’s success raises tricky legal and ethical questions about who truly “owns” AI, the data, or the model used to train the next generation. At the center of the debate is distillation (where a large model “teaches” a smaller model) and the copyrighted content used to train the earlier LLMs. Since the massive dataset is the fuel, where do privacy and intellectual property rights fit? Questions to ask Good read: OpenAI’s privacy policy. The first sentence in the policy: When you visit, use, or interact with the Services, we receive the following information about your visit, use, or interactions… DeepSeek’s policy, collects certain information when users set up an account). It’s really about who you want to give your data to…The Chinese government or American commercial companies. Shockwave #4: Startups and Smaller AI Firms Yes, lower-cost training and inference could open doors for resource-strapped ventures. But does that also mean smaller players suddenly face a more crowded space, competing with DeepSeek itself and a throng of new entrants? Shockwave #5: Enterprises and End Users DeepSeek isn’t pushing AI to do anything dramatically “new” regarding raw capabilities. It’s distilling knowledge from existing large models at a fraction of the usual cost. Would This efficiency revolution trickle down to enterprises and end users? Instead of a technical leap forward in intelligence by DeepSeek it is rather a cost revolution. However, that economic shift alone can significantly change how enterprises plan, deploy, and pay for AI. And how quickly people see tangible benefits every day. Shockwave #6: Geopolitical and Regulatory DeepSeek’s apparent success amid export controls spotlights a broader power struggle. Can bans on high-end chips (like Nvidia’s H100) actually curb AI development? Western nations face a choice: double down on regulations or adapt to a new competitive reality. While others are still panicking about DeepSeek's efficiency breakthrough, the smart ones ask more profound questions about where this leads us. What about the near-term future? The Real AGI Question R1-Zero's self-training capabilities raise fascinating possibilities. But instead of asking, "Is this AGI?" ask: What happens when AI can self-learn and self-improve at a fraction of today's cost? The real opportunity in DeepSeek's breakthrough isn't just about cheaper AI. It's about who can ask the right questions and act accordingly. Here’s the mindmap for you: Survival Toolkit.

Here's how the company did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: For the first quarter, PayPal expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.17, which is higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.13. Earnings for the year will come in at $4.95 to $5.10 a share, topping the $4.90 average estimate, according to LSEG. PayPal also announced a new $15 billion share buyback program, and expects to make around $6 billion in repurchases in 2025. Revenue increased about 4% in the quarter from $8.03 billion a year ago. Total payment volume, an indication of how digital payments are faring in the broader economy, was just short of estimates, coming in at $437.8 billion for the fourth quarter, versus the $438.2 billion analysts projected. While PayPal's take rate slipped to 1.91% from 1.96% a year earlier, transaction margin, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business, rose to 47% from 45.8%. In 2024, transaction margin dollars grew 7% to $14.7 billion, bolstered by Braintree, a service Meta uses for credit-card processing. The company said it anticipates growth of 4% to 5% in transaction margin dollars in 2025 to $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion PayPal's stock is up 43% in the past year, as of Monday's close. CEO Alex Chriss, who joined the company in September 2023, is trying to revive growth at PayPal, which had been been mired in a deep slump due to increased competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Chriss has focused on prioritizing profitable growth and better monetizing key acquisitions like Braintree and payments app Venmo. Venmo's total payment volume rose 10% in the quarter from a year earlier. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. In the short term, Chriss has said the two primary monetization levers are Venmo's debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance both online and offline, and Pay With Venmo, which provides a seamless way for customers to pay online. Monthly active accounts for the debit card grew more than 30% in 2024, and Pay with Venmo monthly actives increased more than 20%. The company added 8.8 million active accounts last year. One of Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. That product, dubbed Fastlane, launched in August, and is a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In 2024, branded checkout volume rose more than 6%, thanks in part to strength across large enterprise platforms. The other big product launch in 2024 was PayPal Everywhere, which went live in early September. The initiative offers 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. "The improvements we made to branded checkout, peer-to-peer, and Venmo, plus the progress we made on our price-to-value strategy, are beginning to show up in our results," Chriss said in the earnings statement. The company will hold an earnings call at 8:00 A.M. Eastern time. WATCH: PayPal's crypto lead on allowing merchants to buy and sell virtual assets Got a confidential news tip?

Here's how the company did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: For the first quarter, PayPal expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.17, which is higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.13. Earnings for the year will come in at $4.95 to $5.10 a share, topping the $4.90 average estimate, according to LSEG. PayPal also announced a new $15 billion share buyback program, and expects to make around $6 billion in repurchases in 2025. Revenue increased about 4% in the quarter from $8.03 billion a year ago. Total payment volume, an indication of how digital payments are faring in the broader economy, was just short of estimates, coming in at $437.8 billion for the fourth quarter, versus the $438.2 billion analysts projected. While PayPal's take rate slipped to 1.91% from 1.96% a year earlier, transaction margin, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business, rose to 47% from 45.8%. In 2024, transaction margin dollars grew 7% to $14.7 billion, bolstered by Braintree, a service Meta uses for credit-card processing. The company said it anticipates growth of 4% to 5% in transaction margin dollars in 2025 to $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion PayPal's stock is up 43% in the past year, as of Monday's close. CEO Alex Chriss, who joined the company in September 2023, is trying to revive growth at PayPal, which had been been mired in a deep slump due to increased competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Chriss has focused on prioritizing profitable growth and better monetizing key acquisitions like Braintree and payments app Venmo. Venmo's total payment volume rose 10% in the quarter from a year earlier. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. In the short term, Chriss has said the two primary monetization levers are Venmo's debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance both online and offline, and Pay With Venmo, which provides a seamless way for customers to pay online. Monthly active accounts for the debit card grew more than 30% in 2024, and Pay with Venmo monthly actives increased more than 20%. The company added 8.8 million active accounts last year. One of Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. That product, dubbed Fastlane, launched in August, and is a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In 2024, branded checkout volume rose more than 6%, thanks in part to strength across large enterprise platforms. The other big product launch in 2024 was PayPal Everywhere, which went live in early September. The initiative offers 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. "The improvements we made to branded checkout, peer-to-peer, and Venmo, plus the progress we made on our price-to-value strategy, are beginning to show up in our results," Chriss said in the earnings statement. The company will hold an earnings call at 8:00 A.M. Eastern time. WATCH: PayPal's crypto lead on allowing merchants to buy and sell virtual assets Got a confidential news tip?

Volvo on Tuesday announced it was teaming up with Waabi, the self-driving truck startup backed by players like Nvidia (NVDA+2.77%) and Uber (UBER+7.97%), to jointly develop and deploy autonomous vehicles. The companies said they would integrate Waabi’s generative artificial intelligence-based technology into the trucks being developed by Volvo Autonomous Solutions, a unit of the Swedish luxury automaker. The trucks, Volvo’s VNL Autonomous, will be made at Volvo’s assembly plant in Virginia’s New River Valley. Testing is expected to begin later this year. “We are excited to integrate Waabi’s cutting-edge technology into our autonomous truck platform,” Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ chief product officer, Shahrukh Kazmi, said in a statement. Waabi CEO Raquel Urtasun said that “vertically integrating next-generation AI technology directly into an OEM’s vehicle production is the path forward” to making safe autonomous vehicles at scale. Last May, Waabi signed a multi-year lease on a trucking terminal in Dallas County, Texas, which will be the base for its operations in the state. The company first entered Texas in 2023, making trips between Dallas and Houston through its partnership with Uber Freight. It plans to expand testing in the state this year. In 2024, the company drew $200 million for its Series B funding round from investors such as Nvidia, Khosla Ventures, and Uber. Volvo has also invested in Waabi, participating in both the Series A and Series B rounds. Autonomous trucks have become an increasingly popular concept, potentially reducing the time it takes to transport goods and allowing companies to bypass the limitations of human workers. The industry is also mired in a debate over whether it has a shortage of human drivers or just difficulty retaining workers, largely thanks to long hours and poor wages. According to the consultancy McKinsey & Co., use cases for autonomous trucks could translate into a $616 billion global market in 2035. By that time, the U.S.’s autonomous heavy-duty trucking market could reach a roughly $178 billion valuation, with such vehicles accounting for 13% of all trucks on the road. Volvo has been working on autonomy for years, having developed an autonomous truck concept as early as 2017. A concept electric truck named Vera was unveiled in 2019 and put to work in a Swedish pilot program that year. Volvo has also partnered with Aurora Innovation (AUR-2.70%), a self-driving vehicle company based in Pittsburgh that works with several other companies, including Uber Freight and Continental. In May 2024, the companies debuted the VNL Autonomous at the ACT Expo in Las Vegas, describing the truck as a “purpose-designed and purpose-built” vehicle using Aurora’s hardware and software. In December, Volvo began hauling freight on autonomous trucks on two lanes, Dallas to Houston and Fort Worth to El Paso, as part of a partnership with DHL Supply Chain. Since the technology is still being tested, a safety driver is behind the wheel of those vehicles. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Salesforce is set to eliminate more than 1,000 positions as it enters its new fiscal year. According to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the job reductions coincide with ongoing hiring efforts to expand the company’s sales team for AI products. A source familiar with the matter told the news agency that affected employees would have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific departments impacted by the layoffs were not disclosed. Salesforce previously reported a total workforce of approximately 72,682 employees as of 31 January 2024. The firm has carried out multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year. In January 2024, Salesforce let go 700 of its employees, followed by an additional 300 in July. Despite the reductions, the cloud-based software firm continues to hire for AI-related roles. In particular, Salesforce has expanded its sales team to support Agentforce, an AI-powered virtual representative platform. CEO Marc Benioff announced in December 2024 that Salesforce had secured over 1,000 paid deals for the product, which automates tasks such as responding to customer inquiries and assessing potential sales opportunities. Salesforce’s enterprise cloud portfolio remains a key driver of revenue growth. The company’s data cloud and AI-driven tools, including Agentforce, have seen strong adoption among enterprise clients seeking to streamline workflows and manage large volumes of data. On its most recent earnings call, executives emphasised the role of Agentforce in the company’s strategy. Salesforce has been investing heavily in the platform’s expansion, with plans to hire 1,400 new employees in the fourth quarter to meet growing demand. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations in its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, released in December 2024. It reported $9.44bn in revenue for the quarter ending 31 October 2024, an 8% increase from the previous year. Salesforce raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $37.8bn to $38bn, slightly above its prior forecast. Earnings per share (EPS) projections were also revised upward to a range of $6.15 to $6.2. in addition, subscription and support revenue, which represents the bulk of the company’s income, increased by 9% YoY to $8.88bn. Operating cash flow surged 29% YoY to $1.98bn, while free cash flow rose 30% to $1.78bn. Salesforce is set to report fourth-quarter earnings later this month, which may provide further insight into its workforce strategy and AI expansion plans. The restructuring at Salesforce reflects the broader trend throughout the technology sector of companies restructuring their workforces in response to AI-driven changes and shifting business priorities. Over the past year, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all announced job cuts as they focus on emerging technologies and operational efficiencies.

Edoardo is a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, combining hands-on development expertise with a talent for technical communication. Through YouTube, Twitch, and … More about Edoardo ↬ Weekly tips on front-end & UX.Trusted by 200,000+ folks. This article has been kindly supported by our dear friends at Storyblok, a friendly headless CMS with a visual editor, nested components and customizable content blocks for websites and apps. Thank you! When computers first started talking to each other, the methods were remarkably simple. In the early days of the Internet, systems exchanged files via FTP or communicated via raw TCP/IP sockets. This direct approach worked well for simple use cases but quickly showed its limitations as applications grew more complex. The real breakthrough in enabling complex communication between computers on a network came with the introduction of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) in the 1980s. RPC allowed developers to call procedures on remote systems as if they were local functions, abstracting away the complexity of network communication. This pattern laid the foundation for many of the modern integration approaches we use today. Here’s a simplified example using Python’s XML-RPC. RPC can operate in both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous modes. Modern implementations such as gRPC support streaming and bi-directional communication. In the example below, we define a gRPC service called Calculator with two RPC methods, Calculate, which takes a Numbers message and returns a Result message, and CalculateStream, which sends a stream of Result messages in response. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) became the standard for enterprise integration, introducing a more structured approach to system communication. While SOAP provided robust enterprise features, its complexity, and verbosity led to the development of simpler alternatives, especially the REST APIs that dominate Web services communication today. But REST is not alone. Let’s have a look at some modern integration patterns. REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the de facto standard for Web APIs, providing a simple, stateless approach to manipulating resources. Its simplicity and HTTP-based nature make it ideal for web applications. First defined by Roy Fielding in 2000 as an architectural style on top of the Web’s standard protocols, its constraints align perfectly with the goals of the modern Web, such as performance, scalability, reliability, and visibility: client and server separated by an interface and loosely coupled, stateless communication, cacheable responses. In modern applications, the most common implementations of the REST protocol are based on the JSON format, which is used to encode messages for requests and responses. GraphQL emerged from Facebook’s internal development needs in 2012 before being open-sourced in 2015. Born out of the challenges of building complex mobile applications, it addressed limitations in traditional REST APIs, particularly the issues of over-fetching and under-fetching data. At its core, GraphQL is a query language and runtime that provides a type system and declarative data fetching, allowing the client to specify exactly what it wants to fetch from the server. Often used to build complex UIs with nested data structures, mobile applications, or microservices architectures, it has proven effective at handling complex data requirements at scale and offers a growing ecosystem of tools. Modern applications often require real-time updates. For example, e-commerce apps need to update inventory levels when a purchase is made, or content management apps need to refresh cached content when a document is edited. Traditional request-response models can struggle to meet these demands because they rely on clients’ polling servers for updates, which is inefficient and resource-intensive. Webhooks and event-driven architectures address these needs more effectively. Webhooks let servers send real-time notifications to clients or other systems when specific events happen. This reduces the need for continuous polling. Event-driven architectures go further by decoupling application components. Services can publish and subscribe to events asynchronously, and this makes the system more scalable, responsive, and simpler. This is a simple Node.js function that uses Fastify to set up a web server. It responds to the endpoint /webhook, checks the type field of the JSON request, and refreshes a cache if the event is of type content.published. With all this background information and technical knowledge, it’s easier to picture the current state of web application development, where a single, monolithic app is no longer the answer to business needs, but a new paradigm has emerged: Composable Architecture. This evolution has led us to the concept of composable architecture, where applications are built by combining specialized services. This is where headless CMS solutions have a clear advantage, serving as the perfect example of how modern integration patterns come together. Headless CMS platforms separate content management from content presentation, allowing you to build specialized frontends relying on a fully-featured content backend. This decoupling facilitates content reuse, independent scaling, and the flexibility to use a dedicated technology or service for each part of the system. Take Storyblok as an example. Storyblok is a headless CMS designed to help developers build flexible, scalable, and composable applications. Content is exposed via API, REST, or GraphQL; it offers a long list of events that can trigger a webhook. Editors are happy with a great Visual Editor, where they can see changes in real time, and many integrations are available out-of-the-box via a marketplace. Imagine this ContentDeliveryService in your app, where you can interact with Storyblok’s REST API using the open source JS Client: The last piece of the puzzle is a real example of integration. Again, many are already available in the Storyblok marketplace, and you can easily control them from the dashboard. However, to fully leverage the Composable Architecture, we can use the most powerful tool in the developer’s hand: code. Let’s imagine a modern e-commerce platform that uses Storyblok as its content hub, Shopify for inventory and orders, Algolia for product search, and Stripe for payments. Once each account is set up and we have our access tokens, we could quickly build a front-end page for our store. This isn’t production-ready code, but just to get a quick idea, let’s use React to build the page for a single product that integrates our services. First, we should initialize our clients: Given that we created a blok in Storyblok that holds product information such as the product_id, we could write a component that takes the productSlug, fetches the product content from Storyblok, the inventory data from Shopify, and some related products from the Algolia index: We could then set a simple component state: And return a template with all our data: We could then use an event-driven approach and create a server that listens to our shop events and processes the checkout with Stripe (credits to Manuel Spigolon for this tutorial): And with this approach, each service is independent of the others, which helps us achieve our business goals (performance, scalability, flexibility) with a good developer experience and a smaller and simpler application that’s easier to maintain. The integration between headless CMSs and modern web services represents the current and future state of high-performance web applications. By using specialized, decoupled services, developers can focus on business logic and user experience. A composable ecosystem is not only modular but also resilient to the evolving needs of the modern enterprise. These integrations highlight the importance of mastering API-driven architectures and understanding how different tools can harmoniously fit into a larger tech stack. In today’s digital landscape, success lies in choosing tools that offer flexibility and efficiency, adapt to evolving demands, and create applications that are future-proof against the challenges of tomorrow.

February 03, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA) Class Period: February 7, 2024 - November 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava’s leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Cassava class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SAVA MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Hundreds of Australian companies — from the Commonwealth Bank to Woolworths — will reveal how much money they have earned (or lost) over the past six to 12 months, as the biannual reporting season unfolds. There is no doubt company chief executives will be peppered with questions about what the future holds. But the problem is it might be hard for these highly paid bosses to provide much guidance, particularly with the unpredictability coming from the White House. Many had thought that Donald Trump's long-standing threats to introduce tariffs against America's biggest trading partners were a negotiation tactic. So the US President's decision to actually start a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China caught many by surprise — as evidenced by the hefty falls across global share markets, and the Australian dollar sinking to a five-year low. "I think in the short term, the implications are significant," said Gemma Dale, head of investor behaviour at NabTrade. Gemma Dale says there's a risk of tech stocks reporting disappointing results. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "The risk is that Trump is not as predictable as previous [US] administrations have been, so it's very difficult to make predictions about how the market is going perform for the rest of the year, given he's already shocked us multiple times in the past week or two." However, there are some fund managers who are feeling optimistic about the markets, despite the volatility that Mr Trump has unleashed with his tariff announcements. Tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump may not be a surprise, but they've certainly caused a shock on financial markets. Analysts say correction (a decline of of at least 10 per cent from the previous peak) on equity markets is now looking more likely. "At the moment, it's very hard to see the real long-term impact, and it's too early to even be thinking about the secondary impacts on inflation," said Jun Bei Liu, lead portfolio manager at Ten Cap. "That's because he [Trump] imposed this very quickly, and he's given himself time to change his mind. "I think this creates a lot of opportunity for investors, for some of the higher-quality companies if they get sold off." Although resource stocks are expected to come under pressure — due to their exposure to China's economy — Ms Liu believes the overall share market will keep rising for the rest of the year as interest rates start to fall in Australia. Jun Bei Liu expects the ASX to perform well this year despite the risks. (ABC News: John Gunn) At this stage, money markets are betting there is a 96 per cent chance of the Reserve Bank slashing interest rates at its 17-18 February meeting, followed by two more cuts by Christmas. And in a rare display of unanimity, economists from the "big four" banks (CBA, Westpac, NAB and ANZ) are predicting the RBA will announce that eagerly awaited rate reduction in two weeks. These coming weeks will be a good opportunity for investors to work out how well companies are performing — and whether they are paying too much for their shares. Despite Monday's tumble, the local share market is still trading near record highs. In general, if a company's results (and guidance about future profits) is better than expected, it leads to more people buying their stock — which drives up the share price. But if their results fall below what market analysts are expecting, it can lead to a sell-off for the company in more extreme cases. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some of the common jargon and has a calendar of all the key dates. "One of the key questions for investors will be, Is there going to be earnings growth for the Australian share market?'" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell. "And that's important because valuations are relatively high. "If we look at what happened in 2024, we actually saw earnings going backwards by about 4 per cent, and yet the Australian share market grew by 7.5 per cent. "That's not a sustainable trend when you're paying high multiples and high valuations." Ms Lee said shareholders wanted to see the companies they were invested in growing, which meant the lack of earnings growth was a problem. "This reporting season it will be all about whether we see upgrades to the outlook to help support those lofty valuations that we're seeing here on the Australian market." Julia Lee says gold miners may benefit from trade uncertainty. (The Business) Here is a table showing the price-to-earnings ratios of the ASX 200, and the various sectors which make up the share market (from most expensive to cheapest): At the upper end of the spectrum, people have been willing to pay high amounts of money (a share price 146.8 times the current earnings per share) for shares in local tech companies — as they have lofty expectations those businesses will develop new products and grow their profits rapidly in the future. On the flip side, a sharp fall in commodity prices last year have led to shares of BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside Energy and similar companies tumbling. Their profits are determined largely by how much their iron ore, oil, nickel and lithium can be sold for. So that is why the price-to-earnings ratios for the energy (11.2x) and materials (13.7x) sectors are lower compared to the broader market (19.9x). "There's a handful of companies in Australia where the price-to-earnings ratio is just extraordinarily high," Ms Dale said. Mexico and Canada have vowed to impose their own taxes on billions of dollars of trade with their closest neighbour. "You'd want to look very closely at the tech sector, in particular, where you've got companies like WiseTech Global and Xero on P/Es of more than 115 times. So those are very, very rich valuations. "They've grown very quickly and they continue to surprise to the upside generally. "But when you've got companies that are priced so well, and you're expecting that kind of dramatic growth quite a long way into the future, if there's any surprise — even if it's only marginally negative — or they don't live up to expectations, you can see a real, quite dramatic price response to that can be really disappointing." Australian banks are also looking quite expensive by this measure (with CBA commanding a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8x). "Investors don't mind paying up as long as they get that [earnings] growth," Ms Lee said. "However, if we have a look at the banks' cash profits, they're forecast to contract 2 per cent [this year], which is a consensus view, and contract by another 1 per cent next year. "So the earnings outlook does look more difficult. And we know that people are doing it tough, paying off mortgages, so asset quality also comes into the picture as well." The three analysts and fund managers we spoke to revealed what they were watching in the February reporting season. Here are some of the trends they are looking out for: CBA is the world's most expensive bank, on its price to earnings ratio. (ABC News: Christopher Gillette) The biggest risk that most analysts are worried about is the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's policies — and the extent to which countries retaliate against US tariffs. With widespread tariffs (in a worst-case scenario), it could lead to the price of consumer goods becoming a lot more expensive across the globe, which could lead to inflation rising again (or not falling as quickly). That could lead to central banks (such as the RBA, US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank) announcing fewer rate cuts than had been expected. That would likely lead to the stock market, which was expecting rate cuts, to suffer heavy falls or even a correction — that is, a fall of at least 10 per cent from its most recent peak. "If inflation picks up again, and if we have interest rates moving higher, then it will challenge the investment thesis, making a lot of businesses and retailers struggle," Ms Liu said, adding the odds of that happening were low. "Consumers will falter and corporate earnings would struggle. "That is probably one of the biggest potential risks to the market." Disclaimer: This article is not intended as investment advice.

Full Content:
February 3, 2025 12:07 PM PT Every year we ask a collection of writers, editors, developers, podcasters, and other people for their opinions about how Apple fared in the year just gone by. You can read our 2024 report card for the average scores and some juicy quotes. But if you want to read the whole thing—all 32,000 words of it—who are we to stand in your way? They wrote it, you read it. That’s how this works. Onward. How would you rate how the Mac platform went in 2024? Consider new Mac models, new chips, new macOS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Eric Linder: I have an M1 MacBook Pro, and the M4 looks delicious, but I’m going to wait one more year. I don’t have a vote per se, but I do like that Apple is updating the Mac lineup on a much more regular basis than in previous “times.” Benjamin Mayo: The M4 chip continues to show Apple’s silicon supremacy, posting impressive year-over-year gains. I was particularly glad to see the M4 Pro chip core configuration pivot away from last year’s weirdness and return to a beefy performance-tuned chip. The Mac mini got its long-deserved time in the sun with a nice update and chassis redesign, alongside decent spec bumps for the iMac and MacBook Pro. Also, a really welcome surprise was the bump to 16 GB RAM as the base spec for all models, including the ‘old but still sold’ M2 and M3 Airs. As far as macOS is concerned, I use iPhone Mirroring a lot and found it to be a stable and enjoyable affair. Roman Loyola: It sure feels like Apple took the criticism of the base M3 MacBook Pro to heart, and that’s why Apple made the changes it did, but I guess we’ll never know. Regardless, the upgrades were very satisfying. Glenn Fleishman: Apple keeps ticking over with new processors and models filling out and updating their matrix. Generally, they are delivering solid, often exceptional performance per dollar. In a year with both M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro updates and M4 and M4 Pro Mac minis in a new form factor, it’s hard to pick too many nits. But I think the iMac is way overdue for a 27-inch model, the Mac Studio lacked a refresh, and I have no idea what the company thinks the Mac Pro is for. I wish I could split Mac into two categories: how well are they keeping things going (such as finally removing the 8 GB low-end configuration), and how well they are introducing new features and form factors that are in demand (like the cuteness but also power and utility of the new Mac mini). I can’t give Apple a five on hardware for those reasons, but I also think macOS is at a point of confusion. The introduction of Apple Intelligence in waves and without having tentpole features that solve problems (across all platforms) is absolutely mystifying. I have new-enough Macs to take advantage of all AI features and I honestly find them mostly useful. Apple even replaced a perfectly good touch-up feature in Photos for macOS with an AI-based one that has worse performance and is in beta. This removed functionality people relied on. However, I’m a huge fan of a probably uncovered set of features I’ve written about in my books: screen mirroring and sharing. It’s dramatically better in every direction. Screen Sharing between Macs now works reliably for me; with iPhones and iPads, there’s a new and better approach; Mac to Apple TV offers more options and is far superior; Mac into videoconferencing, particularly FaceTime, much better; and the iPhone Mirroring app is a big bonus integration. Screen sharing/mirroring are boring areas that some people use intensively and others not at all; Apple’s improvements show that they can pay attention to the little things and provide integrated, upgraded, seamless OS features! Eric Slivka: The Mac mini redesign is a treat, while the overdue bump to 16GB of memory across the board was very welcome. Otherwise, nice to see the steady chip progression, though some will undoubtedly be disappointed at the higher-end machines skipping the M3 generation. macOS Sequoia has some nice improvements, though it has had a few hiccups along the way, and we’re still waiting on some of the promised features amid Apple’s gradual rollout. Brett Terpstra: The M4 lineup is top-notch. I’ve been using an M1 Studio for a while now, and moving up to the M4 was a bigger performance leap than I expected. I’m anxious to see the Studio lineup get upgraded, but the M4 Mac mini has an amazing bang/buck ratio, and the M4 MacBook Pro has me very satisfied with my purchase. Dave Hamilton: Great to see the MacBook Air get the M3 chip and continue to see love from Apple. I also love that the MacBook Air has become the default model for so many people, including professionals. Folks seem to have (finally?) accepted that it’s not only OK to live in a world of dongles, but it’s better because we each get to choose the ports that matter where they matter. Need one thing at your desk but different options when you travel? Great! You’ve got it. Also nice to see the “Pro” machines (iMac and MacBook Pro) get the M4 chip where it’s needed. I’ve (finally?) gotten over the fact that Apple won’t be making iMacs with screens large enough for me to use on a daily basis, but ViewSonic’s soon-to-be-released 27″ 5K Thunderbolt Display is an easy, $799 solution to that problem when paired with the new Mac mini, which is definitely the lede I’ve buried here. That thing is a beast and is the right computer for so many people who work on their Macs at their desks. What a fantastic upgrade! David Sparks: Apple Silicon Macs remain some of the best hardware Apple is shipping. I’m satisfied with the pace of improvement and the product line as a whole. If, however, I was someone at that top end of the performance curve, I’d be sad. I can’t help but feel there is an alternative universe where the Mac Pro has a chip that is so fast that it comes with a warning label—just not this one. Lex Friedman: I want every new Mac. Apple is crushing it with the Mac. I can’t believe how great every new Mac is. I feel like a fanboy when I write these words, but seriously, the state of the Mac today is exceptional. Craig Hockenberry: Here’s the thing: over the years, I’ve become less eager to upgrade my Macs to the latest version of macOS. I’m still using Sonoma on all my Macs and will only move to the new version when I’m forced to by a system requirement (that’s most likely to be Xcode). The main cause for lagging behind is all of the annoyances that come with each new version. I’m really tired of all the new security prompts, odd bugs from incomplete testing, and UI weirdness from designers and developers whose primary focus is iOS. It’s a shame the software is in this state because the Mac hardware has never been better. My MacBook Air is the best computer I have ever owned, and the whole product lineup is great (yes, even with the outrageous incremental costs for storage and memory). Marco Arment: It’s a great time to be a Mac user. The hardware is the best it has ever been, with nearly every need met with multiple great choices. macOS remains mostly good, due largely to neglect, but that’s better than today’s Apple touching it very much. Myke Hurley: The M4 was a really nice continued advancement of the power behind the Mac line. We got great laptop updates and a welcome simplification for the MacBook Air. However it would have been nice to get some clarity over the future of the Mac Studio. Matt Deatherage: The low end sees massive improvements, but the high desktop end seems more than ever like a status item for the one percent. Kirk McElhearn: A solid year for Macs, with M4 processors across much of the line and the attractive new Mac mini. This said, with the exception of the Mac mini, there’s no real innovation in new Macs; they’re all just upgrades of previous models. Maybe we don’t need anything different? But where is the Mac Pro, and what about a larger iMac? I don’t want one—I’m happy with the 24″—but I know many people who do. The lack of an upgrade to the Studio Display is a bit surprising, and Apple seems to have, once again, given up on caring about displays. The bump to 16 GB on all new Macs at no price increase underscores the fact that this extra memory is not worth $200, and is a reminder that we have been paying this Apple tax for years, since we can’t add RAM to Macs anymore. Stephen Hackett: As we round out the fourth year of the Apple Silicon Era, the Mac is truly firing on all cylinders. Modern Mac notebooks are incredible; even my new M4 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro runs silently and boasts shockingly good battery life. While I could have never had a notebook-only setup during the Intel days, I’ve done just that for several years with no complaints. The one ding on the hardware front is that the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are stuck on M2-based SoCs. It’s clear that the process used for the M3 was a bit of a dead-end and that an M3 Ultra wasn’t in the cards, but Apple’s two high-end desktops using old silicon is a bit embarrassing. On the software front, macOS Sequoia brought my favorite macOS feature in years, which was the iPhone Mirroring. I use it daily to access iPhone-only apps while sitting at my desk. I’m thrilled that Apple continues to find new ways to tighten the integration between the Mac and the iPhone without turning the former into the latter. Peter Cohen: I’d never have picked the M4 Mac mini to be the MVP, but it’s like the Genie from Aladdin: PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER! (Itty bitty living space.) Chance Miller: It’s pretty hard to complain about the Mac these days. The new Mac mini is another example of Apple flexing its design muscles in the Apple silicon era. The biggest change of the year, however, was Apple doubling the RAM in the base MacBook Air from 8GB to 16 GB. Bonus points for not raising the price and backdating the change to the M2 configuration as well. My only complaint semi-related to the Mac? We need new external display options. It’s time, Apple. Brent Simmons: The Current Mac UI design—both in terms of how it works and how it looks—could be improved. Nick Heer: The farther down you look on the Mac price list in 2024, the better the year was. The new Mac Mini is a tremendous value, as is the Walmart-exclusive M1 MacBook Air. Every Mac sold by Apple now has a (long-overdue) baseline of 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. As prices increase, though, the Mac is more of a mixed bag. The MacBook Air did not get Apple’s latest architecture despite updates to the Mac Mini and iMac, which share the same core parts. The MacBook Pro was updated, but the Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and Apple’s displays were not. MacOS Sequoia is fine. iPhone Screen Mirroring is useful, but Apple Intelligence is a mixed bag. Why is Writing Tools in an easy-to-accidentally-dismiss popover? Notifications are still buggy, and security prompts are out of control. Federico Viticci: Look, as we’ve established, I can now use my iPad Pro for everything I do and don’t need a Mac in my life. But I think Apple is doing an outstanding job with its Mac lineup, and I’m particularly envious of those who own the new Mac mini, which is small, powerful, and just exceedingly cute. I would give this category five stars; I don’t because Apple still insists on not making touchscreen Macs or more interesting and weird form factors. Shelly Brisbin: Apple’s Mac updates this year were solid but also satisfying. The ease with which M4 versions of the MacBook Pro and iMac entered the lineup says a lot about how well Apple’s hardware designs can carry forward for multiple years but leave room for the kind of performance improvements enthusiasts expect. The new Mac mini, though fans of the diminutive form factor impatiently anticipated it, was a big hit when it arrived, bringing plenty of power – and value – in a solid hardware package. More M4s are coming in 2025, surely. From a fan’s perspective, I enjoy the gradual, dare I say, thoughtful pace of updates. Rich Mogull: Between chip updates and the new Mac mini, Apple is firing on all cylinders. Michael Tsai: The M4 Macs have some virtualization, display, and USB issues, but overall the updates seem seem strong. I’m particularly excited about the MacBook Pro’s nanotexture display. The Mac input devices are finally USB-C, but they got the most minimal of updates, not fixing the Magic Mouse’s charging point or modernizing the globe key’s location on the extended keyboard. Unfortunately, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are still using M2 processors. SSD pricing is still ridiculous, and the software side is still a mess, both in terms of reliability and design. I have not found the Apple Intelligence features very useful. Probably the most exciting things for me in Sequoia are the new Passwords app and the new window management features, though in both cases I prefer third-party solutions. Dan Moren: Look, the Mac continues to have one of its best runs ever. Apple redesigned the Mac mini (the Mac mini!) for the first time in almost fifteen years, making it even smaller and putting ports on the front—a home run. If the Mac suffers from anything these days, it’s that the hardware seems so good that it’s hard to imagine how Apple can continue to improve it. Jeff Carlson: The Mac lineup seemed to find a groove and stick to it in 2024. Aside from the smaller size and greater power of the Mac mini, it’s felt like a transition to bigger, later things, especially at the high end. In fact, I’d say Apple has hobbled itself slightly with the M-series processors, particularly from a consumer point of view: the MacBook Pro has an M4, but the Mac Studio and Mac Pro still have an M2. Yes, there are Maxes and Ultras, and likely, the person buying those machines knows the differences, but it’s still not as solid of a pitch as Apple can do. All that said, the Mac remains solid. Casey Liss: There is nearly nothing to complain about with the Mac — when it comes to regular people, anyway. The new Mac mini is adorable, powerful, and affordable. The laptops remain incredible; the Air is great for most people and, for Apple, affordable. The MacBook Pro is overkill for many, but it remains a truly phenomenal machine. Several years into the Apple Silicon transition, I am still amazed I can have the modern equivalent of iMac Pro performance in a machine that I can easily carry with me, and use without being connected to power for hours. Arguably, the one indisputably great thing to come from Apple Intelligence is the VERY, VERY LONG, OVERDUE increase in RAM across the Mac lineup. Andy Ihnatko: The Mac lineup feels like an impressive, cohesive “collection” now (to dip back into my “Project Runway” super fandom days). I’m going to single out the Mac Mini for special love. The cheapest ticket to the Mac lineup is a perfect introduction to everything Apple does well. Howard Oakley: Generally a very good year, with some great highlights, and relatively few gaffes. James Thomson: The new Mac mini is delightful, though definitely not cheap at higher specs. More niche hardware like the Mac Studio still hasn’t seen any updates in a while. Adam Engst: The M4 Macs are brilliant. John Gruber: The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years, and now, even better, seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. I am especially pleased—borderline ecstatic—regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150. (They don’t even charge more for the option on the larger 16-inch models.) The only hitch in the lineup is the Macs Apple hasn’t been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro have remained unchanged since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC’s first-generation 3nm process and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC. MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release. Reliable and familiar. Jessica Dennis: One wonders what Apple could have been doing instead of spending person-hours building a bunch of AI stuff that doesn’t seem particularly good or useful into MacOS. Mac hardware quality continues to be excellent, and lucky for me, I fall into one of the well-supported niches (i.e., I buy a new laptop every five years or so, and it’s fine). However, I’ve definitely seen the genuine angst some folks have about product upgrade cycles. Michael Gartenberg: The Mac has been pretty stable, and that’s not a bad thing; the M series of processors has delivered well for users. Unfortunately, for many users, there’s no reason to upgrade from their M1 or M2 to jump on the latest devices. The new Mac mini is a great device but creates confusion in the line relative to devices like the Studio devices, making it challenging for high-end users to figure out what devices are for them. Apple also finally acknowledges that perhaps 8 GB of RAM isn’t enough for users, which is good because Apple’s prices for both RAM and storage upgrades are absurd. Apple either needs to find a new supplier for memory and storage, make these things upgradeable, or stop gouging customers. Carolina Milanesi: Apple Silicon continued to be the purchase driver for the Mac. Market share in Enterprise is growing, offering Apple a new opportunity to penetrate a space that has mostly been BYOD in the past. The broad range of price points and computing power offers Apple the ability to have a low entry point and go all the way to a workstation competitor. Christina Warren: Man. What a great year for the Mac. Four years on, Apple silicon continues to impress. The much-touted Apple Intelligence might be a bust, but it forced Apple to finally give every Mac 16GB of RAM. RAM and storage upgrade pricing continue to be war crimes — but at least every Mac has 16GB of RAM now. The base model M4 Mac mini is one of the most compelling and best-value Apple products we’ve seen, probably since the venerable M1 MacBook Air. I wish it had more storage, but it shows that Apple can actually offer a compelling product priced under the competition for its performance. The MacBook Air would’ve been a push update for me but then Apple had to up the RAM even in the M2 models for the Apple Intelligence launch. I got a great deal on a 13″ M3 with 16GB of RAM for my mom that wipes the floor with anything priced that way in Windows Land — x86 or Qualcomm. The M4 chips look like real winners. I won’t be replacing my maxed-out 2023 14″ M3 Max, but I hope we get a Mac Studio this spring so I can harness some of that power. The Studio and the Mac Pro are the unloved children. But that’s fine. As a desktop devotee, even I’ve accepted that Apple is a notebook company that occasionally makes desktops and, about once a decade, releases a mini PC so compelling that it’ll act as my home server for the next decade. macOS is not as good as it used to be. I hate the new UAC stuff for screen capture, and the settings menu is the worst. But compared to our friends in Windows land (to say nothing of our Linux compatriots, steam notwithstanding) dealing with Recall drama, it’s a good time to be a Mac user. And as Simon Willison noted, Apple Intelligence might be hot garbage (OK, I editorialized the hot garbage bit), but MLX is great. And despite Nvidia being a behemoth, Apple machines are great for doing local AI development. It was just an unbelievable year for the Mac. Andrew Laurence: The M4 generation looks to be one of leveling up across the product line. More like this, please. Zac Hall: Good riddance, 8GB RAM. You simply don’t have enough memory to be missed. Matt Birchler: It might be too bold, but I wonder if the Mac lineup is as good as it’s ever been in Apple’s history. Name a bad computer in the lineup; I don’t think you can. Exciting new form factors would be great to see, and macOS could always improve, but if we don’t call the Mac great right now, then I don’t know when it will be great. Shahid Kamal Ahmad: The M4 line of chips feels like the first justifiable upgrade opportunity for those who jumped in with the M1. Where the M2 and M3 were decent but still just incremental upgrades, the M4 is a powerhouse. I’m disappointed that the black MacBook Pro is not a true black, but that’s truly petty given that there still doesn’t seem to be any other computer that comes close to offering the Mac’s astonishing quality, performance, and power, not to mention that it still beats everything else for style and convenience. The dark days of the Mac seem to be a fading memory now. Long may this continue. Allison Sheridan: Who would have thought the Mac mini would lead the excitement for 2024 with the M4 Pro? The other across-the-board advancement was making all entry-level Macs come with 16GB/256GG, which was a win all around. Brian Mattucci: While the migration to M4 is going as expected, and the Mac Mini redesign is a positive, the long wait for the Mac Studio with the latest Apple silicon continues to feel illogical when the model they’re selling is now two generations behind and will likely be nearly three generations behind by the time they finally update it. Quinn Nelson: The M4 took everyone by surprise. From its unexpected debut on the iPad to delivering process gains far beyond expectations, it was hands-down Apple’s star of 2024. And the new Mac mini? Seriously—how could you not love it? Adorable! Paul Kafasis: Mac hardware is really looking good, with frequent updates. MacOS updates have been good, though there’s a lot of churn going on, and features coming in 15.1, 15.2, and beyond, is somewhat bothersome. Can Apple get off of the annual OS update cycle yet? John Siracusa: The M4 chip series is the best since the M1. The single-core performance and power efficiency are both great, which is important for the low-core-count M-series chips that most people buy. The uncertainty surrounding the “big” desktop Macs and the chips that will power them continues to be a problem, however. I was happy to see the base RAM in Macs increase to 16 GB this year. Call it the Apple Intelligence Dividend. Ironically, this is also the year that Apple’s absurdly high pricing for RAM and storage upgrades—which definitely continued in 2024—has gotten a bit more widespread attention. I’m not sure if it will change anything, but something has to give. Consider the new M4 Mac mini. It’s impossible to build a PC that is as powerful as the base M4 mini for the same amount of money. But as soon as you add any kind of upgrade from the base specs, the M4 mini completely loses its value lead—often by a lot. I’ve calculated that Apple’s storage upgrades are now 6.5x higher than retail market prices for the same size and performance. Ridiculous. Philip Michaels: The move to Apple silicon continues to pay dividends. It’s probably the smartest thing Apple’s done in years. Steven Aquino: I feel like the Mac is firing on all cylinders right now, thanks in large part to Apple silicon. While my daily driver machine is a 2019 Retina 4K iMac on Intel—I do have an M2 MacBook Air as well—the value proposition is off the charts, seeing it still going strong nearly 6 years after I bought it. How would you rate how the iPhone and iOS platform went in 2024? Consider new hardware, new chips, OS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Paul Kafasis: The iPhone seems strong, and iOS 18 had some good updates. Interestingly, though, this is the first year since 2008 that I didn’t get a new iPhone. The hardware update just wasn’t that compelling to me, in part because my iPhone 15 Pro is Apple Intelligence compatible. David Sparks: The iPhone is what it needs to be: a solid platform that sells billions of units per year. However, I wish Apple had continued the mini for folks who prefer something smaller. I’d also like to see them take a few more risks with a non-flagship model, which may be the aim of the rumored iPhone Air. But if the rumors are true, it doesn’t sound like a big enough risk to me. Casey Liss: I could have made a case for a five, but for this year, I think four is more appropriate. While I mostly like the Camera Control, I think it’s too fiddly by half. A few months in, I suspect I would have preferred a dumb shutter button to the fancy touch-sensitive setup that we actually got. I am overjoyed to return to a human-sized phone from the 15 Pro Max I had last year, but even the regular-sized phones are large enough that I didn’t give up my PopSocket—#mykewasright. I’m also getting sick and tired of the Pro phones having absurdly boring colors. Apple, it won’t take away from the other Pro models to have fun colors. Offer the boring ones of today, as well as some fun ones… PLEASE! The non-Pro colors are SO GOOD this year; I’d probably pay a bit more to have that blue in a Pro phone. Marco Arment: iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 family are almost universally great. My only (minor) complaint is the Camera Control button, an overthought, finicky, error-prone engineering indulgence that actually can be pretty useful, but only once most of its functionality is turned off. Benjamin Mayo: Apple delivered about as much as you can reasonably expect for an ‘iteration’ year of the iPhone. The base models represent really good value this year, with only a couple of minor details separating them from the Pro lines. I think the Camera Control was a bit of a miss; it’s fine as a shutter button, but all of the gestural stuff feels like a gimmick, given its current implementation. The sheer number of settings to change its behavior is laughable and perhaps speaks to a need for Apple to give it a second look and strip it back to what is really most useful. Apple Intelligence may still be rolling out in a piecemeal fashion, but I find features like the email summaries and improved photo search to meaningfully improve the iOS experience. Jessica Dennis: The iPhone continues to be solidly Good, if unexciting. Apple may have been shocked that no one was particularly interested in upgrading their phone just for the new Apple Intelligence features, but very few other people were (myself included). I get a new phone annually because of the Apple Upgrade program, and that’s the only reason. For the past couple of years, I haven’t had a use case for a Pro model. And I miss the iPhone Mini so much. Dave Hamilton: I was stoked that Apple Intelligence essentially forced Apple to make the base model iPhone 16 almost as powerful as the iPhone 16 Pro. This truly gives people options and, of course, allows everyone getting a new iPhone this year to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. Adam Engst: Having the Action button and Camera Control on all iPhone 16 models is great, but otherwise, the iPhone 16 lineup doesn’t seem to be much of an improvement over previous models. And while I know it’s boring to complain about the lack of a smaller iPhone, I also field non-stop complaints from people who want one and aren’t upgrading from the iPhone SE because of that. Rich Mogull: The iPhone 16 and 16 Pro are solid updates, and the non-Pro has really stepped up the value proposition. I’m mixed on the new Camera Control; even though I use it a lot for zoom, I still don’t have a good handle on making it work like I want. The response is just a bit off. iOS 18 is a good start, but Apple Intelligence isn’t quite there yet. Maybe in 18.4. John Gruber: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Nothing has been broke regarding the iPhone lineup, and Apple hasn’t tried to fix anything. This is good. Changes for the sake of change are the surest sign of a company in decline. Stagnation and hubris are concerns for any wildly successful product, but it takes confidence to let great design speak for itself without making facile, unnecessary changes. Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I’d like to see the actual button improve (I think it’s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays, and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models. iOS 18 is refined, mature, and familiar. Joe Rosensteel: The hardware is the best iPhone hardware they’ve ever shipped. The software promises Apple is making around Apple Intelligence aren’t compelling, and Apple didn’t deliver on them in 2024. Camera Control is a mess, but it doesn’t impair phone usage. People should really take a step back and think through the headline features because they were anything but. The new, editable Photographic Styles have had a bigger impact on my life than any other 2024 feature. Michael Gartenberg: Someone at Apple forgot that it’s _under_promise and _over_deliver, not the other way around. iPhone 16 was sold on the basis of Apple Intelligence, which wasn’t present at the launch, it took two releases to bring some of the promised features, and when they failed, Apple removed them as opposed to fixing them. Siri remains far behind Google and Samsung in terms of AI features that actually do something. The good news is iPhone 15 users don’t feel nearly as bad for not getting Apple AI on their devices, and they can use things like Gemini or Copilot for their AI fix. I do give them credit, as they promised a glow effect and delivered on that rather nicely. I am not a fan of the camera button. It feels like it’s in the wrong place, and it’s kind of hard for me to use; the volume button works fine for me. I was kind of baffled when Tim said that email summaries were a game changer for him, making me wonder if he gets very little email or uses some other AI for his email summaries. Matt Birchler: The iPhone is still the best phone for me, but 2024 definitely felt like an off year to me. I think the iPhone 16 is a good update, but the 16 Pro line is a real miss in my book. I’d actually pay more to get a 16 Pro that didn’t have the Camera Control button because it’s turned into a button that I exclusively use on accident and never on purpose. I still use the Action Button to launch and use my camera because it feels better to me. Also, Apple Intelligence really put a stink on this whole year for the iPhone, as seemingly very few other software features were added, and the few Apple Intelligence features we’ve gotten have arrived later than hoped for and have been almost universally underwhelming. Andy Ihnatko: The iPhone 16 is the same old dish, prepared with fresh ingredients. That’s all that Apple was prepared to release this year. It’s fine: a solid 3/5. I have to deduct a full point for Apple Intelligence. Most of these features are as squirrelly as everybody should have expected: no more, no less. I expect Apple Intelligence to improve after this first round of users provides a galaxy of training data. But Apple chose to roll these features into the mainstream iPhone OS and promote them as if they were finished features, so I have to factor that in. Carolina Milanesi: Solid hardware, but Apple Intelligence was a bit of a letdown. Brian Mattucci: 2024 was all about the slow trickle of Apple Intelligence features of uncertain value. Some features (Image Playground and especially Genmoji) were interesting at first, but they feel like they’re years away from being reliable and useful. I was a big fan of notification summaries at first, but I’ve seen enough errors at this point to no longer trust them. I turned off the mail categorization feature almost immediately. I love the Home Screen and Control Center customization options – they’re the highlights of iOS 18 for me. As for hardware, adding the camera control button makes some sense, though I don’t use any of the features beyond launching the Camera app – it just doesn’t feel precise enough. Eric Linder: The iPhone is a fully mature product at this point, and sometimes, I struggle to think of new features that might be implemented. One criticism I have is that Apple seems to continue to sell the iPhone 16 line based on the promises of future features (I’m looking at you, not-so-intelligent-Apple-Intelligence). Even when the iPhone 16 was launched, commercials seemed to appear everywhere that used Siri app intents and context awareness, both of which are STILL not available even to iOS 18.3 beta users. Roman Loyola: I usually upgrade to a Pro Max, but this time, I opted for the 16 Plus, and I’m happy with it. Until I start making “cinema,” I may not get a Pro phone again. Steven Aquino: The iPhone impresses every year in my eyes. I upgrade it every year not merely for journalism’s sake but because it’s my most important and oft-used computer. Jeff Carlson: I want to give this a 3.5 because overall, the iPhone is in good shape; the 16 series is good, but despite the technological complexity and ingenuity of the Camera Control on the 16 Pro, in practice, it just doesn’t work as well as it should. It’s too finicky and, most important, often doesn’t do what you expect it to do. Dr. Drang: The Camera Control is possibly the worst Apple UI device since the hockey puck mouse. There’s a reason no real camera manufacturer recesses their shutter button. Depressing a recessed button is a recipe for both shaking (as you’ve complained about) and tilting. Worse is how the photographic styles shift for seemingly no reason. I know I must be sliding my finger on the button, but I’m trying not to. It’s too sensitive and keeps making changes I don’t want. I should say “kept” instead of “keeps.” I’ve changed the Camera Control to open Magnifier, and I now use the Acton button to open the Camera. It’s much less frustrating. Dan Moren: The iPhone is great and continues to be great. But this year’s focus on Apple Intelligence is disappointing and sucked a lot of the air out of the room when it came to actual feature improvements that people want. I still use Camera Control, but I think a lot of its extra features, beyond opening/taking pictures and video, are clunky and not useful. It feels a bit like the company is struggling to find opportunities to improve what has become an increasingly mature product category. Eric Slivka: The iterative updates continue as we wait for some bolder changes from Apple. I love the colors on this year’s standard iPhones but I continue to hope for some better options on the Pro side. I’ve struggled and failed to embrace Camera Control, and even in the second year for Pro users, I’ve not found a lot of value in the Action button. On the software side, Apple Intelligence is obviously the big thing, but we’re only barely dipping our toes into it so far. The verdict is yet to come, but so far, it’s been underwhelming. Craig Hockenberry: Apple Intelligence is underwhelming, especially with Siri. It also feels like a lot of engineering resources were directed toward features that no one asked for and can’t really trust. But again, the hardware is stellar. And the “intelligence” does have an upside: more memory in our pockets. Kirk McElhearn: It’s all about Apple Intelligence this year, and limiting these features to only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models feels like an attempt to force a super cycle, which doesn’t seem to be occurring. I upgraded from an iPhone 14 Pro, and honestly feel that I could have kept my 14 a year longer. I’ve heard from plenty of non-tech people that they simply don’t care about Apple Intelligence, and they see no need to upgrade phones that work just fine. Shelly Brisbin: Like the Mac, the iPhone platform moved ahead incrementally in 2024 if evaluated year-over-year. But the base on which this year’s updates stand is solid enough to offer tempting upgrades to almost anyone who has kept their phone for more than a year. I feel good about the division of features between Pro and non-Pro phones. If an advanced camera system is irresistible, you can have it. But bringing hardware features like the Action Button and Dynamic Island to the full line of new phones is friendly to all kinds of users. The most disappointing aspect of this year’s phones is Camera Control, which attempts to pack a lot of punch into one hardware button but remains confusing to use. iOS is frankly weighed down by the simultaneously glacial pace, and forcible implementation, of Apple Intelligence. From a business perspective, Apple had to build AI into its platforms this year, and the iPhone is where that’s unavoidably apparent. But there have been bugs and poorly implemented offerings, and despite the emphasis on Apple Intelligence in the ads, it’s unclear to me why a buyer would choose Apple’s version of AI over another. I like the tabby cat playing the guitar that I sent to my friend yesterday, but even he isn’t a killer iPhone app. Chance Miller: I tried really hard to use the Camera Control to its full potential with all the various swipe and half-press features. The reality is it’s most useful as a way to launch the Camera app and take a picture. Nothing more. Otherwise, the iPhone 16 Pro models are a stellar upgrade. The battery life continues to impress me on a daily basis. The non-Pro phones are more enticing than they’ve ever been. Oh, and RIP FineWoven. I wish Apple had replaced it with something better, but at least it’s dead. Federico Viticci: It’s been an interesting year in iPhone land for me. After the September event, I purchased an iPhone 16 Pro Max, but my mind kept going to the iPhone 16 Plus. I was fascinated by its color, slimmer form factor, and more affordable overall package. I used the iPhone 16 Plus as my primary phone for two months and loved it, but then something happened: much to my surprise, I realized that I wasn’t taking as many pictures of my dogs, friends, and family as I used to with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. That’s when it hit me. I thought I wouldn’t need all the features of a “pro” phone – and, honestly, since I’m not a professional cinematographer, I really don’t – but in the end, I was missing the 5x camera too much. In my experience with using a 16 Plus, I was able to confirm that, if I wanted, I could live without a ProMotion display. But it was the lack of a third, zoomed camera on the Plus model that ultimately got me. I rely on the 5x lens to take dozens of pictures of my dogs doing something funny or sleeping in a cute way every day, and its absence on the 16 Plus was preventing me from grabbing my phone out of my pocket to save new memories on a daily basis. I’m glad I did this experiment because it also left me with a couple of additional thoughts about the iPhone line. First, if Apple comes out with a completely redesigned, slimmer “iPhone 17 Air” later this year that doesn’t have a 5x camera, I’ll have to begrudgingly pass on it and stick with the 17 Pro Max instead. Second, now more than ever, I truly, fundamentally want Apple to make a foldable phone that expands into a mini-tablet when opened. I don’t care how expensive Apple makes this device. I look at the latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I’m very jealous of its form factor, but I also know that I wouldn’t be able to use Android as the OS for my phone. If it weren’t for the lack of a foldable form factor in Apple’s iPhone lineup, I would give this category five stars. I hope we’ll see some changes on this front within the next couple of years. Michael Tsai: This is one of those years where the new iPhones seem fine, but I feel no urgency to upgrade from the previous model. The most interesting things to me are Photographic Styles and Camera Control. I’m hoping that the former will eventually let me reduce over-processing . The latter sounded promising but now seems more like the new Touch Bar: over-engineered and less useful than the basic Action button. iOS 18 adds a bunch of useful features. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues. James Thomson: Incremental updates, but still interesting. Stephen Hackett: By tightly bundling the iPhone, iOS, and the App Store, Apple has made it impossible to untangle the iPhone from Apple’s ongoing legal woes in the European Union and beyond. And by plastering the planet with rainbow-colored Apple Intelligence ads, Apple has wound the iPhone up very tightly with a group of features that weren’t even shipped when the iPhones launched last fall. That puts Apple’s most valued product in a slightly weird spot, but the Report Card demands answers, so let’s start with hardware. The iPhone 16 cycle brought Camera Control, an excellent bit of hardware engineering swamped with confusing software decisions. Learning to swipe, press, and click around the tiny UI can be confusing. With visual intelligence a press-and-hold away, it’s easy to be in the wrong mode entirely if you activate the button as you pull your iPhone out of your pocket. Apple has made it possible to simplify the Camera Control, boiling it down to a basic shutter button, but this requires delving into multiple sections across Settings. The Action button was added to the regular iPhone 16 models in 2024, and the 5x telephoto lens from the 15 Pro Max lives on in both the 16 Pro Max and the 16 Pro. Both are great changes, as is the move to a bolder color palette for the 16. However, 2024 was also the Year of Apple Intelligence. These loosely associated features run across various iPads and all Apple silicon Macs. However, Apple is marketing these features as a core component of its newest iPhones. That’s unfortunate, given how mediocre much of Apple Intelligence has proven to be so far. Apple’s writing tools are good, but nothing exceptional, and the UI is quite cramped on the iPhone. When it comes to image generation, Apple Intelligence shines with Genmoji, which is a genuinely fun feature, but it also falls on its face with Image Playgrounds. The images it creates are far behind the competition, and honestly, a race I wish Apple weren’t running. The company says it has gone to great lengths to build guard rails to keep Image Playgrounds from creating anything offensive or troubling, but it’s not hard to get it to create fictional images depicting some of history’s worst people. At least they look like cartoon characters, which is the best product choice Apple made here. The lack of photorealism may keep Image Playgrounds out of the headlines for making fake news, but Apple’s summarization of notifications has done just the opposite. From screwing up sports scores to re-writing breaking news alerts to say the opposite of the reporting, notifications summaries don’t seem ready for prime time. Apple hasn’t yet shipped the next generation of Siri either, which raises questions about Apple feeling rushed to get these features into the market. If it’s true, it’s an unusual place for Apple to be in, and I hope the company will not make the same mistake again. Zac Hall: Desert titanium and a dedicated camera button are nice. Nick Heer: While the flagship Pro model always makes the most noise among the kind of people who read pundits’ report cards about a tech company, the iPhone 16 should not be overlooked. Neither should iOS 18, which, even without considering Apple Intelligence, has solid updates to core apps I use every day and is more customizable. However, iOS remains buggier than I would like. I find interacting with the Dynamic Island and always-on display needlessly difficult, and Apple Intelligence is not very good yet. Andrew Laurence: This iPhone SE user looks forward to the next iteration of the iPhone’s value entry. Rosemary Orchard: I love the new camera button, but I feel it needs more automation possibilities Shahid Kamal Ahmad: Apple’s AI functionality feels like a rushed misstep. Most of us just don’t need what it offers, and the contortions to ring-fence access to OpenAI’s back end feel like the kind of thing Apple did when it apologetically added iTunes to a Motorola handset. Meanwhile, the hardware continues to be elegant, assuming what seems to be the definitive peak form factor for such a device. Incredibly, the 16 Pro Max feels less of a tank than previous models while still offering best-in-class performance and camera quality. After my iPhone mini 13, I didn’t think I’d upgrade. Now that I have, I don’t regret my purchase for a minute. This phone has all the performance required to deliver a class-leading UI responsiveness, and apart from the AI farce, a rollout that surely must be embarrassing for the executive team, it’s a device that does everything I need from a smartphone without ever breaking a sweat. It looks, feels and behaves like a premium product, but one where the UI could likely do with an overhaul to manage all the underlying complexity and features a little better. This complexity manifests in the form of additional buttons. It’s unusual for Apple to move so far away from the austerity of the Ive era, but perhaps with the addition of the camera button, they’ve made the UI more confusing than it needs to be. I keep forgetting that the button is there, and I sometimes activate it by accident, but can never seem to remember to use it when the need arises. This is to be expected, given that I’ve become so accustomed to the UI that’s been working well for so long. Philip Michaels: Phones are becoming commodities, and whatever will freshen up the platform AI in general and Apple Intelligence ain’t it right now Christina Warren: This is weird because, on the one hand, this is easily the most underwhelming iPhone Pro update I can recall in years and years. But the base model iPhone and iPhone Plus got some real juice. Apple Intelligence is still vaporware and nearly useless except for the ChatGPT integration, in my opinion, but I’m glad it forced Apple to up the RAM in the non-pro phones. But even though I genuinely have noticed nothing new on my iPhone 16 Pro Max compared to the 15 Pro Max, I think the base iPhone/iPhone Plus upgrades are really strong. It is too bad so many of the “features” of the phones are tied to software that might not land until mid 2025. Alex Cox: ust when the regular iPhone gets good enough for what most power users would want in a phone, the iPhone Pro is really pulling away from the smartphone pack in terms of actual professional use. Final Cut Camera with multi-camera support came out of left field and landed pleasantly into independent filmmakers’ laps. That said, when one needs to use multiple iPhones on multiple Apple IDs and then allow them to connect to another device running Final Cut Pro, it feels like Apple is trying to take it out of our laps. There needs to be a better way to manage and administer multiple phones as cameras when you’re a three-person company not brimming with enterprise-managed devices. Allison Sheridan: I’m going 5 again primarily because of the iPhone 16. They brought so many of the top-of-the-line features to the non-Pro phone, allowing people to make very few compromises to get a fantastic phone. Bringing 5X to the 16 Pro gave it feature parity with the Max, so there are no compromises between the two. Glenn Fleishman: Nothing stands out for me on the hardware side. As noted for macOS, I don’t find that AI serves a need. Siri on the iPhone seems marginally better. I use it a lot and feel like it can do more within iOS, but I still get weird transcription errors that seem like they should be overcome, and it fails to be able to do a lot. It often says, “You need to unlock your phone,” when my iPhone is unlocked already…and then Siri completes the task anyway. Peter Cohen: The 16 may be “built for Apple Intelligence,” but so what? Rob Griffiths: So far, at least, Apple AI has been a massive disappointment. I’ve found so little benefit from it that I’ve disabled it. In my work, at least, there’s absolutely no benefit to having it enabled. John Siracusa: My new iPhone 16 Pro has followed in the footsteps of its recent predecessors by being a bit better than the iPhone it replaced without adding any major regressions. My one frustration is the Camera Control. The button itself is fine, but most third-party case makers accommodated it by cutting a huge hole in the side of their cases, which I find awkward and uncomfortable. Only Apple and a handful of third-party case makers have included a pass-through button for the Camera Control, and none of those cases are to my liking. I hope more case makers offer pass-through buttons in 2025. Myke Hurley: I think if I were grading without my personal feelings, I would knock this down a bit. But switching from the Pro Max to the Pro this year has been a really lovely change. The new increased size of this phone has made it the perfect sweet spot for me. I am a fan of the Camera Control button, but I think the execution leaves a little to be desired. I think the swiping is too complicated, and the force needed to take photos is too strong. I look forward to this changing over time. I think that there was a lot more conversation in the broader community this year about the regular phone over the pro phone. This would indicate that Apple kinda missed the mark on the overall product mix. Quinn Nelson: On the one hand, we have the best update to the standard iPhone in years. On the other, we’re stuck with one of the buggiest, most feature-deprived versions of iOS in recent memory. How would you rate how the iPad and iPadOS platform went in 2024? Consider new hardware, new chips, OS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Brian Mattucci: I love my M4 iPad Pro. The screen is beautiful, the thinner design makes it easier to hold, and it feels like a really refined device. As with iOS, the Home Screen and Control Center customization options are wonderful. While there are plenty of ambitious changes I would love to see on iPadOS, the product they’ve delivered is still one that I find essential. Matt Birchler: After the no-new-hardware year that was 2023, it was refreshing to get updates to almost all iPads in 2024. The new Pros are amazing devices that even got the privilege of introducing the M4 generation of chips; the Air got a boring but fine update, and the Mini got maybe the most subtle update of all. Sadly, software was on the back burner this year as the iPad got almost no new features outside of Apple Intelligence and a couple of minor things iOS also got. Craig Hockenberry: I still want to run macOS on an iPad. It’s so weird that I take a MacBook on trips when an iPad would be a better choice. Carolina Milanesi: iPad Pro was a solid upgrade, but some of the issues about software being able to elevate the device to a Mac level remain. Kirk McElhearn: This year, I upgraded from an M1 iPad Pro to the M4 model, which is a very nice if overpriced iPad. The M2 iPad Airs also look fine, and these two iPads offer Apple Intelligence features for those who care. The iPad mini upgrade seems a bit underwhelming, but Apple has never shown much love to that model. Federico Viticci: What can I say about the iPad that I haven’t already documented extensively? I love the iPad Pro’s hardware, and I find the M4 iPad Pro a miracle of hardware engineering with no equal in other similar products. In 2024, I chose to go all-in on the 11″ iPad Pro as my only computer; in fact, since the MacPad stopped working a few weeks ago (RIP), I don’t even have a Mac anymore, but I can do everything I need to do on an iPad – that is, after a series of compromises that, unfortunately, continue to be the other side of the coin of the iPad experience. Going into its 15th year (!), the iPad continues to be incredible hardware let down by a lackluster operating system that is neither as intuitive as iOS nor as advanced or flexible as macOS. The iPad is still stuck in the middle, which is exactly what I – and my fellow iPad users – have been saying for years now. I shouldn’t have to come up with expensive hardware-based workarounds to overcome the limitations of a platform that doesn’t want me to use my computer to its full extent. But, despite everything, I persist because no other tablet even comes close to the performance, thinness, and modularity of an iPad Pro. Dave Hamilton: I’m an iPad mini user (and fan!) and am stoked to see it continuing to get upgrades. That tells me enough people are buying these models to keep some of Apple’s attention. (Is this where we pour one out for the iPhone mini? Dang, I miss that thing!) Benjamin Mayo: The M4 iPad Pro is undeniably cool. The thinness and compactness of the design is remarkable, and it leaves a lasting impression. The screen is great, and the M4 chip is crazy fast, even in a 5.1mm thin fanless tablet form factor. That product is a momentous achievement. Unfortunately, iPadOS remains woefully underdeveloped. At the very least, I appreciated that the iPad software got the iOS 18 home screen customization features at the same time as the iPhone did, rather than it being a year behind as has happened in the past. Dan Moren: The iPad’s frustrations are eternal. Although the hardware is fantastic, the software feels increasingly left behind, limited, and, at times, downright clunky. Stage Manager hasn’t fixed the multitasking issue, and the lack of modern audio support continues to keep me from doing my full job there. It’s probably time they let us run macOS or, at the very least, virtualize it. Chance Miller: As usual, you can break the iPad category down into two parts: hardware and software. The new iPad Pro is the most visually impressive product Apple has released in years. I mean, who had Apple comparing the thinness of an iPad Pro to an iPod nano on their bingo card? Software-wise, the iPad continues to falter. iPadOS 18 added nothing new to the experience and Stage Manager feels like abandonware at this point. It’s a real bummer because I’d love to use the iPad Pro more often, especially with the new Magic Keyboard, which rights a lot of what was wrong with the last model. Nick Heer: I still find the iPad-and-accessories lineup confusing, but it is in much better shape this year than last. Apple introducing the M4 chip in an iPad first, and not a Mac, is one of those twists I still find hard to believe, but it happened! I promise! Michael Tsai: This seemed to be the year where a lot of people accepted that the software is what it is. If you love iPadOS, the hardware for running it is now better than ever. If not, no matter how much potential there may be, it’s time to stop waiting for Pro to happen in the way that you want and just use a Mac. David Sparks: My same answer as every year: Solid hardware with too conservative operating system and software. Rosemary Orchard: Nothing whelmed nor underwhelmed me. Marco Arment: Apple finally updated the iPad lineup, and it has all of the strengths and weaknesses it has always had: great hardware with amazing computational power that’s almost impossible to utilize because of software limitations. Shahid Kamal Ahmad: I have the latest iPad Pro Max. I’d have given it a higher mark had the OS been able to use the power of the device better, but as has been heard by many notable commentators, it’s just not there yet; the hardware power continues to massively outpace any progress in delivering that power to the user in a way that suits the iPad without compromising its accessibility. While this is going to be a tough nut for Apple to crack, if they want to sell more devices, they’re going to have to make the iPad more useful. Michael Gartenberg: The iPad is the iPad. At the lower ends, they’re still the best for content consumption, at the high end, the Pro OLED models do deliver the best way to watch Severance on a mobile device. It’s a hard sell for creators to spend the money on a tricked-out iPad with Magic Keyboard when a cheaper MacBook will do the job better for most people. Aleen Simms: The iPad’s hardware is unparalleled, but iPadOS still feels like a failed experiment. The iPads Pro are such stellar pieces of hardware, but the inflexibility of the operating system hamstrings them. I know that many people use iPads to great effect, but most people are unwilling or unable to put in the effort it takes to create workarounds—or they don’t even know that workarounds are possible. Lex Friedman: The iPad product line is confusing. I bought an Air to replace an old Pro. I should have bought a Pro ONLY because Face ID on the iPad is so much better. But iPad Pros are ridiculously expensive. The iPad is great! But the product lines are too much. James Thomson: I genuinely couldn’t remember if there had been new iPads this year. Great hardware that continues to remain underutilized by the software. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues on iPad, too. Joe Rosensteel: I don’t find this platform compelling, and it’s mostly the fault of iPadOS. Shelly Brisbin: The new iPad Pro is great, as is the iPad Air, which adopts tech from the previous Pro. I’m thoroughly happy with my 13-inch Air. I’m not the first to point out iPadOS’ continuing limitations. The better the hardware becomes, the more glaring the software problems become. And it seems there’s little appetite or corporate support for making big changes to the platform. Zac Hall: An even thinner design and optional nanotexture define this generation for me. Quinn Nelson: iPadOS continues to be a “love it or hate it” experience, but the M4 iPad Pro, with its stunning OLED display, feels like a sci-fi-level feat of engineering. Steven Aquino: I was gifted a 13″ M4 iPad Pro (with Magic Keyboard) for my birthday in September. The hardware, most especially the OLED display, is stunning. As to software, although iPadOS does exactly what I need it to do, there’s no question the pace of improvement needs to pick up. John Gruber: The iPad hardware story is excellent. iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. (Please, Apple: bring nano-texture to the iPhone. Take my money.) The iPad Air got a fine update to the M2 chip in May. And the iPad Mini got its first update since 2021, and thus continues to be a product in Apple’s lineup. But iPadOS still strikes me like the no-man’s-land platform: nowhere near as capable productivity-wise as a Mac; nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months. I find myself noticeably more productive for it. To me, it’s like trying to work with my hands while wearing mittens. Eric Slivka: The iPad Pro, with its incredibly thin form factor, OLED, cutting-edge M4 chip, and landscape front camera, received a great update. The iPad Air also received a solid upgrade, and the long-in-the-tooth iPad mini received its Apple Intelligence upgrade. However, I would still love to see Apple do more on the software side to take advantage of the iPad’s power and screen size. Andy Ihnatko: There has been little progress with the OS or hardware. But we finally got a new iPad Mini, and my heart is full! Rich Mogull: The M4 iPad Pro is a marvel. The new iPad Mini is… well… maybe next time. I’d rate it a solid 4.5, so I rounded up. Stephen Hackett: There’s little to say about the iPad this year that hasn’t been said. The M4 iPad Pro pushes the ole “Wow, this iPad hardware can do so much more than iPadOS will let it” adage to the stratosphere. It’s powerful and thin, with an amazing screen, but it’s still just an iPad. The new Magic Keyboard looks fantastic, but it’s still hooked up to iPad apps. I’ve settled into equilibrium with this in my usage. My iPad mini is a great tablet for what I use it for: YouTube, TV shows, podcasts, and reading. I may hop into Slack or scroll through my mentions on social media, but I’m just no longer interested in turning the iPad into a computer I can or want to use for work. Zooming out, the overall iPad family is still messy in places. Thankfully, the 9th-gen iPad has been sent out to pasture, meaning all iPads finally use the modern gesture system for control. All iPads basically look the same, but there are still numerous differences as you move up and down the product line. The fact that Apple’s iPad keyboard page has a huge dropdown for a user to pick which iPad they have so the website can show them compatible models is not great, but Apple has been making progress. The current line of Apple Pencils is pretty straightforward, and having two models of iPad Air makes a lot of sense. I hope that the company keeps working to restore sense to the iPad hardware line while, at the same time, making iPadOS more capable for those who want to use their iPads more than they can today. Christina Warren: I hope we get a good iPad update in 2025 because I need to buy one for my mom, and I’m annoyed the iPad Air doesn’t ship with 256GB standard, raising the price the $700. The 2024 updates to the iPad Pro were tempting but I kept my 2022 11” iPad Pro because I don’t want to buy a new keyboard or Apple Pencil. And my M2 is still so powerful, given the software is utterly anemic. The problem with the iPad, or at least the iPad Pro, continues to be iPad OS. It just isn’t as robust as I would like for something that costs more than a MacBook Air. And the MacBook Air now has 16GB of RAM standard. And that’s before you have the price for the pencil and keyboard. If you’re going to tout the importance of the form factor, don’t nerf what I can do with it. It’s especially annoying when you can run many iPad apps on the Mac and use your iPad as a second display with touch support on the same Mac. So I continue to be mad that I can’t run VS Code or something like it on my iPad. And that my web browser on my $1000+ tablet cannot even run real web apps super well. The iPad Air is probably the ideal iPad for the middle-of-the-road user, though I think a 256GB 10th gen iPad is probably just fine too. I forgot Apple even updated the iPad mini this year. I think Apple did, too. Adam Engst: At least Apple released new iPads after a year off, but they don’t change the game at all. I’ve basically stopped using the iPad at this point, and none of the new models give me any reason to rethink that. Performance isn’t the problem. Myke Hurley: I am no longer going to grade the iPad on the disappointment of iPadOS. I have accepted the iPad for what it is rather than what I want it to be. The new M4 iPad Pro is everything I wanted. I use the 11-inch as my main device at home, and I love everything about it. The OLED screen is fantastic, and it is so thin and light—it’s a joy to use. John Siracusa: The M4 is a great iPad chip, but the highlight of the year for me was the Tandem OLED display on the new iPad Pro. I use my iPad as a tiny TV most of the time, and OLED displays provide the best picture quality available today. It’s been an amazing upgrade for me, even if it seems like I’m “wasting” that M4 by using it to watch videos for hours on end. Oh yeah, and they updated the camera placement, improved the Apple Pencil, and made all the Pro iPads even thinner. It seems like the rest of the world is not as excited as I am about the new iPad Pro. That may have something to do with the (continuing) limited and confusing nature of iPadOS. But for me, the new M4 iPad Pro is the best iPad ever. Paul Kafasis: The hardware updates were good, but I hoped to see more from the new Mini. I’d been waiting to upgrade to a new Mini, but the minor update meant I bailed on that idea. Casey Liss: While I don’t regret buying a new iPad Pro in 2022… I kind of regret it. The 2024 iPad Pros are really stunning—a phenomenal OLED screen in a case that cannot possibly be that thin. They’re such a joy to hold, and I want one despite having absolutely zero need for one. The Mini was my iPad of choice for many years, but I’ve squeezed it out by the combination of my phone getting ever-larger and the incredible utility the Magic Keyboard brings to my iPad Pro. Jessica Dennis: I pretty much only buy the iPad Mini, and Apple put out a new one in 2024, so I bought it. I like that it’s purple. I was upgrading from a 5th-generation iPad Mini, and other than being snappier (and having TouchID on the power button instead of a button below the screen), I don’t feel like I gained a whole lot. I am not surprised that Regular People suffer from Apple Pencil Confusion — even I had to go back and check which one(s) would work with my new iPad when I was deciding that I didn’t really need one anyway. Alex Cox: The tale as old as time is that iPadOS can’t keep up with the hardware in the iPad. This year, the design of the hardware doesn’t match the internals. Yes, the new form factor and screen options are great, but even the new Magic Keyboard for iPad feels like a mediocre upgrade after four years. The promise of the iPad’s modularity still doesn’t pay off. Eric Linder: I have purchased almost every iPad model since its debut, and I will likely continue to do so. I absolutely love it, and use it every day. But it is such a shame that the hardware improvements are so far out of alignment with its software. One thing I love about Apple is that so often, they underpromise and over-deliver. But with iPad OS, the opposite is the case. They hyped up Stage Manager so much, and I recall the excitement that fellow Apple geeks like Federico Viticci shared with the community. It shipped broken, which is somewhat forgivable, but what is not forgivable is that two years later, it seems like Apple has completely forgotten about it. This does not bode well for the future of iPadOS. Whereas iOS continues to build and iterate on most of its features, it seems like iPadOS is just throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and sadly, not much is sticking. Allison Sheridan: It was a solid year for iPad. The M4 coming to the iPad Pro before the Macs was interesting, while moving the camera to the landscape side was probably a bigger improvement to the user experience. The iPad Air got a modest improvement going to M2 and remains a solid choice. Even the iPad mini finally got an update. Gui Rambo: The fact that after all these years the iPad is still using the exact same foundations as iOS, including its multitasking model, is just baffling. We have iPads with Apple’s most powerful CPU cores that can’t have Final Cut Pro export a video in the background due to these stupid limitations. How would you rate Apple’s performance in Wearables overall in 2024? Consider the Apple Watch, Vision Pro, AirPods, and anything else you deem appropriate. Charles Arthur: The Vision Pro has been a calamity. What it needed was content, and what it also needed was app support. Apple hasn’t done the first, and alienated developers so badly in other areas that it didn’t get the second – Netflix and YouTube being the obvious objectors. If you can’t charm the two biggest content platforms to be on your device, then you are already fighting with one, perhaps both, hands behind your back. The lack of immersive sports content is significant. The Vision Pro will never take off without it. Joe Rosensteel: The Apple Watch is pretty stagnant and has feature regressions thanks to the ongoing patent dispute. The Vision Pro really whiffed. I was filled with ennui when the guy conducting my Vision Pro demo noted how sharp and readable the text was and how it could be used for work… A sentiment I didn’t share at all, and really underscored that people at Apple didn’t really know how to make a $3500 science fiction gadget exciting. Casey Liss: The addition of medical-grade hearing aid functionality to the AirPods Pro is Apple at its best. The AirPods Pro remain possibly my favorite Apple product of all time. I use them on and off all day, every single day. However, the utterly preposterous AirPods Max “refresh” is borderline insulting for fans of that device. I am not a fan of it and yet here I am grumbling about it. (Apple Watch specific stuff follows)I would never have guessed, when working on my 2023 Report Card, that I’d be here working on my 2024 Report Card, still discussing the Masimo lawsuit. It is rather absurd that Apple, a company with effectively infinite resources, hasn’t fixed this problem. Throw money at it in terms of licensing, or just buy Masimo outright. Do something. The Ultra wasn’t bumped in any way this year, which was disappointing. Before the September event, I had assumed I was going to buy myself an Ultra 3 as my new watch. The lack of hardware updates — other than an admittedly hot black case — convinced me to go with a Series 10 instead. I like my Series 10, and I am pleased it’s thinner than my prior Series 8, but it’s otherwise more of the same. The one large difference for me is the addition of fast charging, which is a surprising quality of life improvement — especially if you sleep track. Sigh—what to make of the Vision Pro? I preordered one, and collected it on launch day. It is, without exception, the coolest piece of technology I own. It is unlike anything I had previously experienced, and as I’ve said many times, using a Vision Pro is strapping the future onto your face today. As I write this, today a fortnightly chat with your beloved editor (and three others) is scheduled. These hangouts — which are “just” FaceTime calls — are so uncanny. Those of us who can make any given call will sit, using our Spatial Personas, in the circle the Vision Pro software puts us in, and chitchat. Something about having that presence makes it feel like so much more than the handful of monthly FaceTime calls I have with friends — including one of the others on this fortnightly call. A FaceTime call with my friend James feels like a phone conversation with video. A Spatial FaceTime call with James, Jason, and others… that feels like hanging out. I could make a strong argument that if you and your friends can convince yourselves to spend the absurd amount of money for a Vision Pro, Spatial FaceTime calls are worth it alone. But the killer app for the Vision Pro — if you ever leave your house to do work — is definitely Mac Virtual Display. Just before the end of the year, Apple came out with a second version of MVD, and holy smokes, it’s incredible. My at-home setup is three 5K monitors because, well, I have problems. While my 13″ M3 Max MacBook Pro lets me take all the power of a desktop out of the house, it very much does not let me take all the screen real estate. Well, it didn’t, anyway. Now it does. In fact, the Ultrawide mode on MVD is too wide. A problem that I never thought I’d have. If we can only normalize wearing them, my portable computing life will improve vastly. I have used my Vision Pro at our local library, but I always do so in a study room, because I’m too embarrassed to do so in the throngs of everyone in the main areas. I’m writing this post at a local Wegmans, and I’m doing so without my AVP, because I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. The Vision Pro is incredible, and every time I strap that stupid thing to my face, I can’t believe how lucky I am to have one and how cool this device is. However, I only have the occasion to do so once a week at most. The Vision Pro is an engineering marvel — easy 5. The Vision Pro is frustrating to use by itself and you look like an idiot when you do so — 2. That makes this section a 4 to me — as an engineer, I can’t get past how impressive it is. The Vision Pro is simultaneously more than I ever expected and a near-total letdown. Doing work in it is nigh impossible outside of MVD. Typing is so painful that I avoid it at all costs. Using Siri is not a substitute for a workable keyboard in visionOS. There’s not enough immersive content, although the pace is quickening and the content is getting ever-better. Ultimately, though, it’s too cool for me to grade any lower. Shelly Brisbin: Wearables feels like a category poised to evolve in interesting ways, and I’m here for it. 2024 gave us a couple of glimpses: the technology behind the Vision Pro and the adaptation of a pair of earbuds (AirPods Pro) to the task of finding and mitigating some kinds of hearing loss. I’m with those who admire the Vision Pro but are skeptical of its future as a viable product. I wish Apple were more open to the idea of offering developer-focused technology previews that aren’t necessarily ready for primetime. Let the early adopter/pundit class buy them, too, but set expectations about what the Vision Pro is good at. I recently saw how a developer plans to incorporate the Vision Pro into a wheelchair-based navigation assistant. Now that’s innovation! Marco Arment: Apple Vision Pro was the most disappointing launch I’ve seen from Apple in recent memory, with huge mismatches between the delivered product and consumer priorities and almost no follow-through from Apple to get software or content on the platform. A year after launch, a new owner can still watch the entire catalog of immersive videos during their first evening of taking the Vision Pro home… and then watch some episodes of Severance and still go to bed early. Lex Friedman: Apple Watch remains good. There isn’t much in the way of new features that I’m excited about on the Watch, but it remains good. I wish it were better at tracking steps on a Treadmill Desk, though. Apple Vision Pro remains a product that I am not at all interested in. Rich Mogull: The Apple Watch Ultra is getting close to being a true sports watch, but once you hit that category, Garmin still wins out (despite the latest Fenix updates being lackluster). The rest of the line is solid, but there still feels like room for growth. Eric Slivka: A thinner design for the Series 10 was a welcome change, but otherwise, we didn’t get much in this regard. The black Ultra 2 looks great, but no hardware updates was a disappointment, and we missed out on a rumored SE update as well that sounded like it could have brought some fun colors. I continue to be astonished that Apple hasn’t settled the blood oxygen patent dispute in the U.S. one way or another. Nearly a year in, Vision Pro continues to be a half-baked prototype. AirPods 4 look like a really nice upgrade that has helped modernize and streamline the lineup, but I’m an AirPods Pro user looking forward to a 2025 update on those. AirPods Max simply adopting USB-C and some new colors with no other changes is so sad that it’s hilarious. Stephen Hackett: Apple continues to kill it when it comes to AirPods. The AirPods 4 (especially with ANC) offers incredible value, while the AirPods Pro 2 continue to become more valuable to users through some remarkable software updates. Using AirPods as a way to take a hearing test or have your hearing augmented means millions of people who didn’t even know they had hearing loss will enjoy more moments with their loved ones in conversation. With the Apple Watch, it’s more of the same good vibes. Detecting falls, car crashes, and possible cardiac issues has saved an untold number of people, and with sleep apnea detection in the newest batch of Apple Watches, users can be notified if their Watches detect a problem. This is some of Apple’s most important work. I took the lack of an Apple Watch Ultra 3 personally, but the Series 10’s thinner and more powerful design almost makes up for it, as long as my bought-it-on-launch-day-like-a-maniac Apple Watch Ultra 1 holds on. 2024 saw the launch of the Vision Pro, and it’s unlike any Apple product launch I can remember. The Vision Pro is an incredible feat of engineering. Just holding the thing feels nice, and the years of work that went into it shows when the screens light up. It is the only AR or VR headset I have worn that hasn’t made me feel sick after a few minutes. The Vision Pro is priced like a computer because Mac-level hardware powers its array of cameras and sensors, screens, audio system, and more. visionOS springs to life on this hardware — after a lengthy boot process — and wraps the user in a world of their own content and apps. The floating windows feel real and stay in place as if they are made of actual frosted glass. The pass-through video feed of the outside world is by no means perfect, but it’s fast to respond to a turn of your head. A simple turn of the Digital Crown has the world fade away, dissolving into any number of landscapes that can help you focus on the task at hand. Sadly, there are just a handful of tasks best suited for spatial computing. Text input can be tedious without a keyboard, the lack of any window management tools mean there’s a lot of fussing about needed if you want to look at more than one application at once. (Stage Manager seems like it was built for this thing.) The App Store is quiet on the Vision Pro. The high price of the device has surely limited its adoption from both the user and developer perspectives. The new nature of the platform means users need to experience the Vision Pro before understanding it. Apple Stores have done a good job at this, but most consumers don’t know what they’d do with a device like this beyond playing games, which isn’t Apple’s strength. There’s no killer app for visionOS yet, and even if there was, you end up back at the price tag. Nick Heer: On the plus side, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and Vision Pro. On the other hand, Apple Watch Ultra New Color, AirPods Max New Colors, and Vision Pro. Christina Warren: AirPod Pro 2 remains one of the best products Apple has ever released. The OTC hearing aid function is such a huge win for so many people. I don’t understand why the AirPods 4 with noise canceling exist, but that’s not my business. Just buy the AirPod Pro 2s on sale. I regret to inform the world that I bought the USB-C AirPods Max. No one else should do the same. An overpriced product that lost features over four years, got zero improvements, and is now priced even worse compared to the competition. As for Apple Watch, I upgraded this year (and to the Hermes edition at that — the Grand H band got me) after sitting out the Series 9 year and I noticed nothing different — though the screen is larger than my Series 8 and the new Hermes band is amazing. But the lack of the blood ox stuff doesn’t impact me, but it’s a regression I dislike. I hope Apple can return this feature in the future. I did not buy an Apple Vision Pro this year and I do not regret my decision. It was a rare example of restraint on my part. I think it is a terrific tech demo and incredibly well-engineered. This sort of technology at theme park rides or in certain scenarios is jaw-dropping. But I could never convince myself I’d use it enough to not feel bad when it inevitably sat unused on my shelf. I can afford to buy one. But I am sadly not rich enough to be able to buy one and not feel angry about its lack of use. The weight and face pressure are also concerns — I’m glad to see the Belkin strap seems to have improved the fit. The lack of apps, let alone a killer app, outside of watching movies alone, is an indictment of Apple’s developer relations problems as much as it is an indictment of the AVP itself. I can’t help but think Apple’s focus on AR/VR at the expense of things like AI was a mistake, and I’m not convinced we’ll ever see the promise of Apple Vision Pro. Again, incredible tech demo. But I can’t convince myself to buy one and I love to use girl math to make bad decisions. It is what it is. Myke Hurley: I feel like this was a miss year for the Apple Watch from a hardware perspective – thinner is great, but I want to see more design change! However, watchOS 11 is a really great advancement. I love the enhancements to widgets and the Smart Stack, as well as the inclusion of live activities. The new Photos face is amazing. I love the fact that I get these moments of joy every time I look down at my watch, as it picks a photo to show me from a vacation or a cute photo of my wife. I cannot wait to see photos of my baby on this. The Vision Pro is a real mixed bag. The launch was so exciting, the hardware is so futuristic, and visionOS is overall a good operating system with some good advancements through the year. But the lack of developer support, and the loss of buzz for the product over the year cannot be ignored. I really hope for more, as I believe in the platform. But I could not give it the mark I had hoped for. Benjamin Mayo: Before this year, I had always assumed noise cancellation would be the AirPod Pro’s differentiating feature. I have a dislike for the feel of the in-ear tips, so I had just accepted I would always be missing out on that. But 2024 brought the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and it’s amazing. The noise cancellation is incredibly effective given the open-earbud design. Even the non-ANC base model is way better value for money than what Apple previously sold at that price point. Peter Cohen: The Vision Pro will be a fantastic product when it’s ready to come out of beta in a couple of years. Federico Viticci: I love my new AirPods 4, and I find the combination of no in-ear tips and basic noise cancellation a fantastic balance of trade-offs and comfort. I didn’t rely on AirPods Pro’s advanced noise cancellation and other audio features that much, so switching to the “simpler” AirPods 4 when they were released was a no-brainer for me. As flawed as the Vision Pro can be (it is, after all, a fancy developer kit with an almost non-existent third-party app ecosystem), I also think it’s an impressive showcase of what Apple can do with hardware and miniaturization if money is not a concern and engineers are free to build whatever they want. I don’t use the Vision Pro on a regular basis, but whenever I do, I’m reminded that visionOS is an exciting long-term prospect for what I hope will eventually be shrunk down to glasses. That, in fact, is the reason why I’m not giving this category 5 stars. I really want to stop using my Meta Ray-Ban glasses, but Apple doesn’t have an alternative that I can purchase today – and worse, it sounds like their version may not be ready for quite some time still. It seems like Apple is, at this point, almost institutionally incapable of releasing a minimum viable product that doesn’t have to be a complete platform with an entire app ecosystem and a major marketing blitz. I just want Apple to make a pair of glasses that combine AirPods, Siri, and a basic camera. I don’t need Apple to make XR glasses that project a computer in front of my eyes today. And I wish the company would understand this – that they would see the interest in “simple” glasses that have speakers, a microphone, and a camera, and release that product this year. I hope they change their minds and can fast-track such a product rather than wait for visionOS to support that kind of form factor years from now. Brent Simmons: Got new AirPods in 2024 — they won’t stay in my ear. I tried Vision Pro and am not surprised it didn’t sell well, especially at that price. Kirk McElhearn: The Vision Pro developer kit looks like it is full of innovations, but just doesn’t seem like something I’d want to use. Who wants to wear a computer strapped to their face for a long time? And the price is out of reach for most users. As a proof of concept, it’s interesting, but the mere concept of that device, and the way Apple has promoted it, feels like an episode of Black Mirror. Michael Gartenberg: Watch seems to have stagnated with some odd choices. Watch 10 has a screen that can do things Watch Ultra can’t, even though Ultra remains the best choice for battery life (and replacing the Rolex Submariner as the watch for desk athletes). The new back titanium is pretty, along with the new titanium bands. AirPods also got a weird upgrade with the new models lacking the hearing aid features that live in the pro models. As someone who listened to his iPod too loud at the turn of the century, I found the hearing features to work pretty well, but they aren’t replacements for OTC hearing aids. The battery life is way too short, and it’s kind of socially awkward to talk to someone when you have earbuds in, needing to explain that you really are listening to them and not tuning them out. I do think there’s a great opportunity for Apple to build a true hearing-first, music-second device for users. It’s clear they have the technology, and this is an area where Apple can really shine with a product to fill a need and make all the other products in that category obsolete. The less said about Vision Pro, the better for Apple. It’s been a long time since Apple took a swing for the fences and struck out. AVP remains a device that should have been called a developer kit or “peek at the future” science experiment, not as an end-user product. It’s an odd case where Apple tried to leapfrog the market and be first but also flawed. AVP doesn’t compete with anything on the market. It’s a device all alone in that space at that price. Apparently it’s great for watching Ted Lasso on your ceiling, according to Tim, but not really useful for much else. Ironically, the sleeper wearable/AI came from Meta, with their collaboration with Ray-Ban. Meta chose a subset of features such as photos/music/messaging/AI that relies on your phone to do the heavy lifting, works reliably well and comes in a form factor that’s actually fashion friendly. It’s the type of device with feature set and partnership that Apple could have and should have done. All the features would tie wonderfully into Apple’s ecosystem. Meta didn’t even haggle over branding—the Ray-Bans just say Ray-Ban. It’s not too late for Apple to do something similar, but I doubt that they would do a product copy if for no other reason than out of pride. Quinn Nelson: The Vision Pro is expensive and uncomfortable. It’s too heavy, the straps are awful, the software feels primitive and limited, and it lacks the robust first- and third-party app support it desperately needs. Even Mac Virtual Display isn’t polished enough to replace a dedicated desktop monitor. In short, it feels unfinished. But despite all that, it has improved significantly since launch—and I still find myself looking for excuses to use it because every time I put it on, I can’t help but think, “holy crap, this is incredible.” Andy Ihnatko: The Vision Pro isn’t an embarrassment for Apple; it’s fine. It’s not the breakthrough, paradigm-destroying hit product for 2024 that Apple imagined when they started developing the Vision Pro in earnest in 2016. Unfortunately, the TVA pruned that timeline during the most boring episode of “Loki” ever. Here in Earth-616, the Vision Pro is just a high-end version of one of those VR headsets that nobody really needs. Jessica Dennis: The newer, thinner Apple Watch is legitimately pretty great (and I’m grateful that I could still use all my existing bands). I was kinda bummed that there was no stainless steel model this year; I had psyched myself up to finally upgrade from aluminum, but I didn’t particularly care for the titanium models, so went with the jet black aluminum after all. I do really love all the ultramarine accessories, though — my phone and phone case are also ultramarine. Brian Mattucci: I love the new Apple Watch, and have no complaints. I was all set to upgrade to USB-C AirPods Max, but they didn’t change anything else about them so I had to pass. As for Vision Pro, I held off on even trying it for many months, largely due to all of the negative things I heard about it. But then I did the store demo and ended up buying one. I’ve used it nearly every single day since, and I’m very happy with it. I don’t fault Apple for creating an expensive device for early adopters (like me), but I do fault them for not doing enough to allow for a thriving App Store. Rumors of PSVR2 controller support are welcome, but late. I know Vision Pro isn’t primarily for games and that’s not why anyone would buy one at this point, but it adds value to the device and helps people justify the purchase (especially of an eventual more reasonably priced version). While AVP is a weighty device, I don’t find it uncomfortable with the solo loop alone. Everyone’s skull is different, and there are many options out there, but I think it requires a lot of a person to understand how to wear AVP comfortably and people simply aren’t used to it. Other complaints I’ve found don’t really apply to me (FOV) or aren’t that big of a deal to me (glare). Ultimately I think AVP is their best first-gen device ever and I’m excited to see how the next several revisions improve on things. I hope it doesn’t take them years to add folder support though – my home screen is a mess. Rosemary Orchard: I need an Apple Watch Ultra that fits on my wrist. Allison Sheridan: The clear winner on wearables this year were the AirPods. Redesigning them to fit more ear shapes caught my eye originally. but noise cancellation in the non-Pros has made them a big draw. The OTC hearing aid features of the Pros is also compelling. Apple Watch was a very modest improvement. Dr. Drang: AirPods are such a good product that Apple is now adding features I have to turn off. Head gestures seemed like a good idea until I looked both ways before crossing the street when a question was pending. John Gruber: AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update, and AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements—most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods continue to exemplify Apple its best. Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn’t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: Flux and Reflections. Setting aside the fact that I personally don’t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11 offers, by my quick count, at least 33 different watch faces that offer a non-digital seconds hand or indicator. And only two of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate? That’s bullshit. And it wasn’t just a launch thing, because here we are in January and no additional watch faces have been updated to support it. This is not how a serious watchmaker treats its watches. I will admit to caring far more about always-on second hands than most people, but what a waste of a technical breakthrough. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch. Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that’s it. Kind of weird for a watch that starts at $800 to skip a year of silicon improvements. Is Vision Pro a hit? No, far from it. But I remain unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it’s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today’s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the impetus for John Sculley and Apple’s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company. Many pundits of the era confidently proclaimed that the entire concept of a GUI was a gimmick with no future. Am I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has a bright and essential future ahead of it. The entire concept and paradigm is so new and different that, like the Macintosh 40 years prior, the product had to ship years before a version could be made at a price that appeals to the mass market, and years before there’s all that much to do using it. But, as it stands, Vision Pro today offers an incredible experience for watching traditional movies and shows, and a breakthrough experience for watching spatial content. If Bang & Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price. Spatial computing feels fun to me, but not very productive. That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro’s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) Mac Virtual Display feature is a highly-productive environment for work. I can’t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A’s in future years. John Siracusa: At best, the Vision Pro seems like a first step on a long journey. It will require many years of dedication, and perhaps some significant pivots, to turn this platform into a success. After spending a decade and several billion dollars on a car project that never shipped, I hope Apple can muster the resolve to keep plugging away at the Vision Pro. The new AirPods 4 are great for those of us who don’t want our headphones to be shoved into our ear canals. The noise canceling cannot compete with literal earplugs that are the AirPods Pro, but it’s still a nice improvement. The smaller size of both the earbuds and the case are also great. After a brief burst of excitement from the Apple Watch Ultra a few years ago, we appear to be in a holding pattern again as we wait for a more radical redesign of the mainstream Apple watch. The new watches this year were fine, though. Steven Aquino: Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro all are winners in general. The new Apple Watch’s bigger screen in a lightweight package is lovely, especially after wearing an Ultra for 2 years solely for its big screen. Vision Pro is the most accessible content consumption device I’ve ever used, but it is heavy, and the app story for streaming TV and movies feels thin other than TV+ and Disney+. Matt Birchler: The Apple Watch seems to be coasting along, which isn’t terrible, but it seems like that product is approaching its effective final form, while AirPods continue to get really good software updates that make them more valuable over time (except for AirPods Max, of course). The Vision Pro really drops this category down, as it does have some devotees, but they seem to be a huge minority of purchasers. There was chatter after the Vision Pro’s unveiling at WWDC 2023 that it sucked the energy out of the LLM “fad” that was just getting off the ground, but at the end of 2024 I think it’s clear that the Vision Pro is far more niche and unexciting than we thought it would be nearly one year into its time on the market. Aleen Simms: I’m glad they released the Vision Pro, but it still feels like a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist (for most people). I’m interested to see where Apple decides to take it over the next several iterations, assuming they continue product development. A convenient, glasses-like wearable could be a major accessibility boon for a lot of people. Michael Tsai: The AirPods 4 seem good. AirPods Max remains a product in Apple’s lineup. Apple no longer offers software updates for my watch, and I’m waiting for a new Apple Watch SE, which hasn’t been announced yet. Apple Vision Pro is technically impressive, but it increasingly seems like Apple built the wrong thing. Those engineering resources would have been much better spent improving Apple’s other platforms. Chance Miller: The AirPods Pro 2, despite being over two years old, are the standout wearable product of the year. The new hearing health features will go down as one of Apple’s most important releases of all time. Apple Vision Pro gets a lot more hate than it deserves. I’ve had very few if any, technological experiences as magical as interacting with it. Apple has work to do if it wants Apple Vision Pro (or whatever “Vision” product comes next) to truly become the future of computing. The good news is that I think Apple is taking the feedback in stride and will continue to perfect the spatial computing experience in years to come. The Apple Watch Series 11 is the first Apple Watch that feels like it sits flat on my wrist. It’s a subtle change, but one I notice every day. Andrew Laurence: Barely one year into the Vision Pro’s product life, I it feels like the early days of the Apple Watch — also introduced with a set of features that showed a puzzling lack of vision. Over time, the Watch found its market of utility, and apps sprung up around it. We’ll see if the same happens with Vision Pro. Meanwhile… is Vision Pro, like Apple Intelligence, a case of organizational FOMO leaking out to product? I, for one, have zero interest in “strap something to my face” computing. Might Apple Watch’s greatest impact be a generational change in product naming? Since the Watch, Apple’s wholly new products and services have followed its naming convention of “Apple Product”, with “Product” being a generic category word. Since then, Cisco retired “AnyConnect” for “Cisco Secure Client”; Dell retired years of brand equity for the same convention of “Dell Product.” Is “Ford Truck” next? AirPods Pro 2 continues to be my most consistently superlative purchase in some years. Carolina Milanesi: Apple Watch has become a cornerstone of the ecosystem for many users and a device that is keeping users in the ecosystem, as competition on the phone side is growing in Android both on form factor and AI. Paul Kafasis: AirPods updates have been great. Apple Watch, well, they really need to fix their patent situation. Vision Pro… God, so much hype, and it sure seems like a pretty big flop. From all I can see, even those people who were excited about it are finding themselves not using it. Alex Cox: Apple Vision Pro is the most influential hardware I’ve ever used, and I don’t have anyone to else to use it with, make things with it, or even demo it unless they’re willing to sit for forty minutes to make sure the guest mode calibration works. Apple is getting in the way of letting AVP grow, and not just because of the price. Until there’s developer access to more APIs and more accessibility to dev kits, I don’t think there will be anything interesting made for AVP that isn’t a big-budget immersive video partially funded by Apple. David Sparks: The Vision Pro deserves better than its current reputation as a pundit punching bag. While everyone’s busy dunking on Apple’s spatial computing experiment, I’m regularly strapping it on and using it for work and entertainment. It’s definitely first-generation, but there’s something genuinely compelling here. I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes. Adam Engst: The big story in 2024 for wearables is the AirPods Pro 2 and their hearing health and hearing aid capabilities. Those have the potential to be life-changing for many people. Otherwise, it’s hard to get excited about the changes to the Apple Watch Series 10. The Vision Pro is impressive technology that completely misses the mark in terms of being useful and affordable. Dan Moren: The AirPods Pro 2’s Hearing Aid feature is probably the biggest announcement in all of Apple’s wearables lines this year. It’s truly impressive, even if it’s not something that everybody’s going to use. But this is where Apple’s Health initiatives shine: solving actual problems people have and doing so in a way that’s accessible to the masses. I find the Vision Pro fascinating, but have spent so little time with one that I can’t offer more than that. I hope the next one’s cheaper. Dave Hamilton: The hearing features added to AirPods Pro 2 are a HUGE game-changer in my world. The active earplugs feature works so well that these have replaced my custom-fit musicians’ earplugs as my default earplugs for concerts. As for Vision Pro, I’m eager to see where Apple takes it, but it’s obviously just a public beta at this point of some very cool, extremely overpriced tech. James Thomson: The Vision Pro is a fantastically impressive technological achievement that no normal person should actually buy. The hearing aid functionality for the AirPods Pro could genuinely change lives. Craig Hockenberry: I have largely ignored the Vision Pro, and it appears I am not alone. I still don’t see a reason to put the thing on my head for hours each day. Michael E. Cohen: I have a Vision Pro and really like it, but mostly as the best widescreen and 3D video-watching experience I’ve ever experienced. The device needs more apps, especially the kind of apps only Apple can provide that demonstrate to other developers both the device’s unique (and sometimes less obvious) capabilities and the best ways to make those capabilities accessible to users. How would you rate Apple’s overall performance in Home technology in 2024? Consider HomeKit, the Home app, Matter, overall strategy and anything else you deem appropriate. Rosemary Orchard: I love the support of Matter. But feel more progress needs to be made. Lex Friedman: The Home app is ugly. Home app integrations in Control Center are useful but inflexible. Dave Hamilton: Attending CES the past two years, I saw a marked shift in how much Matter mattered to vendors. (I had to do it.) Last year, everyone was stoked to tell me they had added Matter support to their various widgets. This year, it was mentioned as an afterthought, “Oh, and yes, we’ll support Matter if and when that becomes important to our customers.” Myke Hurley: The new Control Center actions I can add have saved Apple’s Home efforts for me this year. Outside of that, I am not sure of anything else I could focus on. I hope for a 5/5 next year, though. Michael Gartenberg: The digital home is a mess, and Apple is doing its best to tame it in an Apple way. No one is doing a better job but no one is doing a great job either for consumers to implement. Steven Aquino: As an Apple user, I love the idea of HomeKit. The smart home makes tasks like turning lights on and off more accessible. What frustrates me, however, is its unreliability. I see “No Response” statuses way more often than I’d like, and it sullies the overall experience. Christina Warren: I don’t understand why Apple continues to pretend to invest in this area. Pro tip: use Home Assistant, the excellent open-source project that will let all your IoT stuff talk to one another using whatever you want — rather than trying to get HomeKit to do what it claims it is going to do. John Gruber: I can’t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something. Adam Engst: Did anything happen in 2024? Eric Slivka: 2025 sounds like it might be the year of the home for Apple, so 2024 didn’t see very much. The HomePod family managed only to replace the Space Gray mini with a Midnight one. HomeKit remains finicky at times, and I’m not sure Matter has helped much. David Sparks: This year, Apple made many nice quality-of-life improvements, including better Matter support, control center widgets, and (in my experience) more platform stability. There’s room for improvement, and I am interested in Apple possibly making its own accessories. But overall, I think Apple moved the needle in a positive direction. Casey Liss: The following is what I wrote for the 2024 report card. Word for word. Every word of it remains true, except now I’m using Home Assistant instead of Homebridge. I bumped my rating from 2 → 1 because, holy smokes, can we get some forward progress here, please? Same as it ever was. HomeKit is unreliable and doesn’t work with enough devices. It pains me that I have to run Homebridge. That’s not necessarily Apple’s fault, but it’s also not not Apple’s fault. Matter seems to be a total nothingburger. Same story: not their fault, but not not their fault. Though I’ve never owned a HomePod, I’ve heard continual grumbling of them failing. No thanks. Michael Tsai: My HomePod continues to not work well for Siri or music. This year, I dipped my toes into the Matter ecosystem. I was pleased to find that it all “just worked,” though the automation options are a bit limited, and I still don’t like the Home app. Paul Kafasis: Someday, the Home app and smart home controls will be better. They are still not this year, though! I have assorted Shortcuts to do things, and they seem to have gotten slower. Rich Mogull: As a 20-year home automation enthusiast with over 100 connected devices and a lot of automation code, I have historically rated this lower, but the combo of the Home app and Siri just gets the job done these days. I have no issues connecting what I need to and making it do what I want. A better Siri could easily bump this to a 5. Shelly Brisbin: Make the Home app better. It’s still awful. Matt Birchler: I scored this right down the middle because I don’t recall Apple doing much this year in the home category. However, I do have all of my smart home items in the Home app, and it works pretty well for me. In a post-Matter world, I have my choice of apps to use for this since my devices show up everywhere, but I still gravitate towards Apple’s app. Craig Hockenberry: If you had told me ten years ago that I’d have a phone app that controlled my 104-year-old home, I’d have laughed. Yet here we are: thanks to HomeKit, lights, heating, entertainment, and even a coffee pot are all seamlessly connected. Peter Cohen: Does Apple have a Home strategy? Does it really Matter? John Siracusa: Siri continues to be a boat anchor weighing down the HomePod and other HomeKit accessories. Apple Intelligence hasn’t even come to most home devices and probably won’t until they get hardware upgrades. Marco Arment: HomeKit continues to mostly work, but the promised world of Matter has still not materialized. The HomePod remains a buggy mess, and there are few signs of effort on either front. Benjamin Mayo: Apple kinda skipped this year as far as the smart home is concerned, so it’s hard to really pass judgment positively or negatively. I was disappointed by the lack of any Apple Intelligence strategy for the HomePod, though. Chance Miller: With the continued rollout of Matter, I expected a bigger upgrade to the Home app and HomeKit ecosystem in 2024. That didn’t happen. Apple has already lost so much of this market to other companies, but I’m hoping to see a renewed focus in 2025 with new hardware products and much-needed improvements to the Home app. Stephen Hackett: HomeKit continues to hum along, working better and better each year. The ecosystem continues to expand; if Matter ever really arrives, which ecosystem a particular product supports will become a moot question. Rumors are swirling about Apple entering new markets, with cameras, locks, and even smart screens a possibility for 2025 or later. We will have to judge those offerings if/when they arrive, but I’m fascinated to see what Apple would bring to the table. Federico Viticci: My entire apartment is wired to HomeKit, but I don’t love HomeKit because I’m tired of purchasing third-party hardware that doesn’t have the same degree of quality control that Apple typically brings to the table. I’m intrigued by the idea of Apple finally waking up and making a HomePod with a screen that could potentially serve as a flexible, interactive home hub. That’s a first step, and I hope it won’t disappoint. Seriously, though: I just would love for Apple to make routers again. Andrew Laurence: This technology enthusiast has yet to embrace Home or any of the “smart” home generations. All I hear about it is janky futzing and interoperability issues. These sound like problems, not solutions. Call me when it achieves the “Spouse acceptance factor” that TiVo had in 2000. Quinn Nelson: Another year, another bare-minimum effort from Apple to make any meaningful strides in the smart home space—beyond some obligatory Matter point updates. Apple Intelligence should play a key role in the home ecosystem, but the necessary software and hardware just aren’t there yet. Honestly, it feels like we’re still a few years away from Apple finally recommitting to the platform that needs it the most. Rob Griffiths: The Home app is a dreadful piece of software. Although I’m fairly technical, I still find it confusing, and the layout and home screen design are abysmal. Joe Rosensteel: I have experienced many bugs with Home. Even after I switched to the new home architecture, the tvOS 18.0 beta broke, and Apple TVs could not be used as a home hub for a few months. I replaced a bunch of WeMo smart plugs with Eve Energy smart plugs for no good reason other than WeMo just got flakey. There is no forward progress on the Home app, which remains a clunky pain in the butt. I still can’t add or remove seasonal devices (like smart plugs for my Christmas decorations) without it freaking out. I have Siri tell me it can’t turn on a scene from my Watch, but it can from my iPhone. It’s just a pervasive irritation that works often enough that I don’t rip it all out. Jeff Carlson: Still a mess, even though some of that is outside of Apple’s control. But come on, it’s been like this for years. Maybe 2025 will be the Year of Matter or whatever. I’ll save this comment for next year’s survey. James Thomson: How long have I been giving Apple the benefit of the doubt that this will be the year they turn around their Home strategy? Zac Hall: Home is a category that remains in the Six Colors Report Card lineup. Allison Sheridan: I continue to be disappointed in the Home app itself. The interface isn’t getting less baffling than it ever was, even for a seasoned user. Scenes vs. Automations continue to break my brain. “One of your devices didn’t respond” is a message that could use a slight improvement; WHICH ONE??? The only good news I see on this front is that at CES, Matter was all the rage, causing vendors to proudly display compatibility with HomeKit. Charles Arthur: Never improves. The commands haven’t changed: being able to put an IF statement in would make such a difference. (Yes, you can do it with Shortcuts if you have the patience, but who does? Why should you have to divert out of the Home app, which has Actions, to Shortcuts?) Dr. Drang: I like my new HomePods mini, but Siri still hampers their value. Carolina Milanesi: Does Apple even care anymore? Glenn Fleishman: I’m giving Home a low rating because, despite improvements to the Home app across platforms, including the important issue of granting guests access, it’s still a bloody mess of an interface. I’ve added several smart things to my network in recent months: a lock, outlet switches to control lights, a porch HomeKit bulb, more cameras, a doorbell cam, and a thermostat in a guest room—the management process is not wonderful. It’s inflexible, things break, and the connections among devices feel fragile. Apple hasn’t managed to convince many more manufacturers to buy into HomeKit, which means the set of supported options hasn’t grown much, particularly in the doorbell market. Automations remain limited and frustrating about what you can use as triggers and linking activities. For instance, I’d like to set my porchlight to go on for some time in the evening to early morning but also have it turn on when someone approaches the house other times, then turn off within minutes after that if it’s not within the period it should be continuously on. It cannot be done (to my knowledge, testing, and inquiry). I feel like some X10 systems of many years gone by had greater configuration options than I can achieve in some cases with Home. Even setting up a simple “away on vacation” setting requires lots of grouping and programming, and I am unable to see how I could set up random on/off times, which are usual to simulate people at home. (Some third-party apps for HomeKit-connected outlets and lamps offer these features.)The new sharing feature, too, doesn’t let me share lights—only locks, alarms, etc. So someone can’t housesit and be able to access the house’s lights and such without a full invitation. I’d like Apple to put in a lot of rethink about Home in general and come up with something dramatically better that fits the quantity and utility of what HomeKit is good for. How would you rate how the Apple TV hardware and tvOS software platform went in 2024? Consider anything you deem relevant to the platform. (Do not address the Apple TV+ streaming service.) Matt Birchler: After a few years of tvOS updates making the platform more annoying and more clearly an advertising platform for the shows Apple thinks I should watch more than what I am currently watching, it was nice for tvOS not to move further down this road in 2024. However, I recently used Google TV for a few weeks and was shocked to find numerous features that I greatly preferred on that platform. I really do hope Apple is looking at competitors and finding the good stuff they can adopt in their box. Rich Mogull: There is not a single other privacy-preserving device for the streaming age. Not one. And the Apple TV works well and looks and sounds better than nearly anything else. Joe Rosensteel: Apple really isn’t making any progress on tvOS. I use my Apple TV every day, and it is the only set-top box I would recommend to people, but that doesn’t mean Apple perfected the form. Things are more or less in the same state they were in at the end of 2023 when the Home app was updated with that sidebar that mostly can’t be customized. We still don’t have a unified Home and TV app experience. We don’t have anything for live entertainment short of sports notifications. We don’t have any kind of firm policy on pause screen ads (see the YouTube screensaver controversy from 2024). Apple hasn’t enticed anyone new to add support for the jog wheel they introduced on the remote in 2021. James Thomson: Hardware not updated since 2022, software feels like it barely changes each year, and yet still the best streaming device to buy. Allison Sheridan: Nothing went wrong but it’s been two years since they’ve changed the hardware. Steven Aquino: The Apple TV box is laughably over-engineered for what it mainly does: stream content. I appreciate the horsepower, to be sure, but the point stands. Software-wise, I’m still holding my breath for tvOS to have its iOS 7 moment. The grid of icons UI is good in some ways, but on a screen as large as a television’s, there is a lot of untapped potential. Widgets, etc. Chance Miller: The hardware feels as uninspired as ever, but the Apple TV is still the best streaming set-top box. Everything else is a poorly designed, ad-ridden mess. The Apple TV app could sure use some love, though. Quinn Nelson: Little was done, but little was needed. Benjamin Mayo: A minor year for the Apple TV box with no new hardware in sight. However, tvOS 18 did include a handful of niceties, like automatic subtitles and a much better Enhance Dialogue algorithm. Casey Liss: The Apple TV remains a product in Apple’s lineup. I am an Apple TV apologist and superfan. Other than a couple of Nintendo consoles, it’s the only thing that’s connected to my TV. We watch live TV using the wonderful Channels app. We watch movies and shows on Plex, the infuriating Apple TV app, and Disney+. My wife and I do our exercise using a couple of apps on the Apple TV. It’s is our TV, for all intents and purposes. However, our Apple TV HD is getting really long in the tooth, and though we only use it on rare occasions, it’s still getting pretty painful. It’s our third-tier Apple TV, and I’m anxiously awaiting the time when we can upgrade the main one, and thus trickle our 4K first-gen down and retire the HD. We haven’t really had any noteworthy changes to tvOS in… years? While on the one side, I’m not sure what I’m really seeking; on the other side, it feels like Apple has mostly forgotten that tvOS exists. John Siracusa: I continue to be frustrated with the poor quality of many of the streaming video apps I use on Apple TV, both in terms of bugs and interface design. Is that Apple’s fault? Maybe only to the extent that these apps are using standard Apple frameworks for things like video playback. But Apple also isn’t exactly leading by example when it comes to user-centric design. TV apps everywhere continue to prioritize the needs of the streaming service over my needs as a viewer. I want to continue watching my show. They want to shove a bunch of new content in my face while making the show I was just watching as difficult to find as possible. And they don’t seem to care if they lose my place or fail to track my progress. And heaven forbid I go back to refresh my memory by watching a scene from an earlier episode. Now my current place in the series is apparently impossible for modern technology to discern. Craig Hockenberry: The only thing I hate about Apple TV is how every damn service has its own weird user interface. Still, the Apple TV is the best general-purpose entertainment device for the post-cable world. Michael Gartenberg: It feels like Apple TV has not only gone back to being a hobby but a hobby that you started investing a lot of money in and got bored with. I’d give it a lower score, but the Snoopy screensaver is cute. Rosemary Orchard: Still using my Apple TV from last year?! Paul Kafasis: I’m a big fan of the Apple TV. I’m willing to pay a premium over other hardware to get an ad-free, upscale experience. That said, I’d like to see some new hardware here. Michael Tsai: Nothing much happened this year, though I like the new feature of automatically showing subtitles when you rewind a bit. I still don’t like the software or the remote. Lex Friedman: My cable company discontinued its support for Cable Cards, so I switched to its cable-over-streaming offer. However, this functionality works only on iOS, Fire Tablets, and Apple TV. So, I’m now reliant on Apple TV to watch cable TV, which I use almost exclusively to watch NFL games. It works just fine. Marco Arment: Apple TV continues to be a product in Apple’s lineup. Andrew Laurence: Nearly all our TV viewing goes through our Apple TV 4K. In the “streaming box” category, Apple competes at 5-10x the cost of its popular rivals. As a middle-aged technology nerd, I value its user experience and privacy stance. My college-aged kids are content with the built-in TV apps or a $25 stick from Roku or Amazon. Apple TV can play more roles than just a streaming box; is the whole, in fact, greater than the sum of its parts? Myke Hurley: Steady. Adam Engst: I appreciate that Apple has finally improved its photo screensavers, but why does the Portraits screensaver, which works like the iPhone Lock Screen/Apple Watch Photos face, ruin every photo by displaying the time over it? Eric Slivka: No new Apple TV hardware for the second year in a row, and only minor tvOS updates leave us wanting as we await the home revolution of 2025. I would still like to see a cheaper stick-style Apple TV option. John Gruber: I’m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024? Anything? It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we’re grading what happened in 2024. Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. Christina Warren: Apple obviously cares a lot about Apple TV+. It seems to care a lot less about tvOS and the Apple TV hardware. Another year, more lack of updates on hardware or significant updates on software and a price delta between other boxes that doesn’t improve. Especially since Apple has good TV+ apps on Roku, Fire TV and Google TV — not to mention stuff for TV makers like LG and Samsung. Jeff Carlson: Apple TV still doesn’t feel like it’s changed a whole lot, but I still swear by it because it’s not the crapware that every other vendor creates. Stephen Hackett: For the 2023 Report Card, I wrote, “The Apple TV hardware has been so overpriced and overpowered for so long that it feels like I’m wasting everyone’s time by mentioning it again.” I also said, “tvOS continues to feel trapped between Apple’s vision for the platform and what it can work out with streaming giants like Netflix.” Yup. Carolina Milanesi: Nothing to see here – no pun intended! Andy Ihnatko: Until Apple decides to give Apple TV a mission beyond “run streaming apps and generally be invisible,” it’s a solid 3 out of 5 by its nature. I’m giving it a 4 because of the new Snoopy screensavers. Glenn Fleishman: I still find tvOS’s UI primitive, but I use it for about 95% of my video watching across many apps, and it generally serves the purpose. Feels stale compared to other options and sometimes frustrating in terms of scrubs and basic rewind/fast forwarding. This may be a function of app implementation, such as how YouTube stinks and others don’t. How would you rate Apple’s performance in services in 2024? Consider the App Store (from a consumer perspective), Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple Pay, AppleCare, and anything else you deem appropriate. Brian Mattucci: I’m thrilled that Apple Music Classical finally got CarPlay support, but it’s still missing on Mac and AVP. Michael Tsai: iMessage and Siri still work poorly for me. Apple Pay and the rest of iCloud are OK. The other services don’t interest me except that their existence seems to be warping Apple’s product design decisions. Craig Hockenberry: I’m not a fan of how pitching services has become part of the modern Apple software experience. When I check my stock portfolio, I don’t need to be reminded of Apple News+. Carolina Milanesi: The Apple TV+ lineup remained strong, and the sports win is important for Apple, especially in light of Vision Pro. I have some concerns around Apple Card and savings as Apple looks for a new partner. Matt Deatherage: Barely noticed any improvements, didn’t notice any regressions. Chance Miller: The prices for all of Apple’s services remained the same in 2024 while the quality of each continued to improve. Apple Arcade continues to be underrated, and I’ve found myself opening Apple News on a surprisingly regular basis. In particular, the election coverage in the Apple News app was top-notch. Apple Music excels in a world where Spotify continues to combine music, podcasts, videos, and other junk into a single interface. Kirk McElhearn: Still only 5GB based storage for iCloud, which means a lot of people don’t back up their iPhones. This is unconscionable these days and borders on forced bundling, requiring users to pay for extra storage. Even if it’s only a dollar a month, the mere fact that users have to enter into a regular transaction with Apple seems monopolistic. There should be options to use other services to back up the device. I have the basic Apple One subscription, and it only comes with 50 GB of storage, so I have to pay another $3 a month to get enough. This all feels like Apple is nickel and diming people. Matt Birchler: Much like the home category, I am struggling to think of anything notable Apple did in services this year, and I guess I think they’re mostly fine. Steven Aquino: I wish Apple would revisit the Apple TV branding to make it clearer. There’s the box and the streaming service, but I’d bet most people associate “Apple TV” with TV+ instead of the box. The TV app adds more complexity and confusion in terms of naming. Brent Simmons: Most of the services I’ve tried work okay, but I’m annoyed by all the advertising for them. Paul Kafasis: I think Apple is spread too thin, and a whole lot of these items are distractions that aren’t worth their time. Lex Friedman: Apple TV+ and Apple Music remain very good. Apple Fitness and Apple News remain fine. Apple Pay is wonderful. iCloud storage is still an issue in 2025. C’mon, Apple. David Sparks: I understand how important services are to Apple and Wall Street. I simultaneously fear how much building services revenue now enters the equation for new products. Also, the free iCloud tear of 5GB was first announced in 2011. That was 14 years ago. As a point of reference, the human genome project took 13 years. Dan Moren: I use almost all of Apple’s services, and they are fine. But very few of them make me want to stand up and cheer. It’s eye-rolling that the company still hasn’t upgraded that 5GB base iCloud tier. Myke Hurley: The content! It continues to be great. There are always Apple TV+ shows in my favorites of the year, and this one was no different. Slow Horses, Bad Monkey. Great work. Benjamin Mayo: Apple didn’t make a big deal about the personalized ‘New’ tab in Apple Music, but it makes a big difference. The app feels a lot more vibrant and alive, with rolling recommendations and suggestions relevant to individual music tastes. It filled a big gap in the Apple Music offering. Philip Michaels: If Apple silicon was the smartest move Apple did in years, then setting up a bunch of services with recurring revenue that tapped into all those installed devices was the second smartest Jessica Dennis: I still love a fair amount of Apple TV+ content, and sometimes Apple News+ comes in handy. I’m an Apple One Premier subscriber, and luckily for Apple, I have not sat down to do the math and come to the conclusion that it’s probably not really worth it for me. Shelly Brisbin: Apple offers enough services now that it’s hard to craft an overall narrative. Some, like Apple Music and iCloud, are great. Apple News+, which I want to love because I believe in a news environment where multiple platforms and ways of staying informed can thrive, hasn’t taken hold or made a compelling case for its own unique value. Also, on the negative side of the ledger, a recent issue with a subscription purchased through TV+ left me stuck in a limbo of automated prompts, with no easy way to contact a human. This is an issue plenty of people face, but Apple tends to get more of a pass than other companies, it seems to me. There’s no Genius Bar for services issues. Rich Mogull: We are an Apple One family. The storage expansion solved my biggest gripe. News is my go-to news app, and across the family, we make heavy use of all of the services except Apple Arcade. The privacy features of iCloud, like Private Relay and Hide My Email, are underrated. Passwords and Keychain sync are borderline disruptive. Marco Arment: Apple TV+ is the flashy star of the services, reliably delivering great new shows and seasons. iCloud and the service infrastructure remain the quiet heroes, working reliably behind the scenes to make everything else work so we don’t notice. But a massive chunk of “services” revenue comes from inconvenient truths that Apple wishes we wouldn’t pay attention to. Look at these nice TV shows! Michael Gartenberg: Most services are somewhat stagnant, which is why we see all sorts of bundles that bring services into users’ hands they wouldn’t necessarily buy, like Apple News. I was particularly disappointed that there’s a song on Apple Music called “Let’s Go Bomb Tel-Aviv.” I expect more from Apple. Michael E. Cohen: The plethora of services offered can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate or even understand. That said, I have had little problem accessing and using many of them. Roman Loyola: I guess I should stop waiting for Apple to increase the free base storage amount. Stephen Hackett: All in all, Apple is doing a good job with its various Services. TV+ is home to some of the best storytelling, and Fitness+ is inspiring and fun. iCloud syncs data more reliably than ever. Apple Arcade has become home to many rebooted classic iOS games, while Apple Podcasts has made the industry more accessible than ever. There are still sore spots, but none of them are new. iCloud’s storage tiers are stingy and oddly spaced out, and the ads in News+ continue to spoil an otherwise solid experience. Charles Arthur: TV+ has been disappointing. Slow Horses is the standout series. Most else is indifferent and uninteresting. Glenn Fleishman: Everything worked for me this year! Christina Warren: My continued line about Apple Services is that they are not best in class in any area. But the ubiquity and the way they work with Apple products keeps me paying. But in my mind, there isn’t an Apple service that is best in class in any way, and what I ultimately pay for is the convenience. I will give the new Passwords app a shoutout because I think it can replace a 1Password or Bitwarden or LastPass subscription for many families. I still pay for 1Password, and I’ll continue to, but for most people in the Apple ecosystem, I think Passwords is good enough. So that’s a bright spot. Everything else. Meh. It’s fine. But I wouldn’t call any of them best in class. Andrew Laurence: In the name of all that is holy, Siri and Apple Music’s default for “play this song” to be the most recent release version in my library needs to be stopped. If I say, “Play the song Born to Run,” the original 1975 release is the only correct answer. John Siracusa: Apple really needs to give some attention to the client apps for its “lesser” services on its “lesser” platforms. The Music app on macOS is in desperate need of some love, and iCloud Drive in the Finder is still maddeningly inconsistent and buggy. Howard Oakley: Apple’s ‘curating’ of the App Store remains lamentably poor and isn’t improving. John Gruber: TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I’d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: “Wolfs” should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+’s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: Slow Horses had another crackerjack season, For All Mankind finished a good fourth season, and new shows like Dark Matter, Bad Monkey, and Presumed Innocent were all strong. TV+ is also a great streaming platform for small kids. iCloud, especially with iCloud Plus, remains secure, fast, and reliable. It enables so much seamless continuity (hence Apple’s “Continuity” umbrella brand for those features) across devices. But here we are again, with me repeating the same gripe from previous years: it’s miserly that Apple is still offering only a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier and has left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged forever. I wonder how many zillions of iPhone users out there don’t have device backups because they only have a free iCloud account with 5 GB? The Apple One bundle is a good deal, but the free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do. Brett Terpstra: I really enjoy Apple TV+ shows, but I have moved away from Apple for news and music. There are just better services out there. I appreciate Apple Pay and my Apple Card, but the only changes in that area this year that I know of were APY decreases on Savings accounts. James Thomson: AppleTV+ programming continued to be a highlight in an otherwise lackluster—or, at best, stagnant—set of service offerings. Allison Sheridan: Apple TV+ is knocking it out of the park on show content. Developers can now confidently include iCloud syncing in their apps, making a seamless and delightful experience for users. Fitness+ continues to add new workouts, and the interface improvements make it easier to get to your saved workouts. Casey Liss: We. Still. Get. 5GB. Of. Storage. For. Free. On. iCloud. Apple services are mostly good on the surface. Fitness+ is great, although (like the Vision Pro) I wish more content got added more frequently. Apple TV+ continues to fire on all cylinders — as I write this, I just finished Shrinking season 2, and I am counting the days to Severance season 2. Apple Music is pretty good, but annoying issues with the app on all platforms wear me down. Any time music just doesn’t play — without any sort of error messaging, naturally — I get just a bit more frustrated. Thankfully, Spotify has worked hard to enshittify their app recently, so I am not feeling the longing I once did for a return to the land of the green and black. I know services are printing money for Apple, but the value for money for consumers is bad and getting worse. We should have had more iCloud storage years ago — especially at lower tiers. Every time I see a NEARLY FORTY DOLLAR bill for AppleOne, I die a little inside. Which means I’m dying a little inside twelve times a year. Nick Heer: As Apple’s services business grows, it begins to do things that feel uncharacteristic but are increasingly commonplace. Partnering with Taboola is one example. Flaky client software is another. Also, remember how lots of people were locked out of their Apple IDs in April, and we still have no idea why? Dr. Drang: I’ve been very pleased with Fitness+, which surprised me. I do wish it would get smarter about the kinds of workouts I tend to use and stop showing me stuff I don’t care about. I guess I should bite the bullet and build up a library so I don’t have to hunt. Rosemary Orchard: Puzzles, etc., are still not available outside of America!!! Quinn Nelson: Apple TV+ continues to stand out as the shining beacon of excellence in an otherwise neglected lineup of services. Federico Viticci: I switched from Apple Music to Spotify last year, so the only Apple services we use in our household now are iCloud storage with family sharing and Apple TV+. I love Apple TV+, but they should make a native app for Android so that I can watch their TV shows on my Lenovo media tablet. As for iCloud, I use it for Shortcuts, app integrations, and basic iCloud Drive storage, but I don’t trust it for work-related assets because it’s so damn slow. For whatever reason, with Dropbox, I can upload heavy video files in seconds, thanks to my fiber connection, but with iCloud, I have to wait a full day for those assets to sync across devices. iCloud Drive needs more controls and tools for people who work with files and share them with other people. How would you rate the overall reliability of Apple’s hardware in 2024? Were things better, worse, or pretty much the same in terms of the hardware working the way you expected? Were there issues? Consider anything you deem appropriate. Benjamin Mayo: Stellar year as far as reliability goes. I can’t recall any scandal at all, which is perhaps a first. Matt Birchler: It’s amazing how reliable and consistent Apple hardware is. The iPhone, especially, is made at a scale where basically no other product in the world matches, and it still releases on time and at very high quality without fail. Paul Kafasis: Apple hardware has been great for me. Marco Arment: We live in a golden era of Apple hardware reliability that’s so good that it’s easily taken for granted. No other consumer tech company executes at this level of hardware reliability. Chance Miller: Another year without any major complaints in this category is a victory for everyone. Rob Griffiths: Despite the foibles with software, I’ve only had one hardware problem in recent memory (a new Studio had a bad motherboard). Michael Tsai: My most recent hardware has been working well this year. My 2019 Intel MacBook Pro’s internal SSD partially failed. The Mac is out of AppleCare, and the SSD is non-replaceable, so now it can only be used with an external SSD, which is inconvenient for a portable computer and somewhat unreliable (with sleep, etc.). This would be worse with an Apple Silicon–based MacBook Pro because, for security reasons, they no longer support booting from external storage when the internal storage isn’t working. Without being able to replace the SSD, the whole Mac would be dead. Kirk McElhearn: I haven’t had any hardware issues on any of my Apple devices this year. Dan Moren: Hardware reliability has been solid for the last few years. I can’t remember the last time I had a hardware problem that was not caused by actual damage. (Sorry, MacBook Air screen.) Jessica Dennis: All my Apple hardware has been pretty much rock solid. Howard Oakley: Hardware problems remain surprisingly uncommon, as far as I’m aware. Christina Warren: I got my mom a 16GB M3 MacBook Air for Christmas, replacing a 2018 Retina MacBook Air — a laptop that, in 2018, had 8GB of RAM and that I paid extra to get it with 256GB SSD. Her new model fortunately got the Apple Intelligence-led RAM upgrade, even if 256GB of base storage is abhorrent in 2024. Anyway, the reason I mention this is that I was reminded of just how bad Apple’s laptops were 6 years ago. Butterfly keyboards. Chips that required loud fans to cool if they were in thin chassis. Performance that frankly peaked in 2015. I spent $1400 on that 2018 MacBook Air and it was never a good performer (we didn’t have any reliability issues except for a minor hiccup last year that made me learn the ridiculous requirements for rescuing a Mac that won’t boot post macOS 11) and I’ve felt angry about that basically the whole time she owned it. When the MBA got a RAM upgrade and Best Buy had a loss-leader price for Black Friday, I jumped at the chance to upgrade her and I feel like this is going to be an excellent laptop. It’s really a testament to the work Apple has done since 2020 or 2021 to re-earn their trust, at least as far as laptops go. My iPads, iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches, and other devices have all had a good year as far as reliability goes. Federico Viticci: I have never had an Apple product fail on me, hardware-wise, in the 16 years I’ve been covering the company. If there’s one area where Apple is leagues ahead of its competition, I think it’s hardware manufacturing and overall experience. John Gruber: No news remains great news in this category. Stephen Hackett: Apple has long been a leader in hardware reliability. Now, with the company publishing repair guides and making parts available to end-users and small shops, users have more options than ever when something goes wrong. Carolina Milanesi: I have had some issues with the iPhone and AirPods, but nothing critical. Michael E. Cohen: None of my many Apple devices had reliability issues this year. Brian Mattucci: Touch ID is still mostly a miss for me on the Mac, even after upgrading to the USB-C keyboard. How would you rate the overall quality of Apple’s operating system software in 2024? Were things better, worse, or pretty much the same in terms of the operating systems working as expected? Where there issues? How would you rate the overall quality of Apple’s apps, including bundled apps and apps it sells separately, in 2024? Consider anything you deem appropriate. John Siracusa: Apple really needs to shift the balance between new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Today’s Apple vastly undervalues the process of “polishing” existing features. There needs to be way, way more of it, especially on macOS. Craig Hockenberry: I never tell my wife about upcoming changes in Apple software. I’ve found it’s a good way to get an unfiltered opinion about new things, both good and bad. Let’s just say there was a string of expletives regarding the changes to Photos on iOS. I’m seeing a trend towards complexity in Apple software. The recent changes in Mail categorization made no sense to me—and they were enabled by default! I had a similar reaction to Focus modes, but at least that wasn’t forced upon me. It feels like the designers and developers at Apple know their products too well. I’m sure a lot of these changes feel important to the folks working on them, but to someone who’s not following the products so closely, it’s just a series of confounding hurdles. Dave Hamilton: I wish Apple would focus more on reliability and less on changing features that have just been integrated into our workflows. I appreciate that they don’t want to stagnate, but wholesale changes to what might seem like minor features (I’m looking at you, Safari’s “Add to Dock” functionality) can be massively disruptive to one’s workflow. Brett Terpstra: I love Sequoia. It doesn’t have groundbreaking features, but it was a painless upgrade that broke very few apps, and the minor improvements have been really nice. It’s kind of the same story on iOS. It’s nothing to write home about, but it’s reliable and has appreciated touches. Dan Moren: Apple Intelligence: There’s a weird sort of reality distortion field operating here. Never has Apple spent more time on features that seem important strategically but actually feel mostly like things people don’t care about or won’t use. I’m not a generative AI naysayer, but Apple’s features here are uninspiring and lackluster. The biggest thing they rolled out on this front was Private Cloud Compute which is truly impressive technology with, so far, very little to merit its use. Chance Miller: Apple lowered the bar for software quality in its race to ship Apple Intelligence features. There are genuinely useful Apple Intelligence features, like in-line summaries in the Mail app, but botched features like notification summaries are a plague on the overall experience. The new icon tinting and Home Screen customization options in iOS 18 are great. It’s easy to dunk on some of the uglier creations on social media, but I’m glad Apple has removed the guardrails to let people do what they want with their phones. Joe Rosensteel: Apple has been slipping on software quality for a while, but with the focus on Apple Intelligence, the quality control has really suffered. We can’t even point to Apple Intelligence and say, “It was all worth it so we could have this” because all the Apple Intelligence software isn’t just buggy but poorly conceived from the outset. Casey Liss: Literally the same thing I wrote about software reliability in 2023: New shiny continues to trump reliability. It’s not awful, but it’s not great. Same as it ever was. New this year, Apple Intelligence and Image Playgrounds are mostly a dud. It was clearly a feature done while Apple was on its heels — a way to say, “We can do that too! Look!” I actually mostly like the notification summaries, but every time I try to have fun with Image Playground, it ends up being a frustrating failure. Myke Hurley: Apple Intelligence has been a thorn in the side this year. There are features that I do like, but the overall sentiment is not good for many valid reasons. I like Notification Summaries, but I know they are okay at best. For me, though, Image Playground was a mistake. They should have been able to see this, and it should not have shipped. It’s a bad version of something that isn’t great to begin with. Michael Tsai: The software quality slide continues. The same old bugs are still there. Finder views still don’t update or reveal properly, and external drives still don’t mount reliably. macOS Sequoia brought new problems, particularly related to storage. Now, it’s sometimes impossible to unmount drives cleanly. Time Machine deleted lots of my old backups unnecessarily and had trouble completing new backups. Third-party backup utilities are also having trouble, as Sequoia broke ASR’s ability to create bootable backups. Multiple of my Macs now have regular kernel panics, which never happened before. There are a variety of new networking issues. Safari often stops working under heavy load, so, though it’s still my default browser, I’m increasingly incorporating Chrome and Firefox. I wish that, instead of focusing on Apple Intelligence, Apple had focused on improving the quality of the OS and on improving the design of Music and the other media/services apps. Rob Griffiths: Both are just sort of “meh.” Nothing earth-shattering, long-standing bugs remain, and the Mac continues its horrendous slide toward the iOS UI. Howard Oakley: Although OS and apps have been generally good, there have been some moments, such as the serious bugs in macOS 15.0 that had to be corrected early and the failure to progress other apps. Perhaps most disappointing is Apple’s lack of insight into what’s important to users: for example, macOS virtualization on Apple silicon continues to omit any support for App Store apps. While I understand the internal conflicts behind that (over authorization), I find it hard to believe that Apple wasn’t aware of them before it even launched virtualization. Yet, after enabling iCloud access in Sequoia, it has still not done anything about enabling App Store apps, which greatly reduces the value of virtualization for many. Paul Kafasis: As I said, can Apple get off the annual OS update cycle yet? Given the new features in .x releases in the past couple of years, it’s clear that even they don’t believe in it at present. We don’t need new OSes every year, and Apple can’t actually provide them every 12 months. Slow it down—it’s really OK. David Sparks: I continue to be impressed by Apple’s Productivity suite with annual solid, updates. I’m reserving judgment on Apple Intelligence until we see more. Rich Mogull: I have a lot of devices, and they have all been quite stable. Andrew Laurence: The Apple Intelligence rollout has been a FOMO-fueled own goal. The incremental feature rollout belies the aggressive advertising, the hoisted petard of notification summaries, the doesn’t-pass-the-red-face “beta” excuse, and the unknown timeline of fulfilling the 2024 WWDC announcements. As I type this, the lying eyes of Apple Intelligence news summaries are reaching the mockery strata once held by Newton poetry. Brent Simmons: Hardware quality is far ahead of software quality. Rosemary Orchard: I wish Apple would not push beta features like Apple Intelligence on everyone. My parents had it without me setting it up and were asking me if they needed a ChatGPT subscription for better Siri! Christina Warren: Putting the Apple Intelligence of it all aside — I think this was a decent year for Apple’s main platforms. Are there some regressions and annoyances in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia? Absolutely. Nick Heer: Apple’s computers are lots of things, but, ultimately, they are tools. I would like them to feel more confidence-inspiring. Apple Intelligence flaws are surely going to show up several times here. Setting that aside, I find plenty of bugs in Apple’s operating system, even in core features like window management. There was a wild layout bug in iOS 18’s Now Playing widget that shipped in public versions for two subsequent versions. I feel like there was a time when that would be more embarrassing. Nearly everyone I know was, at some point this year, prompted to use Check In and share their location with their parents; none of us live with our parents. Bugs aside, the introduction of yet more nagging security alerts in MacOS Sequoia continues an unwanted trend. My problematic opinion of the year is that I really like the new Photos app on iOS 18. Also, the new Mail app on iOS. I continue to ask whomever at Apple is available to please fix the Music app on MacOS. Benjamin Mayo: This year’s Sports app is entirely new, and I think it takes a pretty novel approach to a sports scores interface. The Live Activities on iPhone and Watch highlight the best of Apple ecosystem integration. Adam Engst: Apple Intelligence is disappointing, particularly given how much Apple has promoted it. If anything, Siri seems to be getting worse instead of better. Kirk McElhearn: Please, Apple, take a year off from flooding us with new features and fix bugs across all the operating systems. I’m tired of spending time troubleshooting tiny problems. And AppleCare support for this sort of thing has gotten abysmal in recent years. While I didn’t have any such issues this year, over the past few years, I’ve had numerous cases with AppleCare which were escalated to senior advisors, who told me that they would “take ownership of my case” and from whom I never heard back, even after emailing several times. There seems to be little accountability with AppleCare anymore. Quinn Nelson: OS updates are typically accompanied by new features—not the promise of new features. Allison Sheridan: Purely from my perspective, macOS Sequoia seems quite a bit more fiddly than previous OSes. Apps crashing, annoying popups about apps wanting local network access, and, of course, the bug in ASR come to mind. That said, I continue to be delighted with the features of Continuity. Features like having all devices share a clipboard, using a phone to scan a document directly into Finder, or being used as a camera are things I haven’t yet begun to take for granted. Stephen Hackett: Even with the addition of visionOS, Apple was able to move the ball forward across most of its ecosystem in 2024. Apple continues to ship features simultaneously across the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. Bugs remain, of course, but it’s been a long time since I’ve spent an afternoon troubleshooting something. Starting with the relaunch of Notes in the iOS 9/OS X El Capitan days, Apple has worked consistently on growing its first-party productivity apps into tools that more and more people can rely on at work. Reminders has gone from some sort of digital Hipster PDA with its card-based UI to a full-blown task manager, complete with robust sharing, a Kanban view, and integration with Calendar. Freeform came out of nowhere to take on some serious contenders from third-party developers. Safari is the true favorite child, with features added every cycle. Photos has become robust and even more useful with the launch of family sharing a couple of years ago. My biggest complaint is the lack of consistency across Apple’s apps. Look no further than Apple’s tools for smart searching. Editing a smart list in Reminders is weirdly different than creating a new smart folder in Mail or Notes, and on iOS in particular, Apple teams seem to be working from different guidelines when it comes to design elements. The new Sports app and Journal use gradients and color in fun ways, while much of iOS is still starkly white and blue. Messages is a hodgepodge of ancient message effects and fun, new text effects that operate in different ways in different parts of the app. It’s time for some UI cleanup across the board, even if that makes the Mac user in me a little nervous that the disease that is System Settings would spread. Jessica Dennis: The Apple Intelligence stuff is just so underwhelming so far. I wanted Image Playground to be like Google’s Emoji Kitchen, and it’s really, really not. Image Playground does both more and less than what I want — I want a crying cactus, which is a mashup of the crying and cactus emojis, and instead, I get a standard boring AI-generated image that looks like all the rest of the AI “art” (let’s not even go there) these days. John Gruber: Unchanged comment and grade from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple’s software design is headed (or, in some ways, has been now for years), but their software reliability has been very good for me. Michael E. Cohen: Stuff mostly works. But nothing’s perfect. Matt Deatherage: Apple Intelligence to date not only doesn’t live up to its potential, it doesn’t live up to the commercials Apple has aired. Dr. Drang: Apple Intelligence has really hurt Apple’s reputation on both the oversell and underdeliver sides. They advertised features well before they were available, and then when the features arrived, they didn’t have all their parts—a complete inversion of the “old Apple.” Matt Birchler: I think Apple Intelligence is a mess right now, but the rest of Apple’s operating systems are in pretty good shape, in my view. More updates to iPadOS and tvOS would be great, and parts of Apple’s apps (mostly Shortcuts) can be buggy, but I still use Apple’s platforms and am confident they’re the best ones for me compared to the competition. Lex Friedman: Image Playground is stupid. How would you rate the overall relationship between Apple and its third-party developers this year? Consider anything you deem appropriate. Casey Liss: Lol. I would give this a -5 if I could. Apple’s monopolistic behavior continues unabated — despite the EU’s efforts to… uh… abate it. Apple completely thumbing its nose at the spirit of the new rules, knowing full well how wrong it is, is deplorable. Even though I don’t concur with many of the EU’s rulings, Apple basically saying, “screw you, I’ll do what I want,” is incredibly off-putting. On a happier, if more schadenfreude-y note, it’s been hilarious watching the Vision Pro App Store colossally fail. Developers have been treated like shit by Apple for the better part of a decade, and Apple is now reaping what it sows. Why would developers do Apple a solid and go on faith this [potentially DOA] platform is going to be worth our time and efforts when everywhere we turn, they’re giving us the middle finger? I did the bare minimum for Callsheet, and I almost regret doing that much. Developer documentation remains a perennial yet solvable problem. It has absolutely gotten better, but it’s still really bad. Andy Ihnatko: 2024 was just a typical year in which Apple expected developers to be grateful for the lavish bounty that the company has so generously provided them and not make trouble. If Apple treated all of its customers the same way they treated developers — who are also Apple customers — we’d all still be waiting for cut copy and paste on the iPhone. Chance Miller: I don’t think developers embraced Apple Vision Pro with open arms like Apple had anticipated they would. Whether that’s because it’s a niche product or strained developer relations, I’m not sure. Probably a little bit of both. If Apple wants Vision Pro to mature, this is something that needs to be addressed. Dan Moren: Apple’s pushback to the DMA is perhaps understandable from a business perspective, but it makes the company look petty and recalcitrant. There’s a decided sense that Apple doesn’t know which way the wind is blowing as regards people’s opinions of Big Tech companies. John Siracusa: Apple’s continued resistance to the avalanche of new regional regulations being forced upon it is not serving the company well. At a certain point, it behooves Apple to embrace the changes and enthusiastically forge a new, more open path across all markets rather than wasting time and energy fragmenting its products and making things as difficult as possible for everyone involved. Matt Birchler: Early 2024 was all about Apple fighting the U.S. and EU at every turn to not give up any of the restrictive rules they’ve set around monetizing every cent they can remotely justify. I think Apple’s developers and product people love third party devs, but the business people seem to only think those devs should be thankful Apple permits them at all to work on Apple platforms. Marco Arment: Developer relations remain needlessly strained. Antagonistic positions and greedy policies from Apple’s executives continue to burn developer goodwill, trust, and enthusiasm that the developer-relations team is trying their hardest to retain, but there’s only so much they can do. Christina Warren: I was going to give this a three but the more I think about it, I really do think this is an area Apple most desperately needs to have some internal “come to Jesus” discussions. The utter failure of the Vision Pro from a developer perspective, coupled with the drama around not just emulators but also the DMA and alt-app stores, shows that the tension between Apple and their platform devs is in as precarious of a place as I can recall seeing it. To be clear, devs are still building amazing apps for all Apple platforms, and I think Apple platforms have the best software in the world (games notwithstanding), but the ability for developers to make a living off that software gets more difficult all the time. And decisions around areas like In App Purchase and subscriptions for content that should never have a 30% fee associated with Apple (for things like Patreon) feel beyond capricious. I’m glad for apps like Delta and third-party app stores that finally allowed emulators in the proper App Store, but the continuous problems emulator devs have getting their apps and updates into the store continue to be frustrating. Jason said it best when he wrote, “the App Store era must end,” and I co-sign that entire essay. (I wish I had written it; amazing job, Jason.) I’m putting this under developer relations because I really do see this as a developer relations problem. Vision Pro, even more than Apple Watch, shows that developers aren’t just going to show up and build apps for Apple’s new platforms anymore. And I can’t blame them. Nick Heer: What made me score this lower is Apple’s attitude toward regulators generally. I empathize with the company’s reluctance to make changes demanded by what it surely sees as meddling bureaucrats. But it has been obstinate in ways I think are counterproductive for everyone. For example, despite requirements to change its anti-steering measures in one jurisdiction after another, it is holding onto those policies everywhere else. In the European Union, its compliance measures have turned Apple into its own worst enemy. Craig Hockenberry: Apple is blowing it with developers. Full stop. Look at the general ambivalence towards Vision Pro as a manifestation of this – a new platform needs developers who are excited and ready to explore a product’s capabilities. This did not happen with the headset. It’s a cumulative thing: a lot of folks went into iPad development with the same enthusiasm they had for the iPhone. Then, they realized that supporting the device was a lot of extra work without a lot of extra revenue. Then Apple Watch came along… same thing. You now have a situation where developers are leery of a new platform. Now, throw in some unsavory maneuvers to avoid regulations that let developers choose their path with customers. The new App Store structures are designed by lawyers and accountants, not folks who create software. It’s no surprise to me that all the developers I know have a growing distrust of Apple. Apple is doing a lot of taking these days and not giving back to the developer community that has helped make its products thrive. Carolina Milanesi: I feel the negativity of previous years has dissipated somewhat Alex Cox: I have nothing constructive—I just don’t like watching friends getting fucked over for making things people love. Benjamin Mayo: They might be doing it by kicking and screaming, but the regulatory pressure is improving the developer ecosystem. For example, retro game emulators like Delta are now available worldwide on the App Store! Michael Tsai: The same old issues with the App Store, documentation, and bug reporting. Nothing seems to be getting better. This was the second year in a row that Xcode shipped with a showstopper bug for Mac developers. Once again, it was reported during the beta period, but there was no urgency to fix it. The Swift toolchain is still crashy and unreliable. Apple continues to write SwiftUI and SwiftData checks that the frameworks can’t cash. James Thomson: Apple continued its numerous legal battles with countries around the world to extract its cut of developer sales. It was forced to allow third-party App Stores in the EU, but then used supposedly neutral tools like notarization as de facto App Review, the Core Technology Fee, and surrounding rules to deliberately make them as unappealing as possible to developers. Apple should compete on merit, not threats. Charles Arthur: Vision Pro. EU DMA and the wrangles over third-party app stores. Enough said. John Gruber: Fourth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple’s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple’s platforms. The opposite is happening. The big change globally this year is the Digital Markets Act going into effect in the EU. I stand apart from many in the Cupertino punditry racket in applauding Apple for its compliance efforts. I think it has complied with a terrible law as best it can while protecting its own vision for how its platforms should be designed and work. (And, of course, protecting its own vision for how it should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can’t and won’t argue that any of Apple’s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers. Despite the situation being largely unchanged, I’ve adjusted my grade on this subject from C to D this year because stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse. And I think we saw that with the relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro. There’s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- and third-party apps and games. With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform. That enthusiasm was tempered greatly last year for VisionOS, and I think it was a lot more about how developers feel about Apple and the App Store than how they feel about Vision Pro itself. Howard Oakley: I’ve had no problems, but the App Store and its review process never fail to shock and disappoint. Rosemary Orchard: They have removed the limited number of requests for each developer (company) per year; however, there are still a large number of APIs without adequate documentation. (One line!!) Paul Kafasis: Sadly, Apple has been absolutely torching developer goodwill for several years now. App Store policies have not improved. Its malicious compliance with EU laws has been terribly disappointing to see. It knows what’s right, and refuses to do it, because it wants to protect every possible revenue source it has. It doesn’t have to be this way. How much is enough? At what point can a company say “We’ve won, we’re going to do what’s right, not what’s most profitable for the next quarter”? Sadly, probably never. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues in most of the world, and where it doesn’t, Apple is still an enormous prick. This shocking level of greed — combined with its obsequious behavior toward the incoming administration — is burning right through the remaining developer goodwill. Myke Hurley: Easily one of the worst years I have seen from them in a long, long time. And it’s all down to the DMA. Apple’s response to legislation is ridiculous. Using notarization as a way to stop apps from existing, the Core Technology Fee, and countless more dark spots. They should never have gotten to this step, and now they’re here I wish they would give a little more than they are. Apple executives claim that the company wants to leave the world a better place, and the company champions numerous causes. How well does Apple live up to its own standards in 2024? Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple’s work force, and other political and policy stances. John Siracusa: While Tim Cook’s donation to Trump may benefit Apple, its employees, and even its customers, it certainly won’t have a positive social impact. Joe Rosensteel: I’m of two minds when it comes to Apple’s green initiatives. I think they’re great, but they do design systems where the whole thing has to be recycled instead of upgraded or easily repaired. I believe political and policy stances are really where Apple fell short in 2024. Notably with the European Commission and the trials involving the justice department. Like when we all found out how many billion dollars Google pays Apple to be the default search engine. At present, I can’t say I’m optimistic about the direction things are heading in terms of other political and policy decisions. Jessica Dennis: For a company that pays so much lip service to being green, using so much energy on very underwhelming AI stuff is very hmmmmm. And then, of course, there’s the million bucks Tim Cook sent to the incoming president — I guess he probably had to For Business Reasons, but it’s still gross, and I hate it. John Gruber: Apple’s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary. Their accessibility features are so far ahead of the rest of the industry that I don’t even know who’s in second place. On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple’s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now sharply right. If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade. But: politics. I understand (I think) Tim Cook’s thinking and approach. I wouldn’t want his job, and I genuinely wonder at times who would. Sing-song congratulatory tweets leave a bitter taste, but I’m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they’ve been dealt, not the cards they’d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don’t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can’t donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated a mere $43,200 thousand to Biden’s and expect us to do anything but laugh at the supposed justification that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That’s Tim Cook’s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it’s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it. I genuinely believe Cook is doing what’s best for Apple, and that’s quite literally his job. But it was true during the first Trump administration, and already is again in the second, that what’s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what’s best for the country and for the world. Brent Simmons: Seeking favor with fascists not only helps the fascists — it harms the world. Steven Aquino: From an accessibility standpoint, the AirPods Pro hearing aid feature has to exemplify Apple’s ethos of making the world a better place. It isn’t perfect, but the salient point is it’s tremendously significant the functionality exists at all. And it doesn’t take into account the continued work Apple did in 2024 to make its devices more accessible to the disability community. As I always say, Apple deserves more laudation in this realm than “gee whiz.” James Thomson: The push to ship Apple Intelligence has sacrificed a lot of Apple’s engineering focus and moral high ground in the name of boosting the stock price. Aside from many of the features not being in a functional state that should have been shipped to billions of people, Apple had a chance to lead the industry in terms of ethical training data and chose not to, damaging its relationship with the creative professionals who have traditionally been their biggest supporters. And in the end most people do not care about the actual functionality. But hey, the stock price went up. Marco Arment: Apple’s environmental work is very strong and commendable, but their continued strong presence in and reliance on China remains damaging and strategically limiting, and their explicit support and significant funding of the incoming Trump administration is opportunistic, dangerous, appalling, and spineless. Howard Oakley: Apple continues to champion several important issues, including the environment and privacy. However, there have been a succession of less glorious moments regarding the latter and a continuing lack of transparency. Lex Friedman: I continue to be disappointed by Tim Cook’s kowtowing to Trump. Alex Cox: Apple does exceed the on-the-ground bar that is “better than Meta,” but every year, they seem a little closer to the floor. Aside from all the political antics that the biggest companies in America all but “have” to do, I was most disappointed that there was no mention of how Apple Intelligence will impact their environmental goals. Most data on AI efficiency is all over the place, and I thought they’d have at least some information based on their on-device strategies. I’m no EACC bro, but as someone relatively excited about most LLM developments, it was disappointing that not even Apple felt they could address their energy use. Allison Sheridan: I was incredibly dismayed that Apple forced all AI developers from San Diego to move to Texas. Imagine being a woman of child-bearing age working in California and having to choose between your career and your health. I was disturbed enough by this to write to Tim Cook to explain what a horrific choice he had made. Zac Hall: Sometimes Apple reminds you that it is a corporation. Andy Ihnatko: Normally a solid 4, I’m docking a point this year. Apple’s Intelligence isn’t going to inflict the same degree of damage on the planet as Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft’s AI efforts. However, Apple utilizes those same AI foundries to build and train its models, so they aren’t entirely free of responsibility. I hope Apple’s 2025 Environmental Progress Report is transparent about the impact Apple creates as an AI customer. Rich Mogull: A 5 for general privacy, especially Advanced Data Protection and their partnering with Citizens Lab. 5 for environmental impact. A 1 for Tim Cook bowing to Trump. A 2 for their soft gloves with China. Shelly Brisbin: I’ll say here, as I always do, that accessibility, in particular, should be evaluated in terms of technology, utility, and effectiveness at making platforms and software available to all. It’s not about virtue signaling or even being nice for its own sake. So here goes: Apple had a good year when it comes to accessibility. That’s especially noteworthy in the Vision Pro’s varied and clever ways of providing access to a platform whose typical operation relies heavily on the use of eyes and hands. The company continues to tweak deep accessibility features, like this year’s Braille Screen Input updates. And AirPods Pro’s embrace of its identity as an over-the-counter hearing aid should give both users and accessibility advocates within Apple a lot of encouragement to do more. Paul Kafasis: I think Apple used to be better when it comes to global impact. I think they are now too relentlessly focused on squeezing money out of everyone and everything they can, to the detriment of everyone. They’re still better than most companies. They’re still pushing for environmental improvements, diversity, and more. But overall, they just seem much more money-grubbing to me. Brent Simmons’s post on this is worth a link. I think of it often. Dr. Drang: Did Tim Cook give more money to the Trump inauguration than to victims of the L.A. fires? Matt Birchler: I think it’s an overall win, although I don’t like how they treat software developers. It will be interesting to see how they play with the new U.S. administration. Christina Warren: I’ll be the jerk that says it: I miss the stickers, and I don’t think it was worth the so-called environmental impact. I am glad that FineWoven was killed (and sorry, but you’ll never convince me that the plastic they used for FineWoven was any more environmentally sound than just using the mid-quality leather they used before), but I’m equally annoyed the only way to get an official Apple Watch band in leather that isn’t an older model is by going to Hermes. Call me a selfish jerk (or worse), but I don’t think moves like removing stickers, moving to objectively worse materials for cases and watch bands, and forgoing previously included accessories (like wall chargers) — while still selling and trying to bundle said chargers independently — is the best and most effective way to reduce environmental impact. Or, at the very least, these moves feel like ways to cheap out and raise margins but under the guise of doing it for “environmental impact.” I’m glad Apple cares about sustainability; I wish it could care in a way that didn’t feel like they were using it as an excuse to cut corners and niceties. Carolina Milanesi: Apple continues to lead in sustainability, privacy, and the latest stand on not ending DEI programs. Philip Michaels: Given the current state of affairs in our new kleptocracy, I imagine this score will be very different in a year. Glenn Fleishman: I’m not in love with Apple’s current direction. The mandate to return people to the office seems counter to its environmental aims and discriminatory against employees of varying abilities, some of whom relocated. Apple’s adoption of AI, particularly partnering with OpenAI, seems shortsighted without specific plans in mind, given the impact on power usage. Michael Gartenberg: Apple’s impact on the world has gotten the attention of the DOJ and the EU, which is not exactly the impact they might have been aiming for, which is probably why Cook sent a $1 million gift to the new administration’s inauguration, including himself in the pantheon of tech CEOs all under scrutiny and all in attendance in Washington hoping the new administration will let them continue to have the impact on the world as they see fit. Matt Deatherage: if A.I. fits in with Apple’s pledge to be carbon-neutral in five years, they’re not making that well known when a lot of AGI opposition is about how much energy it takes. Casey Liss: Tim Cook donated $1M to Trump’s inauguration. Apple still relies deeply on China. Apple continues to think it operates above the law. Gross. It’s hard to be enthusiastic about Apple when this is how it behaves. Its move toward carbon neutrality is the only thing that kept this from a 1. Peter Cohen: Apple lives up to its standards. Tim’s personal ones left me puzzled. Myke Hurley: Carbon-neutral products are great. I am really happy they are able to do this with more and more. But storm clouds are swirling around: AI, legislation, and more. Apple is too big and too complicated to be a pure good force in the world. Michael E. Cohen: I’d rank this higher, but Cook is attending Trump’s inauguration, so…. Dan Moren: Apple continues to improve its environmental impact, but as with many of the other big tech companies, it’s feeling an inherent tension between reducing its footprint and increasing its reliance on AI, a technology that seems to be extremely energy voracious. I’d like to hear a little more about that when the company announces its next Apple Intelligence features. Nick Heer: This could be an essay. Scratch that — this could be several essays. This year, Apple made a big deal about its repairability and environmental bonafides, but it also continued to fight right-to-repair legislation, and we learned data center emissions are likely many times higher than claimed. Apple made contact sharing more private, but enabled by default a feature to remotely analyze users’ photos. I put my complaints about Apple’s European-centric measures in the Developer section, but they could easily go here, too. Stephen Hackett: The M4 Mac mini is the first carbon-neutral Mac ever made. It comes six years after Apple began using recycled aluminum in its Mac cases. The company continues investing in processes to make our world cleaner. On the social front, things are more complex. Apple continues to support important causes and will continue its DEI efforts, even as other tech companies are rolling them back. However, Tim Cook runs a company with a bigger economic footprint than many countries, and that means that Apple will play ball with the new Trump administration in ways some of its users will find disagreeable. It’s naive to think that a company the size of Apple would do anything else, even if I hope it rubs Tim Cook the wrong way enough to bother him. If you’d like to leave a comment about anything else, leave it below! Alex Cox: I think, finally, people are breaking away from feeling like they need to be a super fan of everything Apple does and every policy it has in order to appreciate the things they still do remarkably well. Eric Linder: This may be a bit meta, but there is something special about Apple that brings about a positive community that is critical at times, but only because of the love of Apple’s platforms and devices. I continue to applaud Apple’s environmental objectives and hope that as they continue to succeed, they really do continue to underpromise and overdeliver, not only with regard to the impact of its products and services but on their positive impact on the world. Andy Ihnatko: FREE CHARLIE BROWN! Howard Oakley: In 2024, the high point has been the release of the Mac mini M4, just months before the mini’s 20th birthday. At a time when Apple looked as if it was becoming obsessed with high-end experiments like Vision Pro, and AI, the redesigned mini is convincing many who have stuck with old Macs running High Sierra and Mojave to take the plunge and upgrade. The spirit of 2005 isn’t dead yet. Chance Miller: Apple’s 2024 leaves us with a lot of unknowns. Will Apple Intelligence live up to the expectations? Will Apple remain committed to Vision Pro? There are looming changes to the App Store in the EU, the DOJ case in the United States, and various other regulatory battles around the world. There’s a lot of uncertainty as we head into the new year, which is rare for a company as established as Apple. Rosemary Orchard: Developer relations are critical, especially with the integration of AI such as ChatGPT as a focus. Extending this to native iOS integrations (Siri intents please!) would be greatly appreciated. Allison Sheridan: It’s such a fun time to be an Apple fangirl. The speed and low power consumption of its laptop lineup are unsurpassed in the industry. Andrew Laurence: Apple’s Enterprise Workflow teams continue to do the Lord’s work. They bridge the gap between a remarkably difficult customer base and internal development priorities in which “the enterprise” is likely an afterthought, if it exists at all. We have become accustomed to new features having little to no available controls, and those that appear seemingly hastily bolted together. Apple is a customer-forward company but has yet to embrace the notion that the end user may not be the customer; that the customer may have primacy over the user, and the user is a risk being managed. Robert Carter: As I blind Apple user, I am pretty happy with the features that Apple added to accessibility this past year. I hope they will continue to use Apple Intelligence to enhance accessibility. Craig Hockenberry: WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET BETTER KEY BOARDS Zac Hall: 2024… not the year that Apple caught up in AI. Marco Arment: Apple Intelligence summary: Hardware is great; developers enjoy TV; missing vertebrae. Charles Arthur: The question I’ve really been asking myself towards the end of the year, and the one I want to ask Tim Cook, is: How would we know if Apple was becoming sclerotic? By which I mean that if the organisation has become unwieldy, unwilling to allow change, incapable of letting good ideas percolate rapidly upwards, how could we tell? We keep hearing and seeing how slow change is: it took an age for accessories to all get USB-C. The AirPods Max and the Pro Display XDR have gone years without being touched. Again and again it feels like it takes forever for even the simplest product upgrades to get out of the door. New ideas like the Vision Pro are hopelessly over-engineered, instead of being designed with a buyer in mind, which reminds me badly of the G4 Cube, which people loved as long as they didn’t own it; if they if did, they discovered the limited memory and some, the manufacturing stress cracks. But at least that Apple saw the problem and moved rapidly: the G4 Cube didn’t survive a year. Now it feels like a bad idea gets polished endlessly until it’s good enough to put out, and then is essentially abandoned. I worry about this. Of course, I might be wrong. But my question remains: how could we tell? What distinguishes a sclerotic Apple from one which is functioning fine, but incredibly deliberately? Kirk McElhearn: I think that 2024 was the year that I finally realized that the Apple of Steve Jobs is truly gone. The Tim Cook bot in interviews and presentations feels like an AI programmed by the marketing department; I get no impression that he really cares about products. At least the pre-recorded product announcements include many more Apple employees, but they all tend to have that same tone. I miss Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller talking about new products with perceivable love for the technology and what it could accomplish. I think Apple is so big right now that they can’t take chances. We grew up with a company that was constantly pushing the envelope, but now, at a time where there aren’t many new hardware features to add to these devices, we have discovered a company that pretends that things are “magical” too often. And you didn’t ask about Apple Intelligence. A half-baked bunch of mainly useless features in an attempt to catch up to a trend that Apple didn’t see coming. None of Apple’s AI features are original, and some, like Image Playground, are just childish. Apple is increasingly out of touch with what people really want to do, it seems, and I don’t see this changing until Tim Cook retires. Federico Viticci: I’m genuinely curious about what Apple is going to do with Apple Intelligence this year. Their first wave of previously announced AI features still hasn’t fully rolled out, and it’s fairly clear that the company is more or less two years behind its competitors in this space. While OpenAI is launching Tasks and Google is impressing the industry with their latest Gemini models and promising AI agents living in the browser, Apple is…letting you create cute emoji and terrible images that are so 2022, it hurts. That being said, I believe that Apple is aware of the fact that they need to catch up – and fast – and I kind of enjoy the fact that we’re witnessing Apple being an underdog again and having to pull out all the stops to show the world that they can still be relevant in a post-AI society. The company, unlike many AI competitors, has a unique advantage: they make the computers we use and the operating systems they run on. I’m convinced that, long term, Apple’s main competitors won’t be OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta, but Google and Microsoft. The Apple Intelligence features we saw at WWDC last year made for a cute demo; I think 2025 is going to show us a glimpse of what Apple’s true vision for the future of computing and AI is.

Title: DeepSeek’s AI Shockwave Hits NVIDIA Hard, Wiping Out Billions

AI microprocessor on motherboard computer circuit, Artificial intelligence integrated inside Central ... [+] Processors Unit or CPU chip, 3d rendering futuristic digital data technology concept background The artificial intelligence revolution is moving at lightning speed, and one of the biggest stories from last week underscores just how critical the technology has become—not just for Silicon Valley, but for America’s national security and global competitiveness. Enter DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that’s sent shockwaves through the market with the release of a new, highly cost-efficient AI model. While DeepSeek may not yet be a household name, its impact has been swift. Nvidia — the dominant player in AI chip design and, as of this morning, the world’s third-largest company by market cap — saw its stock price tumble after DeepSeek’s latest model demonstrated a level of efficiency that many on Wall Street fear could challenge America’s AI supremacy. To understand why DeepSeek is making headlines, let’s look at Nvidia’s market swings. Last Monday, the tech giant lost an astonishing $590 billion in market value. Tuesday saw a rebound of $260 billion, only to drop again by $130 billion on Wednesday. The company plunged 15.8% for the week, its worst weekly showing since September 2022. Why the volatility? DeepSeek’s AI model, built at a fraction of the cost of leading U.S. models, signals the potential for a new price war in AI. Unlike OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama models—trained on expensive high-end semiconductors—DeepSeek has developed an alternative that is allegedly 45 times more efficient than its competitors. Its final training run cost only $5.6 million, compared to the vastly higher sums required for U.S.-made models. Cost vs. performance of select AI models For many investors, this raises big questions: Will AI’s profit margins shrink as efficiency increases? Are Nvidia’s high-priced AI chips at risk of being undercut? Most importantly, what are the implications for aerospace and defense, where AI is becoming an essential tool in modern warfare and national security? DeepSeek’s breakthrough isn’t just a financial story — it’s a national security issue. President Donald Trump wasted no time responding, saying DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call” for Silicon Valley. Supporting AI development, including the data centers that power it, is no longer just about business—it’s a matter of strategic importance. That may be partly why, in his second week back in office, Trump announced the launch of Stargate, a $500 billion joint AI venture led by SoftBank and OpenAI. Backed by Oracle and MGX, Stargate intends to invest $100 billion immediately into AI infrastructure in the U.S. The goal? To cement America’s leadership in AI and keep its edge in technological warfare and cybersecurity. But, as some analysts and investors are pointing out, if the Chinese can match American AI’s performance at a fraction of the cost, is $500 billion too high? In any case, the Stargate development should catch the attention of investors looking at aerospace and defense. AI-driven military applications, from autonomous drones to advanced cyber defense, are not just science fiction anymore. They’re already reshaping global conflict. The ability to train AI models more efficiently could shift the balance of power in how wars are fought, how intelligence is gathered and how cybersecurity threats are handled. Meanwhile, American tech giants are doubling down on AI investments. Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook that 2025 will be a “defining year for AI,” with Meta planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in AI infrastructure alone. The company expects to double its GPU capacity to 1.3 million chips by the end of next year, significantly ramp up AI hiring and bring 1 gigawatt of computing power online. The AI boom is already creating massive economic ripples. According to Sensor Tower, revenues for AI chatbot and AI art generators have skyrocketed from $30 million in 2022 — the year ChatGPT was launched — to nearly $1.3 billion in 2024, representing an incredible 4,100% increase. Sensor Tower reports that the U.S. leads the world in AI monetization, accounting for 45% of global revenue, while China lags at just 2%. Global AI apps are now a billion-dollar industry While DeepSeek has proven technically impressive, it’s also raised serious red flags. For one, Microsoft and OpenAI are investigating whether DeepSeek acquired data from ChatGPT in an unauthorized manner. And two, cyber intelligence firm KELA has already exposed major security vulnerabilities in DeepSeek’s R1 model, showing that it can be easily manipulated to generate malicious content, including ransomware instructions, fake news fabrication and even details on explosives and toxins. For this reason, U.S. military service members have been warned not to use DeepSeek AI tools due to potential security risks. Despite legitimate concerns, I agree with UBS that DeepSeek’s emergence does not derail the overall AI growth story. As its editorial team notes, AI is not a zero-sum game. A more cost-efficient model could actually accelerate adoption across industries, further fueling productivity gains and market expansion. For investors, this means keeping an eye on how AI is reshaping aerospace and defense. The biggest beneficiaries may not be the AI application companies themselves, but rather the firms building the infrastructure: semiconductor manufacturers, data centers, cloud computing providers, cybersecurity firms and defense contractors integrating AI into next-generation applications. With the U.S. making AI a national priority, we’re seeing an unprecedented wave of investment into the sector. Whether it’s OpenAI’s partnership with Stargate, Meta’s multi-billion-dollar AI expansion or defense firms using AI for military innovation, the message is clear: AI isn’t just the future of tech — it’s the future of national security.

Title: How Corporate Approaches To DEI Are Evolving

Plus: Uncertainty Is Stressing Executives Out, Even If They’re Expecting Success; Tariff Talk Brings A Tempest To The Markets; Retail Apocalypse Predicted To Continue; Unions Score Wins While The NLRB Sees A Loss A new study from insurance company Sentry underscores a point that is likely to become a theme this year: Executives are optimistic about how their businesses will fare in 2025, but they’re also a lot more stressed. While almost half of the 1,000 executives and business leaders said they think their business will thrive this year, two-thirds are more anxious than they were at this time in 2024. The stress comes from many places. A total of 47% are under duress because of economic uncertainty, while almost as many—44%—say supply chain challenges keep them up at night. Other major stressors are financial—41% are concerned about the cost of employee health care and 36% point to inflation. More than a third are worried about labor shortages. The stress and uncertainty are keeping some executives from doing anything except working harder. Nearly all—97%—said they’ve deferred needed upgrades to their equipment, technology, cybersecurity or facilities. And almost half are asking employees to work longer hours. Findings of AlixPartners’ annual disruption index echo these concerns. Following the 2024 presidential election, the number of U.S. leaders who said they were more anxious doubled, from 23% at the beginning of 2024 to 46%. In that survey, 27% were concerned about shifting their manufacturing and supplier footprints, and 23% felt they needed to modify growth plans in response to U.S.-China relations. About 15% more said they needed to change their business model faster, and 12% fewer expect revenue growth this year. The whiplash of 2025 may end as the year goes on, or businesses will get used to the economic climate. However, the stress could burn some executives out quickly. The current average tenure of a C-suite leader is about four years, according to an analysis published last year in SHRM’s Executive Network, but in times of tumult and stress on business, it has historically been shorter. One aspect of business that has seen significant change is support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In the last year, many companies have moved away from their policies, and in his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump outlawed them in government. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about how this sentiment is reflected in boards of directors and C-suites. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs in the Oval Office. Considering the hours he devoted to talking about tariffs on the campaign trail and the massive changes made by executive orders so far, it’s almost surprising that Donald Trump waited two weeks to enact the trade taxes. The first targets were initially Canada and Mexico, which will see a 25% tariff on most imports starting on Tuesday, as well as China, which will get an additional 10% tariff. (Canadian oil tariffs will only be 10% to “minimize any disruptive effect” on U.S. gas prices.) Monday morning, Trump granted Mexico a one-month reprieve in exchange for 10,000 Mexican soldiers being deployed to the border to protect against drug trafficking. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs may cause “some pain,” but said it “will all be worth the price.” Most economists say tariffs tend to get passed through to the consumer, increasing prices for all Americans. Meanwhile, Canadian leaders have proposed a list of U.S. goods that will see their own 25% tariffs—including some food items, plastics, rubber, lumber and glassware. The tariffs were immediately felt on the stock market. Trump’s announcement affirming the tariffs Friday afternoon quickly erased a positive day on Wall Street, with all three major indexes tumbling. On Monday morning, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were all down more than 1%, with alcohol companies, vehicle manufacturers, tech companies and cryptocurrency seeing the biggest losses. The reaction to the tariff announcement reinforces the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s decision last week to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December, and GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation.” A Big Lots in Carle Place, New York that was closing last year. It is not expected to be a good year for retail. A study from Coresight Research predicts that 2025 is on track to see twice as many stores close as 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Up to 15,000 stores may close this year, while only about 5,800 could open. The study found that inflation, easy online shopping deals and suboptimal in-store customer experience are contributing to the closures. The year has already seen quite a bit of M&A in the retail space, Danziger writes. The biggest to date is JCPenney merging with the SPARC Group into Catalyst Brands. Higher-end brands have also been making deals—like Vera Wang’s acquisition by WHP Global, Stella McCartney buying back LVMH’s stake, Christian Lacroix’s sale to Sociedad Textil Lonia and Laura Ashley’s acquisition by Marquee Brands. Other brands that have been bought so far include Kapital, True Religion and Urban Skin RX. A Whole Foods Market in Commack, New York. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Egon Zehnder Global Head of DEI Cynthia Soledad. As scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion programs increased in 2024, the number of diverse individuals newly appointed to corporate boards decreased, though boards are more diverse than they were 12 years ago, leadership firm Egon Zehnder found in their 2024 global board diversity tracking report. President Donald Trump has also focused a number of executive orders on the topic in his second term. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about what this report means for diversity on boards, C-suite and corporate offices. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. There’s been a lot of demonizing DEI, but when you look at companies, a recent LinkedIn study showed nearly no companies cutting back on DEI. From where you sit, how does it break down? What are the actual feelings about DEI, both for boards and for corporations? Soledad: Starting with the corporate practices, I would say that the headlines are exaggerated. What is being called in a headline a “pullback” on DEI practices is usually not that. DEI work has evolved over time, particularly as regulatory and legal changes happen. For example, the affirmative action ruling a few years ago, and the subsequent legal test cases around corporate practices that look similar to affirmative action. Those regulatory shifts and changes in test cases do require companies to evaluate their practices and ask, ‘Is there anything that we would want to adapt and change because the regulatory environment’s changing?’ That's most of what I am hearing from the clients we work with: an evaluation given regulatory changes in the environment, not at all a rollback in terms of the importance of inclusive culture, diverse representation and continued investment. There is also a concern that, because of these headlines and sound bites, DEI is under attack and it affects morale. Companies are concerned that their employees will read these headlines and feel that these investments in inclusive culture are at some risk. I also am hearing from CHROs and DEI officers and CEOs that they are very focused on keeping employee engagement high, and helping those employees understand their levels of investment in DEI. How do you see President Trump's DEI policies in the federal government impacting the private sector? How about C-suites and boards? There is a ripple effect in the private sector partly because so many companies serve the federal government in some capacity, and these policies impact suppliers. In addition, these actions are obviously intended to sway public opinion. Even those companies who do not have government contracts will take note of the rhetoric, and their behavior could be influenced by the fear it is intended to create. The most direct possible impact is on corporate policies that influence supplier diversity, talent, and culture; impact to board diversity efforts could be softer. Nonetheless, these efforts are at some risk. Where do you see things going with the conversation around diversity, both as a policy in corporations, as well as with boards, in 2025? We can expect the landscape to continue to be fraught for the next year on this topic, with potentially more legal challenges to come. Because of this, companies will have to keep evolving their approaches. The commitment that companies, corporate leaders and board leaders have made to diversity and inclusion in companies is real. There is a core belief that companies are serving diverse customer bases, companies already have more diverse workforces than they have historically, and that they want to hold onto the best talent that they can. The core practices will remain steady. Companies are continuing to invest in building diverse pipelines of talent all the way up to the top, all the way up to board representation. Leaders say they want to protect that work, and to try to move through all of the distracting headlines as quickly as possible and stay focused on the core work.

February 03, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: A deep dive on DeepSeek and the future of AI
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/02/03/future-ai-deepseek-chatbot-thecubepod/
Time Published: 2025-02-03T16:10:55Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 11:10 EST / FEBRUARY 03 2025 by Ryan Stevens The tech world was shaken this past week with the release of the DeepSeek chatbot, sparking intense discussions about its far-reaching implications. In the latest episode of the CUBE Podcast, theCUBE Research industry analysts John Furrier (pictured, left) and Dave Vellante (right) break down what this development means for the industry, cutting through the hype to uncover the real impact. DeepSeek dominated the internet this week, sparking major discussions on AI, geopolitics and innovation, with its impact reaching from Silicon Valley to global markets. It put everyone on notice around AI efficiency, according to Furrier. “Is it a psych ops thing from China?” Furrier said. “Is open source going to change the game? There’s so many storylines. Is it a breakthrough?” All that dominated the Pod discussion this week. It’s possible that the release of the DeepSeek chatbot will bring with it some positives. It may teach everyone how to do things more efficiently in AI, according to Vellante. “That’s going to be a rising tide that lifts all ships, finally, because AI hasn’t lifted all ships as we know. It’s been narrow and focused in terms of those that have really gotten benefit from it,” Vellante said. “I think to the extent that we can lower the denominator … the value goes through the roof.” The real breakthrough here lies in DeepSeek’s use of a smarter, leaner model, according to Furrier. It was no fluke, having achieved the DeepSeek chatbot through smart model design and a mixture of experts. “They also did the distilling of other models, so they didn’t have to do the brute force crunching,” Furrier said. “They slashed memory, energy, and the time it needs to get the answers and reason with good performance without compromising performance. They get all that stuff … a lot of matrix multiplication involved.” The DeepSeek chatbot made a significant impact by combining innovative techniques in a way that wasn’t obvious, according to Furrier. It involved very clever engineering. “I don’t think it’s a breakthrough in a major way, but it was something that they did with the constraints that they had,” Furrier said. It’s possible that the developments lower costs and drive adoption, according to Furrier. It’s similar to what happened to the internet. “I was talking to some entrepreneurs this week. The classic AI trajectory, people are like, ‘Oh, it reminds me of the web,’ these critical moments,” Furrier said. “One entrepreneur said it reminds them of the iPhone revolution because the user experience shifted and that drove a lot of change.” People are saying that it’s a Sputnik moment, which may not be the best analogy, according to Vellante. But it does underscore that the development serves as a wake-up call. “Do you remember when in the ’80s, Japan’s ascendancy was freaking everybody out? I think this is significantly more competitive because the market is so much bigger and AI is so much more important today,” Vellante said. “But to me, the winners of the market, the market overall just keeps getting bigger and bigger the lower the cost is.” The DeepSeek chatbot news has driven several conversations over the past week. The conversation shifted from stock price impact to deeper discussions in Silicon Valley and the AI community about the true future of AI and its competitive landscape, according to Furrier. “What you’re starting to see is some of the things we’ve been saying on theCUBE here all the time, which is, it’s a systems revolution,” he said. “I call it the chip grid emerging, which is clustered systems, where it’s not about throwing gear at problems or GPUs. It’s the combination of the hardware configuration.” The event calendar for theCUBE is filling up, with theCUBE teaming up again with the New York Stock Exchange for a Super Studio event, welcoming Silicon Valley’s top CMO leaders innovating in artificial intelligence initiative on Feb. 14. This year marks the busiest tech event season for some time, according to Furrier. “Leading up to around 2018, I think, would be the height of the event season in terms of tech companies. I think we’re back at that level, Dave. I think we’re on the road every week in May,” Furrier said. April, May and June have tons of activity planned. There will be no shortage of things to discuss at the events on the calendar, according to Furrier. “There’s multiple threads, efficiency, software innovation, psych ops, global geopolitical Cold War race. I mean, this is all very interesting,” Furrier added. “Very, very interesting. We’ll keep track of it.” Antonio Neri, president and CEO of HPE Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission Donald Trump, 47th president of the United States of America Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO and chairman of Apple Inc.

Title: Former Barstool Sports CEO Erika Ayers Badan Debuts ‘Work’ Weekly Podcast: ‘I Love to Work, and I Love to Think About Work’

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Erika Ayers Badan will share lessons from her seven-plus-year tenure as CEO of Barstool Sports — which she’s affectionately called a “pirate ship” — and other insights gleaned from her career in a new podcast series. Titled simply “Work,” Ayers Badan’s podcast premieres Monday, Feb. 3, with new episodes releasing weekly on Mondays. It’s available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Amazon Music (via this link). Indie podcast network Lemonada Media is handling distribution and ad sales for the show. Fair warning: “I’m gonna use the word ‘work’ a thousand times in this thing, because I love to work, and I love to think about work, and be at work and help people at work, and talk about work,” Ayers Badan says in the show’s trailer (listen below). She will talk through topics like “what to do when your coworkers are idiots, what happens when you hate your boss and what do you do when you’re stuck in a rut.” Related Stories VIP+ Bob Dylan Streaming Boom Highlights Biopic Bump Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Will Move to Dismiss Justin Baldoni's Lawsuit “Work” also will cover a variety of topics including current events — like major corporations ending DEI programs, companies ordering workers back to the office five days per week, and “revenge quitting” — plus real-world work challenges she has struggled with in the past as well as those she currently faces. Ayers Badan’s guests on the podcast will include Lindsey Metselaar, host of dating podcast “We Met at Acme,” and Benjamin Kraim, founder of cannabis media and lifestyle brand WeedFeed. Popular on Variety In addition, Ayers Badan will discuss the backstories of sundry corporate jargon, like “circle back,” “bandwidth” and “EBITDA” (which, for the record, stands for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization”). “This is an unfiltered, vulnerable look at work and what it takes to make it at work,” Ayers Badan says. “Work isn’t perfect and neither are people but they both can be great. This show looks at what’s happening in and around the topic of work and offers perspective, advice and knowledge to those seeking to do more or be more at work.” It’s not her first podcast rodeo: At Barstool, she hosted “Token CEO,” a series that provided an “inside look on what’s going on at Barstool HQ.” Ayers Badan left Barstool, the bro-focused media company, in January 2024. That came after Barstool founder Dave Portnoy bought the site back from casino and gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1 (following Penn’s $550 million acquisition). Running Barstool under Penn’s ownership, Ayers Badan wrote in a memo to staff, “was a balancing act and kind of an exercise in futility — trying to generate bets at the same time as protecting a pirate ship while also subtly contorting it to be something more predictable, pacifiable and projectable to match with a casino company.” In April 2024, Ayers Badan was named CEO of Food52, a food-centered media and commerce company, after serving as a board member and adviser since 2019. “I have a brand-spanking-new job and what I wanted to do was to create a podcast for people who want to be better at work and want to make work a way to change and make their life great,” she says in the “Work” podcast trailer. She currently serves on the boards of the Premier Lacrosse League and public safety technology company Axon Enterprise (the maker of Taser weapons). Ayers Badan is the author of “Nobody Cares About Your Career: Why Failure Is Good, the Great Ones Play Hurt, and Other Hard Truths,” published in June 2024. Prior to Barstool, Ayers Badan held several senior roles at media and tech companies, including president of Bkstg, chief marketing officer of AOL, VP of Branding at Yahoo and senior director of MSN branded experiences at Microsoft. Lemonada Media is an independent podcast network founded in 2019 by Jessica Cordova Kramer and Stephanie Wittels Wachs. The company’s original shows include “Wiser Than Me With Julia Louis-Dreyfus”; “Fail Better With David Duchovny”; “Choice Words With Samantha Bee”; and “The Sarah Silverman Podcast.” It also recently announced Lemonada Books, a new imprint and co-development partnership with Gallery Books, a division of Simon & Schuster.

Title: NVO INVESTOR DEADLINE: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Announces that Novo Nordisk A/S Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit

February 03, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until March 25, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk as well as certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: 2025 NFL Mock Draft: Shedeur Sanders, welcome to Cleveland

Full Content:
The Cleveland Browns need a quarterback. They have the second pick in the 2025 NFL Draft — a draft with two clear cut quarterback prospects that have risen above the fray. Seems clear cut, right? But the Browns have several problems to address after following up Joe Flacco’s 2023 playoff run with a three-win campaign and the league’s worst offense. Cleveland has to surround that quarterback with playmakers and boost a once-proud defense. But thanks in large part to Deshaun Watson’s immovable contract — owner Jimmy Haslam handed him an unprecedented $230 million fully guaranteed after trading three first round picks for a player accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct dating to his time as a Houston Texan — the franchise enters the offseason an estimated $30 million over the 2025 salary cap. Keeping the second overall pick means not trading back and amassing the inexpensive assets that can guide the Browns from this place in salary cap hell. It also means putting a blue chip quarterback in a portfolio loaded with penny stocks. And that’s before getting to the fact one of the most outspoken personalities in football — a guy who could easily take aim at Cleveland’s myriad flaws and management issues — happens to be one of those quarterback’s very involved father. Despite all this, Shedeur Sanders? YOU are a Cleveland Brown. In this still entirely too early mock 2025 NFL Draft. Let’s see how the first round shakes out. Since it’s barely February, no trades in this lineup just yet. Let’s see which rookies make sense and where. Rich Barnes-Imagn Images Needs: QB, EDGE, OT, S, LB The Will Levis experiment was a valiant effort that ended in failure. Ward will run into many of the same problems Levis did — an understaffed receiving corps, weak blocking and an average-at-best run game foremost among them. But he also brings a higher ceiling to Nashville than the young veteran who’ll slide down the depth chart. Ward threw an FBS high 39 touchdown passes in fewer than 13 full games and added four more on the ground (and one through the air) in what would have likely been Miami’s best season in two decades had he finished up the Pop-Tarts Bowl. He didn’t, but that hardly matters; he’s a composed quarterback who’ll be an immediate upgrade in Nashville. Mike Watters-Imagn Images Needs: QB, OL, WR, RB, DT The Browns cannot separate themselves from Deshaun Watson’s contract, but they have to separate him from the starting lineup. A setback while rehabbing his torn Achilles took care of that, leaving Jameis Winston and Dorian Thompson-Robinson as the two available quarterbacks under contract for 2025. Winston is a viable but inconsistent backup and DTR was 2024’s worst starter by a significant margin. Thus, a team with several needs rolls with a boom or bust prospect in Sanders. The Colorado star’s penchant for big gains is tempered by his willingness to eat big losses in order to see those chunk plays through. That could lead to plenty of growing pains in an offense not set up to nurture him. Or he could power through and be a light in the darkness for a franchise dedicated to its own burial. Christopher Creveling-USA TODAY Sports Needs: QB, OL, CB, TE, RB, LB This isn’t the quarterback New York needs, but it’s a massive influx of talent that can spur growth on both sides of the ball. Hunter is some sort of mythical creature cursed to roam earth and he’s decided to make the most of it. He can punch up a young secondary alongside Dru Phillips (a rising star if 2024 is an indication) and Deonte Banks (a 2023 first round pick who regressed badly last fall). He can team with Malik Nabers to make life easier for whomever is throwing passes next fall. Head coach Brian Daboll is on the hot seat despite being 2022’s AP coach of the year. Finding the right way to deploy Hunter would give him job security and, importantly, give a tortured Giants fanbase something to cheer for after enduring six years of the Daniel Jones experience. Ben Queen-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, WR, EDGE, CB, OG The Patriots have many needs at expensive positions — just not quarterback. That leaves them in position to trade back should a passer fall and a desperate team try to move up. Or, in this case, they can just take the player most likely to tilt the outcome of the game on any given Sunday. That’s Carter, the latest Penn State pass rusher to wear No. 11 and make life hell for Big Ten quarterbacks. His 22 tackles for loss and 11 sacks each led the conference thanks to a relentless motor, absurd athleticism and a general desire to hit fellas so hard they forget parts of elementary school. Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, CB, S, DL, WR Johnson was a true shutdown corner at Michigan. He’s a big (6-foot-2), athletic defensive back who can hold his spot in press coverage or off the line and breaking toward the ball. He allowed a 52.9 passer rating in coverage this fall, which is only a disappointment compared to his 30.9 rating in 2023. Though a foot injury has forced him off the field since mid-October, he should be capable of bolstering his stock with a big Combine showing. That would be rain in the Jaguars’ desert. Jacksonville’s 0.14 expected points added (EPA) per opponent pass play was worst in the NFL. While this may not be the kind of offensive toy new head coach Liam Coen may want, it fills a major need and gets the Jags one step closer to a future where they don’t need to score 30-plus points every week to win (unless they’re playing the Titans). Detroit Free Press Needs: QB, EDGE, CB, RB, S Do I trust a Mark Davis franchise to make a meat-and-potatoes pick at No. 6? Not really! But Graham is the best player available and, as a Michigan man, someone for whom Tom Brady can easily advocate. If that message gets through, it’ll be an unexciting pick that makes Las Vegas undeniably better. Graham would pair with Maxx Crosby and Christian Wilkins to bring screeching chaos each time opponents drop back to pass. At 320 pounds, he’s big enough to be immobile against the run. He’s also quick and explosive enough to blast through gaps as a 3-technique lineman between the guard and tackle. Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: WR, EDGE, TE, S, QB, OT The Jets need a quarterback, but reaching for someone like Jalen Milroe here when there are a few similar options who’ll be around when New York makes its second round selection (or potentially trades up into the back half of Day 1) would be a poor use of draft value. Instead, they can make life easier for whomever is taking snaps next fall and take 2025’s top offensive line prospect. With Morgan Moses and Tyron Smith both pending free agents, New York needs a young pillar across from 2024 first rounder Olu Fashanu. Campbell is a big bodied, 6-foot-6 specimen who can keep pockets, and his quarterback’s jersey, clean. We’ll see how the pre-draft process affects his stock. Aryanna Frank-Imagn Images Needs: OL, EDGE, LB, WR, ETC McMillan’s stock may depend significantly on his pre-draft workouts. While prolific at Arizona — 2,721 receiving yards the last two seasons alone! — it’s fair to wonder if his crisp routes will have the same kind of cornerback-snapping potentcy at the next level. Even if he’s not a burner, there’s so much to like about his game. He’s got a Drake London-style catch radius, using exceptional ball skills and his long frame (6-foot-5) to protect the ball from opposing players. He can work outside or baffle defenders from the slot. But if he can’t consistently create separation, could he be doomed to a Quentin Johnston or (long sigh) N’Keal Harry-type career? Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, WR, S, EDGE, TE Ryan Ramczyk appears destined for a medical retirement, which stinks. Taliese Fuaga wasn’t quite the answer New Orleans hoped as a rookie. With the franchise mired in salary cap hell, New Orleans needs to find young, inexpensive players at premium positions. That’s Simmons, who used Ohio State’s playoff run to gain a minor edge over similarly rated prospects like Kelvin Banks, Aireontae Ersery, Josh Conerly Jr. and Wyatt Milum. Simmons has the chops to fix things as a Day 1 starter both as a freshman at San Diego State and a transfer with the Buckeyes the last two seasons. He’s long armed and powerful with the low center of gravity that should help him recover from rookie mistakes. Brian Losness-Imagn Images Needs: OL, RB, OL, S, EDGE Sure, the Bears already have D’Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson. But the Detroit Lions already had David Montgomery in 2023. Look what former offensive coordinator and current Chicago head coach Ben Johnson did after they drafted Jahmyr GIbbs 12th overall. Jeanty is a monster, Sonic and Knuckles rolled into one (seriously: his 27 handoffs per game were only one fewer than Montgomery and Gibbs combined for in 2024). He averaged 7.0 yards per carry and has scored 30 touchdowns (29 rushing!) in his first 13 games for Boise State. Now he gets to ease the pressure on Caleb Williams’s shoulder and thrive for a team whose 4.0 yards per carry ranked 27th in the NFL last season. Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, CB, EDGE, DT, CB Is Banks a tackle or guard? That’s the question that will follow him through the pre-draft process and may depend on his arm length. Here’s the thing, though. No matter how long his arms, we know he’s a certified butt-kicker when it comes to pass blocking. He’s quick, powerful and perpetually aware of where his quarterback is, using that position to leverage edge rushers right out of the play. Banks has a low center of gravity, allowing him to pry up blitzers and dispatch them behind the pocket. He’s similarly stout against straight-on bull rushes, using his strength to absorb punches and redirect defenders. Oct 12, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions offensive lineman Anthony Donkoh (68), tight end Tyler Warren (44) and defensive tackle Dvon J-Thomas (91) celebrate after defeating the USC Trojans at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, LB, S, OT, WR, RB Jerry Jones loves a flashy skill player. While Jeanty would have filled a need, Warren can do the same thanks to his ability to do just about anything across the offense. Warren has the ability to produce as both a receiver (79 yards per game) and runner (197 yards on 24 carries). In this case, he’d team with Jake Ferguson to give Dallas some juice in 12 personnel formations, flanking CeeDee Lamb with two tight ends and, at least in theory, making life a bit easier for Rico Dowdle next fall. This may not be the star for which the Cowboys hoped, he’d be a rising tide for an offense that desperately needs a lift. Matt Pendleton-Imagn Images Needs: QB, OG, CB, DT, S The bulk of Miami’s defensive line rotation will be free agents this spring. Calais Campbell is 38 years old. Someone needs to hold down the other end spot in the Dolphins 3-4 to help Zach Sieler continue to thrive (and Chop Robinson to reach his potential behind them). Scourton, at 6-foot-4 and 285 pounds, can be that guy (also considered: Arkansas’s Landon Jackson). He’s a big bodied defender who can hold his own against double teams in the run game or crash through gaps to flood the pocket on passing downs. He’s agile beyond his frame and as powerful as it suggests, making him a proper disruptor for a defense that badly needs it. Butch Dill-USA TODAY Sports Needs: IOL, CB, EDGE, S Ryan Kelly, Will Fries and Mark Glowinski are all free agents. 2024 fourth rounder Tanor Bortolini could ascend to a new role up front, but more help is needed — especially for a team that needs to establish the run to open up the easy mid-range passes that have been missing from Anthony Richardson’s game. That leads to Booker, who may not be as exciting as drafting Warren or Luther Burden but still fills a major need. He can play multiple positions up front and create pancakes from all of them. He can play hyperactive at times, but he’s a bulldozer who understands his assignments. USA Today Sports Needs: EDGE, OT, DT, LB, CB Trading for Matthew Judon didn’t fix Atlanta’s pass rush. The Falcons ranked 31st in both pressure rate (28.1 percent) and sacks (31) in what proved to be another lost season. Keeping Williams in-state gives Atlanta another powerfully built outside linebacker with a high ceiling in the pros. The former five-star recruit is far from a finished project, but he should be able to provide the kind of strength and bend on the edge to win with power or quickness. His ability to contribute on all three downs is a boon, but his biggest value to the Falcons will be a growing arsenal of pass-rushing moves. The Knoxville News-Sentinel Needs: EDGE, DT, CB, LB, S Arizona needs a pass rusher and Pearce may be the last top tier sack-master in the 2025 class. The Tennessee star is slightly undersized at 243 pounds, but his get-off speed is a true problem and gives him an easy pathway to chase down opposing quarterbacks. He may not be a three-down player immediately, but he fits a need for a defense whose 31.4 pressure rate ranked 27th in the NFL last fall. Baron Browning and Dennis Gardeck are both free agents and Zaven Collins has 10.5 sacks the last three seasons combined (thanks in part to Arizona’s inability to find him a lasting NFL position). Pearce is a lottery ticket, but the jackpot here is large. Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, RB, IOL, DB Williams or Pearce would have been a boon for a Cincinnati pass rush that boils down to: a) Trey Hendrickson and b) end of list. Luther Burden could address the loss should Tee Higgins leave in free agency, though the Bengals may look to a larger wideout to fill Higgins’s shoes. That leads us to Starks, who has top 10 talent and could fill multiple roles in a depleted Bengal secondary. He’d be able to thrive in the slot or as an over-the-top presence or slide closer to the line of scrimmage as a run-stopper with strong tackling skills. He can do a little bit of everything, which is exactly what Cincinnati needs. Brett Davis-Imagn Images Needs: TE, LB, S, IOL Part of me wants to add Bowling Green tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to this offense — especially if D.K. Metcalf winds up quietly on the trade market this spring. But Fannin will likely linger on draft boards. Walker will not and he fills a need for a defense-first head coach like Mike Macdonald. The Bulldog linebacker can do anything from the middle of the field, whether that’s chasing down tight ends, filling run lanes or blitzing the quarterback (6.5 sacks in 2024). He’s a fundamentally sound, high floor player who can make an immediate impact. He also has the awareness and athleticism to be an All-Pro. It’s not a glamourous or high-cost position, but it’s one Seattle needs to upgrade. Peter Casey-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, IOL, CB, LB… WR? Green is a risk. At 248 pounds he’s a bit undersized. Playing at Marshall gave him limited reps against elite competition. But he wrought havoc in Huntington, recording 17 sacks in 13 games last season — including two against Virginia Tech and another against Ohio State. Green and YaYa Diaby would be a very different kind of edge rushing duo, but each is a high motor pest capable of disrupting the passing game. His explosive first-step and closing speed makes him a menace, so even if he can’t win with a bull rush he’s capable of shedding blocks and cleaning up from wherever he’s lined up. Jay Biggerstaff-Imagn Images Needs: WR, EDGE, DL, OT In this simulation, the Bengals passed on Burden because they wanted a wideout with a little more size. The Broncos, on the other hand, already have a 6-foot-4 Courtland Sutton as Bo Nix’s huckleberry. Now they get the 5-foot-11 Burden to add new depth and explosiveness to the offense. Burden is a shape shifter who can thrive as a sideline threat or devastating chain-mover over the middle. He’s got great hands and vision to pair with explosive acceleration for big gains after the catch. He’s also powerfully built blocker who can help create space on off-tackle runs. Between him and Sutton’s big body and red zone skills, Nix suddenly has a dynamic do-it-all combination to unlock the next step of his NFL development. Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News Needs: QB, WR, RB, LB, CB, DL Three years after drafting Kenny Pickett in the second half of Day 1, the Steelers charge back into the breach. Pickett’s inability to process through his reads quickly ultimately put his NFL ceiling at “three good throws per game.” Milroe could fall into a similar bucket. There’s reason to believe he won’t. His mobility makes him a proper 2025 NFL quarterback. He’s run for 1,257 yards and 32 touchdowns the last two seasons, a number made all the more impressive when you consider NCAA stats count sacks as lost rushing yards. He can also deliver dynamic strikes downfield, which suggests he can slide into the offense designed for Justin Fields/Russell Wilson last fall and generate some success. Tim Heitman-Imagn Images Needs: WR, EDGE, OG, LB, S Jim Harbaugh needs an impact tight end and his former ward Colston Loveland remains on the board. But, TWIST!, here comes a star from Harbaugh’s old arch rival instead. Sawyer’s game-sealing strip sack in the national semifinal against Texas was the exact kind of high-effort, high-impact play the old school head coach cherishes. With Khalil Mack a free agent (and contemplating retirement), the Chargers get a player who had 15.5 sacks the last two seasons and who attacks running backs like he revels in contact. Reggie Hildred-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, DT, IOL, CB, OT Eric Stokes failed to live up to his first round draft status. Jaire Alexander played seven games in 2024 and looks like a pending salary cap casualty. While Carrington Valentine and Keisean Nixon can keep this unit afloat, it needs an infusion of new talent. Revel has All-Pro upside, but his draft stock is hampered by his place at a Group of 5 school and the torn ACL that ended his senior season after three games. The long-armed defender has elite top-line speed and can be an eraser on deep throws. He can thrive in zone or man coverage, using those arms to press effectively or accelerating to close distance (15 pass breakups and three interceptions in his last 15 games). Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports Needs: DT, CB, S, RB Morrison may be the last member of a thin second tier of cornerback prospects — not as good as Hunter or Johnson but maybe a notch above guys like Jahdae Barron or Trey Amos. Like Revel, he’s coming off a final college season cut short by injury after playing only six games for the Fighting Irish in 2024. But Morrison is an explosive corner who can snap off routes. His ability to close to the ball led to an FBS-high 10 passes defensed in 2023 and a directive to stay the hell away from him in 2024. He’s allowed a 58.4 passer rating in coverage this fall. If healthy, expect his stock to rise through the pre-draft process. Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports Needs: IOL, RB, DT, EDGE Membou has risen up draft boards as a tackle who handled his business in the SEC and can flex inside as a game-shaping guard. That’s exactly what Houston needs after a deficient line kept C.J. Stroud running for his life and stunting his growth after a dynamic rookie of the year campaign in 2023. The Missouri lineman is a lean 320 pounds, somehow, built atop a foundation of crazy athleticism. He’ll be a marvel as a pulling guard and a rampart in pass protection. While he’s still a bit raw, he’d bring All-Pro upside to a line that badly needs it. Matt Krohn-Imagn Images Needs: OT, CB, WR, LB, S Los Angeles managed to hold things together after injuries ravaged its offensive line. But Alaric Jackson is a pending free agent and Joe Noteboom has reached the void years of his contract. Factor in a 32-year-old Joe Havenstein and you’ve got a glaring need for high potential young players at an expensive position. Ersery has the chops to be a long term solution. He’s a massive (6-foot-6, 330 pounds) tackle who has improved throughout his college career. He’s got quick feet and sound technique along with experience playing both tackle positions. While his floor may be slightly lower than other blockers available, he could hang out as a swing tackle for a year before growing into his enormous ceiling as a pro. USA Today Sports Needs: OT, S, WR, EDGE Ronnie Stanley is a free agent. While he played 17 games this fall, he’d combined for just 31 the past four seasons. At nearly 31 years old, relying on him as a long term solution is an iffy proposition. Fortunately, Baltimore has the talent in place to make a bit of a luxury pick here. Conerly was the anchor for an offensive line that allowed just five total sacks in Oregon’s regular season. He’s a fast-twitch blocker who processes angles and reacts with the intelligence and foot speed to counter edge rushers inside and out. That gives him the chops to get out into running lanes and clear space for whomever is behind him — in this case, Lamar Jackson or Derrick Henry. Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: WR, LB, EDGE, DL, IOL Aidan Hutchinson will return from the broken leg that cost him the bulk of what was shaping up to be an All-Pro season in 2024. He needs help. Marcus Davenport was supposed to be Robin to his Batman, but was also hurt in 2024 and will be a free agent. Detroit could re-sign him, but additional bodies are needed. Jackson would be a massive addition, both physically and on the stat sheet. The 6-foot-7 specimen is long and angular but has a solid bend to keep his pad level low enough to keep his leverage. He’s quick and strong and can win inside and out. Now he’d get the chance to clean up the messes Hutchinson sends him — and create a few of his own. The Providence Journal Needs: DL, CB, EDGE, RB, S Washington may have bigger defensive holes to fill than at tackle, but Grant’s slide out of the top 20 presents tremendous value for a unit in dire need of upgrades. The Michigan standout is a 340-pound crime against physics to clog running lanes and shrink pockets from the inside-out. The Commanders need it. They ranked just 27th in run defense despite 2024’s breakthrough. Their 33 percent pressure rate was roughly the NFL average, but on par with their 32.9 percent blitz rate. Grant can help Washington get to the quarterback without sacrificing extra defenders in passing lanes. Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images Needs: CB, LB, WR, EDGE, S The Bills survived the loss of 2023’s starting safeties after moving on from Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Now Damar Hamlin heads to free agency and even if he stays creates room for an upgrade. Would Emmanwori be too similar to returning strong safety Taylor Rapp? Physically it would appear that way, but there are Kyle Hamilton traits to the 6-foot-3, 225-pound defensive back’s game. He’s got the top speed to be an over-the-top deterrent and the size and tackling to be a bull against the run. He’s also the kind of worker who’d immediately ingratiate himself to Bills Mafia, which is a bonus. Petre Thomas-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, S, CB OT, LB Nolan Smith is evolving into a speed rushing nightmare. But Josh Sweat is a free agent (so is Milton Williams) and the pass rush around him needs reinforcements. There’s nothing general manager Howie Roseman likes more than adding a blue chip SEC talent to his defensive front. Umanmielen’s transfer from Florida to Ole Miss resulted in career highs in both sacks (10.5) and tackles for loss (14). He’s a wide-bodied edge rusher with a blistering first step and the hustle to stick with every play. He’s got a handful of ways to win on the edge, though none may be more effective than his spin. Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News Needs: CB, LB, RB, WR Nick Bolton is headed to free agency. While solid wideout and tailback options remain on the board, Kansas City has the opportunity to punch up the middle of its defense with a player who might be 2025’s best off-ball linebacker. Campbell is a do-everything monster who recorded 117 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, five sacks, two forced fumbles and an interception in 13 games last fall. At 6-foot-3 and 245 pounds, he’s a bulky-but-fluid linebacker capable of filling multiple roles along the linebacker corps. In this case, he’d pair with Leo Chenal to give the Chiefs two fairy tale-strong ball-stoppers in the second level.

DeepSeek’s catastrophic impact on AI tech firms looks like it’s slowing down. After dropping heavily early last week, the S&P 500 has made a fantastic recovery and now sits very close to its all-time highs. The rebound was largely due to Big Tech stepping up, recording top earnings, and most importantly, reassuring investors that the US is still a leader in AI technology. All in all, DeepSeek might just be a much-needed boost for US AI firms to step up and do better. This also happens to be terrific news for AI projects in the crypto space, who will not only benefit from a dog fight between AI companies worldwide but also from the crypto economy’s overall bullish outlook. If you want to take full advantage of the upcoming AI-crypto rally, here are the 4 best AI agent cryptos you can consider investing into. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is already among the hottest presales of 2025 – and its popularity (and price) will only increase as the hype and demand for AI agent coins are set to skyrocket post DeepSeek’s launch and Altman’s promise of rolling out even better AI models. $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that interacts with folks on online platforms like X and gauges the broader market sentiment. It then uses cutting-edge AI technology to deliver exclusive trading insights to token holders. MIND of Pepe offers two major benefits to token holders: 1. It offers 100% objective analyses, removing all emotions and bias from ruining your crypto profitability 2. It’s able to identify potentially profitable bets when they’re still at their early stages Currently available for just $0.0032532 per token, investing in $MIND could lead to crazy gains in the upcoming bull run. The project has already raised close to $5M. What’s more, early adopters will also be able to make handsome passive income through the project’s 457% staking rewards. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, check out our detailed guide on how to buy $MIND. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET) is the largest AI crypto project on the market right now – it has a market capitalization of over $1.80B. This reflects its popularity and the vote of confidence from investors. $FET is truly a unique project, seeing as it’s a business alliance between three innovative AI companies: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. For context, alliances like this are not common in the AI space, which is still fairly new, meaning every company wants to race past the competition. Not only will this result in more transparency and innovation within the AI economy, but it’ll also level the playing field for smaller, resource-strapped AI companies. Where $MIND aims to offer crypto investment advice to retail traders like you and me, ai16Z is meant to simplify investing for venture capital firms. It will properly vet a company – including studying its financials and mission – to assess whether it’s worth investing into. Not only will this reduce the amount of human labor that goes into studying each prospective investment, but it’ll also massively increase the rate at which investment decisions can be made. Put together, ai16Z can very well be a game changer for venture capitalists. The $AI16Z token is currently trading at $0.38, which is a sizable dip from its all-time highs of around $2.45. However, it’s nearing earlier demand zones (like $0.2), meaning an uptick in price is highly likely from here. Freysa AI offers a fun challenge – convince the AI chatbot to send you money and that money will be yours! The tricky part, of course, is that you’re up against an AI agent designed to protect the very prize pool you’re trying to tap into, which is a pot of crypto. Freysa is admittedly tough to crack, but that’s exactly what’s fueling its hype. After all, who doesn’t love a real (and rewarding) challenge! That GTA V mission you’re trying to complete won’t earn you any money, but this will. The platform offers several game variations, each with a different prize pool – ranging from $7K to $50K. Interestingly, a user actually managed to convince Freysa to send him $20,843 by making the AI agent fall in love with him. With a market cap of over $270M, $FAI is currently trading at $0.034, which makes it one of the cheapest cryptos with massive potential. The larger trend for both crypto and the S&P 500 is expected to be bullish in 2025. However, no amount of market hype should overshadow smart risk management and investment hygiene. This includes only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing and doing your own research before putting your hard-earned money in crypto.

Title: Is DeepSeek China’s Sputnik Moment?
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/is-deepseek-chinas-sputnik-moment
Time Published: 2025-02-03T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, shortly before the start of the Chinese New Year, when much of China shuts down for seven days, the state media saluted DeepSeek, a tech startup whose release of a new low-cost, high-performance artificial-intelligence model, known as R1, prompted a big sell-off in tech stocks on Wall Street. China Central Television showed footage of DeepSeek’s bespectacled founder, Liang Wenfeng, meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the second-highest-ranking official in the Chinese government. A few days earlier, China Daily, an English-language news site run by the Chinese Communist Party, had hailed DeepSeek’s success, which defied U.S. restrictions on the export of high-performance semiconductor chips used to train A.I. models, as “not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a reflection of the broader vibrancy of China’s AI ecosystem.” As if to reinforce the point, on Wednesday, the first day of the Year of the Snake, Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant, released its own new A.I. model, which the company claimed “outperforms” competing products from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Meta “almost across the board.” Alibaba’s claims haven’t been independently verified yet, but the DeepSeek-inspired stock sell-off provoked a great deal of commentary about how the company achieved its breakthrough, the durability of U.S. leadership in A.I., and the wisdom of trying to slow down China’s tech industry by restricting high-tech exports—a policy that both the first Trump Administration and the Biden Administration followed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described R1 as “super impressive,” adding, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Elsewhere, the reaction from Silicon Valley was less effusive. OpenAI said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.” The Chinese company claimed it spent just $5.6 million on computing power to train one of its new models, but Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, another prominent American A.I. firm, described this achievement as merely “an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve,” which U.S. firms would soon match. Amodei did acknowledge the novelty in a Chinese firm being “first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions,” and he argued that DeepSeek’s progress makes “export control policies even more existentially important than they were a week ago.” Such comments demonstrate that how you see the DeepSeek story depends partly on your vantage point. To get an unofficial view from the other side of the Pacific, I arranged a Zoom call with a longtime China watcher, Louis-Vincent Gave, a co-founder of Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based financial services company. Gave, who is fifty and originally from France, moved to Hong Kong in 1997, shortly before the United Kingdom restored control of the former British colony to China. He has lived there ever since, analyzing and writing about China’s remarkable transformation into the world’s second-largest economy and its biggest exporter of goods. On Monday, the day Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company that produces the high-end chips most American A.I. firms rely on, lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value, Gave circulated a commentary entitled “Another Sputnik Moment” to his firm’s clients, which include investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies around the world. (The term “Sputnik moment” had first been applied to DeepSeek by the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.) Given China’s formidable strength in computer engineering and basic scientific research, Gave’s piece said, “fighting a tech battle against (it) always seemed a short-sighted strategy.” In our conversation, he reiterated this argument and said imposing the export restriction on China had been a big mistake, because “it forced them to be very focused.” The battle that Gave referred to started in 2018, when the Trump Administration banned the export of some key components for semiconductors to a Chinese telecommunications company and chipmaker, citing national-security grounds. The Biden Administration strengthened these restrictions several times, particularly as they applied to the most powerful chips made by Nvidia. In announcing the latest set of rules, last month, just a week before Trump’s second Inauguration, then Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “The U.S. leads the world in A.I. now, both A.I. development and A.I. chip design, and it’s critical that we keep it that way.” By then, though, DeepSeek had already released its V3 large language model, and was on the verge of releasing its more specialized R1 model. The firm says it developed both models using lower-end Nvidia chips that didn’t violate the U.S. export bans. “Did DeepSeek happen in spite of the restrictions, or did it happen because of the restrictions?” Gave asked me. To answer his own question, he dived into the past, bringing up the Tiger 1, a German tank deployed during the Second World War which outperformed British and American models despite having a gasoline engine that was less powerful and fuel-efficient than the diesel engines used in British and American models. “I think you could find hundreds of examples through history of necessity being the mother of invention,” he said. “You build a ten-foot wall; I’ll build an eleven-foot ladder. China’s just done this, and everybody is acting surprised.” Some people in the U.S. tech industry have made similar comments. In a post on X, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote, “Engineering is about constraints. The Chinese engineers had limited resources, and they had to find creative solutions.” These workarounds seem to have included limiting the number of calculations that DeepSeek-R1 carries out relative to comparable models, and using the chips that were available to a Chinese company in ways that maximize their capabilities. In another post on X, Andrej Karpathy, a prominent computer scientist who was a co-founder of OpenAI and a former director of A.I. at Tesla, said that DeepSeek was “making it look easy” by training a “frontier-grade” large language model “on a joke of a budget.” Although the theory that imposing resource constraints spurs innovation isn’t universally accepted, it does have some support from other industries and academic studies. A 2014 study of Swiss manufacturers found evidence to support the hypothesis. More recently, in a study of U.S. software startups published in December, two researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of Texas at Austin found firms that didn’t receive any outside funding until later in their development tended to “engage in a greater amount of experimentation with technologies, and also were more likely to carry out more significant changes to their technology stacks.” The evidence is far from definitive; the intuitive counterargument is that having ample access to technical and financial resources facilitates more experimentation than conditions of scarcity. But, in any case, Gave insists that many Westerners have been greatly underestimating the ability of Chinese firms to innovate, rather than merely copy. He said that this tendency was now evident in many industries, including nuclear power, railways, solar panels, and electric vehicles, where the Shenzhen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the biggest E.V. producer in the world. In fact, Gave drew a direct comparison between A.I. and the auto industry. “I’ve heard all the criticisms that, if it wasn’t for OpenAI, DeepSeek couldn’t happen, but you could say exactly the same thing about car companies,” he said. “BYD wouldn’t be here without Tesla. Sure, of course. But the fact remains that BYD is here. And it’s a better car at a cheaper price.” Elon Musk might strenuously dispute that final assertion, but there can be no doubt that the sudden arrival of DeepSeek, following on the heels of the rise of BYD and other Chinese E.V. manufacturers, has raised some awkward questions. “It’s a wake-up call to the West that there is no industry that is one-hundred-per-cent safe,” Gave said. In the American A.I. industry, he went on, the belief had been that if you invested enough in A.I. hardware, you could create a big moat and a lasting monopoly. “That belief has been exploded as well,” Gave added. I asked him what policy guidance he would give to the new Administration in Washington. “My job isn’t to tell policymakers what to do,” he said. “My job is to say, Well, this is happening, how do we make money out of it?” Still, Gave did offer some indirect advice. “The first thing is to acknowledge the reality that China is now leapfrogging the West in industry after industry,” he said. In his opinion, this success reflects some fundamental features of the country, including the fact that it graduates twice as many students in mathematics, science, and engineering as the top five Western countries combined; that it has a large domestic market; and that its government provides extensive support for industrial companies, by, for example, leaning on the country’s banks to extend credit to them. “They said, ‘No more lending to real estate. We need to be an industrial superpower.’ ” Gave’s argument is that this strategy has already succeeded, and the emergence of DeepSeek is the latest and most dramatic evidence. His manner during our conversation was serious but also wry. He noted that, when he posts his arguments about China’s economic progress on YouTube, as he occasionally does, they attract comments that he is spouting C.C.P. propaganda. This seemed to intrigue him rather than worry him. “When it comes to China, there is an emotional response that makes it hard for people to accept simple facts,” he said. ♦

Title: What's Next For CAT Stock After A Bleak Outlook?

Caterpillar excavators are seen in Warsaw, Poland on April 23, 2024. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) recently released its Q4 results, with revenue missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported revenue of $16.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.14 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $16.4 billion and $5.02, respectively. Lower dealer inventory levels weighed on the company’s top-line. Furthermore, the company expects sales and profitability to trend lower this year. Separately, after announcing good results, Buy, Sell, Or Hold ABBV Stock At $185? This didn’t sit well with the investors, and the stock saw a 5% dip on Thursday, January 30. CAT stock, with 29% returns since the beginning of 2024, has performed in-line with the S&P 500 index, up 27%. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Caterpillar’s revenue of $16.2 billion in Q4 was down 5% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the Construction Industries revenue was down 8%, Resource Industries sales were down 9%, while Energy & Transportation revenue were flat y-o-y. Caterpillar saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 60 bps to 18.3% in Q4. A decline in sales clubbed with margin contraction resulted in earnings of $5.14 per share, versus $5.23 in the prior-year quarter. Caterpillar’s sales were weighed down due to lower dealer inventory levels as overall demand remains soft. This can be attributed to elevated interest rates and a high inflationary-environment. Looking forward, Caterpillar expects dealer inventory levels in 2025 to remain similar to levels seen toward the end of 2024. Taking into account the soft demand, Caterpillar will find it difficult to push the pricing higher. In fact, the company expects a slight decline in revenues this year, after seeing a 3% y-o-y decline in 2024. Although Caterpillar posted better than anticipated earnings, a top-line miss and a bleak outlook resulted in its stock seeing a 5% fall post the results announcement. Notably, CAT is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 4 years. But, that still wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 16% in 2021, 19% in 2022, 26% in 2023, and 25% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and geopolitical tensions, could CAT face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for CAT to reflect the latest results, we think its stock is appropriately priced despite its recent decline. At its current levels of $375, CAT stock is trading at 17x trailing earnings of $21.90 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 19x over the last five years. However, a slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the underwhelming outlook for sales as well as profitability in the near term. While CAT stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Caterpillar’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Alphabet (GOOGL-0.08%) is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The Google parent’s stock was up by around 2.2% during mid-day trading on Friday. Alphabet shares are up by more than 8% so far this year. The company is expected to report revenues of $96.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.43%). Net income is expected at $26.2 billion, while analysts estimate earnings of $2.13 per share. In December, Google unveiled Gemini 2.0, which it called its most-capable artificial intelligence model to date for the “new agentic era.” AI agents can complete some complex tasks autonomously for a user. Gemini 2.0's multimodal features, such as native image and audio output, “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,” the company said. With the new AI model’s reasoning capabilities, Google said its AI Overviews feature, which reaches one billion people, will be able to solve advanced multi-step queries, such as mathematical equations and multimodal questions. On Thursday, Google announced the rollout of its Gemini 2.0 Flash model to the Gemini mobile app and website. Meanwhile, Demis Hassabis, founder of Alphabet’s drug discovery subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, said its AI-designed drugs are expected to head to trial by the end of the year. “AI applied to science is a lot richer than just the language models,” Hassabis, who also serves as chief executive of Google DeepMind, said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ll hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in the clinic by the end of the year. That’s the plan.” Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind, announced deals in July to work with Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY+3.43%) and Novartis (NVS-2.69%) on drug research using its AlphaFold AI model.

Title: How corporate America got DEI wrong
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5281168/corporate-america-dei-trump-diversity-business-stakeholder-capitalism
Time Published: 2025-02-03T10:00:00Z

By Maria Aspan An American flag flies outside a Walmart store in Miami. In 2020, Walmart was one of many large U.S. companies that pledged to fight racism and increase internal diversity. But now it, Amazon, Facebook and many other companies are ending some of those programs. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Five years ago, in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the sweeping reckoning on racism it sparked, corporate America rushed to join in. Big businesses started making big — and expensive — promises to fight racism and increase diversity. Walmart, the world's largest company, spent $100 million on a new center on racial equity — and that was just one of many such investments. All told, the country's largest companies pledged almost $50 billion toward addressing racial inequality in the year after Floyd's death, The Washington Post estimated in 2021. And their CEOs announced these promises with solemn rhetoric about their companies' roles in fixing societal problems. "We want to address systematic racism in society head-on and accelerate change," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in June 2020. But today, corporate America is rushing just as quickly in the other direction. Mounting political and legal attacks have turned DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — from a corporate rallying cry to a politically toxic football. Many big companies had been backing away from their diversity promises even before President Trump was reelected. After long criticizing DEI, Trump last month signed executive orders that will terminate what he calls "illegal" DEI programs and policies throughout the federal government. He called the programs "radical and wasteful" and discriminatory against nonminorities who, he says, are denied opportunities and recognition as a result. Trump continued these criticisms last week, suggesting — apparently without evidence — that DEI programs at the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for a deadly airliner crash. It may seem that big companies are just adapting to political and legal pressure, but diversity experts also blame a more fundamental failure: Many businesses didn't think through their pledges — or their costs — from the start, they say. So corporate America may have never gotten DEI right in the first place. "What we're seeing in the moment is the few companies who took it to heart … and the many who just wanted to sprinkle some DEI on top, especially after George Floyd," says Portia Allen-Kyle, who runs the racial justice nonprofit Color of Change. "And that was never going to be a viable strategy." Allen-Kyle is pretty pessimistic these days about the future of DEI in corporate America, and the fallout for Black and other minority workers. But some diversity experts see a silver lining from the scrutiny: They hope that companies that care about building fairer, more inclusive workplaces are rethinking their strategies — and may now finally have a chance to get it right. Conservative critics have long claimed that DEI is itself discriminatory. But these attacks picked up momentum in 2023, when the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action at colleges and universities, ending the consideration of race in college admissions. President Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20. Jim Watson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption That ruling handed a powerful legal weapon to anti-DEI voices like Robby Starbuck, a social media influencer who has successfully pressured several big companies to end diversity-focused programs. Starbuck has said he is focused on ending "wokeness" in corporate America and has posted on X that his activism will give workers "a neutral workplace without feeling that divisive issues are being injected." Now President Trump's efforts to end DEI in the federal government are expected to ripple into the private sector. Walmart, Meta, Amazon and many others have already joined the retreat, ending many of their 2020-era pledges and programs. For example, Walmart in November said it won't renew the funding for its racial equity center and that it will end some other diversity-focused programs. "We remain committed to creating a culture where everyone can be successful, and ensuring we are a Walmart for everyone," a company spokesperson tells NPR. The other companies have said similar things. For example, in a note shared with NPR, Amazon executive Candi Castleberry told employees last year that "we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world." (Meta did not respond to a request for comment.) Under the political headlines, there's a more subtle undercurrent at work. When Floyd was murdered, many big companies were already promoting themselves as leaders in society, not just business. This widespread trend was known as "stakeholder capitalism": Companies argued that they could do more to help workers, society and the planet, while also making more money for investors. But many experts saw this rhetoric as fundamentally flawed — and, it soon turned out, largely ineffective. Paying workers more inevitably costs money and cuts into short-term profits; so does turning down business opportunities that could have a negative impact on the environment. Meanwhile, CEOs who take stands on social or environmental issues risk drawing the ire of politicians and customers who disagree. "It is always going to be difficult, if you are a for-profit publicly traded company, to have your leader talk about anything other than maximizing profits," says Sekou Bermiss, an associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "That is, in the U.S., the way we are wired." But when Floyd was murdered, big companies had raised the expectations of employees and customers that they would take a stand. And Bermiss argues that many rushed into promises without thinking through the costs — or what made the most sense for each individual business. Instead, some companies relied too much on the prospect of financial rewards for DEI programs, or what became known as "the business case for diversity." "It was being pitched as 'Diversity is always going to help the bottom line,' Bermiss says. "But no one [who studies this] would ever say that." Indeed, although some analysts have made the business case for diversity, Bermiss' research has found that when companies increase the diversity of their executive teams, they generally don't see a financial impact — good or bad. Still, Bermiss and others point out that DEI policies can have significant business impacts, even if they're not apparent in short-term financial results. Having a more diverse team can help create products that appeal to more consumers, or help employees feel more satisfied with their jobs. Costco, for example, recently told investors that its DEI efforts "help bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings" and "enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed," among other benefits. The massive retailer, which also calls DEI part of its "code of ethics," successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the nation's largest bank, has called DEI "good for business; it's morally right; we're quite good at it; we're successful." Costco successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption It probably helps that both JPMorgan Chase and Costco are financial powerhouses, whose profits and share prices keep their investors happy. But both companies are also framing their DEI policies as a matter of morality or ethics, rather than just profits. That's exactly how more companies should be thinking about DEI, according to Bermiss — if (and only if) they see it as valuable. Bermiss acknowledges that not all companies will want to continue pursuing greater diversity, equity and inclusion. But he argues that if business leaders decide that pursuing such workplace goals is morally right and aligned with a company's values, then they'll be better able to stand up to criticisms or attacks. And, as he adds, that's firmer ground than hoping that "if we get two more Latinos on the board, our stock price will go up." Despite the ongoing pressures, Costco and JPMorgan aren't the only employers still spending money on DEI. In fact, some companies are ramping up: Paradigm, a tech consultancy that advises employers on diversity and inclusion, says it saw a 12 percentage-point increase last year in how many of its customers had dedicated DEI budgets. Paradigm CEO Joelle Emerson says that even companies that are ending DEI programs may rebrand the work rather than abandoning it altogether. Corporate America's diversity results have been "a mixed bag," she adds, "in part because companies often spent too much time and energy on initiatives that didn't have a measurable impact." Now she's hoping that employers are taking the time to create more thoughtful — and effective — programs to increase fairness. "I see this less as a rollback of DEI and more as sort of an evolution to the next phase of this work," Emerson says. Many of the companies ending DEI programs are scrubbing the now-politically toxic acronym from their websites and corporate statements. But their public statements insist that they still want to make everyone feel included. That could be a tricky balance, especially as the Trump administration continues ramping up attacks on DEI — including efforts to uncover rebranded diversity efforts inside federal agencies. And it remains to be seen whether corporate America can really be more effective while softening its language — and goals — around diversity, equity and inclusion. But Emerson, at least, is bullish. "I'm actually pretty optimistic about the future of this work," she says. "I'm not optimistic about the acronym DEI — nor do I particularly care." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘I Think CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Is Going Up Big From Here’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer looked closely at. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the impact of President Donald Trump’s first few weeks in office on the financial markets. Cramer pointed out that while some investors had expected severe tariffs under Trump’s administration, many have begun to believe that these expectations may be exaggerated. According to Cramer, Wall Street initially became excited about a potentially more flexible approach under Trump. Investors were concerned that Trump might take a hard stance against Mexico and Canada, but as the situation developed, it became clear that his actions would not be as extreme as initially feared. He added: “Before taking the White House, he talked about putting 25% tariffs on our two longstanding trading partners immediately but then when the America First Trade policy memo came out, we saw that the administration wants to study the situation.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently Cramer remarked that although Trump had made bold statements about renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America," his actual policies have been more tempered. Cramer noted that if Trump can find someone in Canada willing to negotiate, he would pursue that, and he’s already receiving business-like responses from Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum. He added: “Again, the rhetoric was hot, but the reality was cool. Sure there are some real harsh words for a lot of the environmental rules and regulations and grants that President Biden jammed through the last four years. Trump has no time for these.” In addition to trade policies, Cramer also commented on Trump’s stance regarding environmental regulations. Trump has made it clear that he has no patience for many of the environmental rules and grants implemented during the previous administration. Cramer pointed out that Trump views oil and gas as essential to America’s economic strength, believing that increased drilling and production would lead to lower oil prices and enhance U.S. power abroad. However, Cramer acknowledged that it’s unclear how much influence Trump can exert over the oil and gas industry. He emphasized the need for more infrastructure, particularly pipelines, to facilitate both domestic and international distribution of natural gas. While oil executives are aware of the political pressure to increase production, they also know that any loss of discipline in response to presidential demands could lead to plummeting prices and financial losses. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on January 21. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Cramer mentioned that CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock will gain from here and recommended buying the stock. “I think CrowdStrike is going up big from here. I think that [the] cybersecurity business is terrific. I think that they are just now beginning to play offense after that glitch that occurred. I do think that this is the time to own CrowdStrike and to own what George Kurtz has built.” CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company known for its Falcon platform, which provides various endpoint security solutions. In November 2024, Cramer mentioned the company and remarked: “Hey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.” CrowdStrike’s (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock has gained more than 30% since its outage in July 2024. Overall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently looked at. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI-Briefing: DeepSeek’s emergence from nowhere shows open-source is eating the world
URL: http://digiday.com/media/ai-briefing-deepseeks-emergence-from-nowhere-shows-open-source-is-eating-the-world/
Time Published: 2025-02-03T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
In case you have been hiding under a rock for the past week, DeepSeek’s emergence (seemingly out of nowhere) has underlined the geopolitical aspect of one of the most disruptive forces in economic history. A key question facing the $225 billion-plus U.S. digital media sector is, how will its key players respond? Developments last week hint at such players adopting an open-source approach in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. Meanwhile, Digiday’s ad tech sources noted that, while DeepSeek poses a credible alternative to Big Tech, clients are in a cautious mood, particularly around privacy. The market disruption wrought by the technical feats of China-based DeepSeek’s new R1 large language model developed at a fraction of the cost of U.S. rival and AI talisman OpenAI and ChatGPT was demonstrated in stock prices. Notably, Nvidia, a leading supplier of GPUs essential for AI development, experienced a record one-day market value loss of approximately $593 billion, marking the largest single-day loss for any company to date. Meanwhile, the resulting impact on the market capitalization drops of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft — collectively, these companies dominate the ad-funded internet — were declines ranging from 5% to 10% in a similar period. The key to DeepSeek’s emergence was its open-source approach to developing its R1 model. This contrasts with OpenAI’s more proprietary strategy, where models are typically closed-source and access is provided through APIs. Despite the political tenor of the development, as exemplified by the privacy concerns flagged by Digiday sources, some of the internet economy’s foundational names are making moves that hint at an open future. For example, DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available on AWS, a sign (for some) of how the Amazon machine views others’ margin as its opportunity and will do whatever it takes to push its infrastructure strategy. One ad tech founder said potential clients are asking them to make sure they don’t use tech owned by companies like Amazon and Google, which makes having an alternative even more appealing. However, ad tech companies are still wary of using DeepSeek’s API and instead are looking for other options like running R1 on-premise. Elsewhere, some have noted the timing of Google’s Meridian — the online advertising giant’s open-source marketing mix model (MMM) — last week as significant. As Digiday sources recently observed, measurement is at the core of Google’s indispensableness in any media plan. However, as discussed extensively at last week’s annual leadership meeting hosted by the IAB, the loss of traditional audience-targeting signals, primarily third-party cookies, means Google’s ability to calculate how ads drive purchases is waning. Some interpret this embrace of the open approach from traditional walled garden players as a significant shift in their approach. Given the disruptive impact of AI on Google’s search hegemony, observers speculate if similar significant shifts in outlook can be expected from the titans of Big Tech. And the potential for downstream impacts are manifold, with ad tech sources telling Dgiday in separate conversations last week that they believe open-source models give them a chance to “control our own destiny.” Buy-side and sell-side sources told Digiday that R1’s transparency creates an alternative to black boxes like OpenAI and also offers them the opportunity to rely less on storing data with competitors like Google and Amazon. That doesn’t mean the Big Four won’t have a moat, but it does mean the moat’s eroded — at least for now. Meanwhile, OpenAI-patron Microsoft reported its latest earnings report last week, with CEO Satya Nadella declaring its AI business was approaching a run rate of $13 billion per year, up 175% year over year. This lofty figure failed to impress markets, though, as a comparatively modest revenue outlook for the coming quarter, along with residual concerns over the impact of DeepSeek, proved a drag on Microsoft’s stock price after earnings. Elsewhere, Apple also issued its earnings last week, and while its subsequent stock price fluctuations may have fared more stably than others in its Big Tech cohort, some noted how it will have to accelerate its AI deployment, i.e. Apple Intelligence, if it is to gain momentum. Given Apple’s increasing interest in the “services” sector, which increased 14% year on year for the reporting period to surpass $26 billion, and advertising in particular, it will be interesting to see just how AI will play a role in its Madison Avenue aspirations. Chris Vanderhook, COO and co-founder of publicly-listed ad tech company Viant, noted how the recent developments have been significant. “Because AI adoption is so early, they [Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.] didn’t get their hooks and claws into everyone yet,” he told Digiday. Content creators in Roblox, which the company often refers to as “developers,” are a very different beast from creators on other platforms. Some podcast execs expanding their video production efforts aren’t won over by Spotify’s push into video podcasts yet, due in part to growth they’re seeing on YouTube. The company believes more creators will make the jump to LinkedIn for the opportunity to be in front of marketers, investors and other business decision-makers.

I am an uber one member, but there is no mention of it being an uber one offer. Have attached a screenshot of what the banner looks like in post description Banner link from my second account If you have the deal it will show list of restaurants with red text "save on select items" Worked for me. $1.99 whopper with cheese after following your link dont see this on any of my two uber one accounts Not seeing it on my one account either. I found one item from a burger joint in my area, 81% off (Mofo Burgers carlton) Not currently Uber one member edit. Includes a bunch of fast food including red rooster, Betty's etc. It has worked for me and I don’t have uber one. $4.50 for a big boss burger at burger point Marsden Park. No Uber One here and yeah, hard to find places that have it but looks like Betty's Burgers and Red Rooster at least. Thank you OP Not much available except drab burgers. Hopefully some better offers around dinnertime. Thank you for sharing. Yeah got it too. It looks to be associated with Ubers current Cher promotions. All I have in my area is HJ’s and Red Rooster. Actually, every time you close it and reopen it, it changes the places. Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Strange when I refresh the Cher page the options do keep shuffling. The places don't change for me, just some disappear and reappear upon refresh Got a whopper cheese delivered for $5, thanks :) Not a uber one member and got the offer looks like pick up too nice edit: went with Barnacle Bills Chicken Burger, Chips and Coke for $3.97. Bargain. Appears to work with more than one order if you add two or more orders to cart before proceeding to pay for each seperately. I paid for two separate orders and the promotion applied to both. confirm this works Got one as a non-One member. Filter by "Offers" and every store with "Save on select items" will have something that's 80% off Scheduled a Beef Bacon Cheeseburger and Chips (RRP $21.50) from my local pub for $7 delivered. First time I've used UE in months. Thanks OP. Note not all stores with "save on select items". There are stores with that badge that won't have 80% off. Ah sorry - I checked 5 stores and they all had a discount in them. I think maybe they were pizza/burger type places so just got lucky (or unlucky) I guess. Got two separate orders burgers only? Works for burgers and pizza. Managed to get 4 orders before it stopped working. Chargrill Charlie, Betty’s work too Wanna know why these types of offers keep being restricted so much? Because of (inflammatory) like above abusing it and then bragging about it. and yet they still keep getting the deal? This is something for uber to fix on their end. think I got it but just 1 store after few browses. Got Fat Jak Johnny cheeseburger for $3.42 ex delivery/services thanks OP!! best ubereats deal in years! 2 pizzas for $10 👍 Pizza for $1.39 delivered 😂 I didn't get the Cher banner (and I'm not an Uber One member), but was able to find that some stores near me (Red Rooster, Chicken Treat, HJs) had the offer available. $1.99 Whopper with cheese for me… Same, but no pick up option. Mandatory Delivery fee is $6.49 for just 1.3km away makes it a non-deal. Time to try out other venues with cheaper delivery then. Thanks OP. Thank you for making me feel better about ordering uber eats tonight (I was going to do it anyway) Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Whooper is the only option at the time of writing. No sub and no use for long. Only offer in mine is 1.99 whopper. Has a $14.99 delivery fee attached, apparently due to current high demand. It’s 6.30am on a Tuesday. I’m an uber one member. No option for pickup. how do i get to it ?? Seems like its per day? Ordered yesterday - and the banner is back up again mine went from 8-10 options to just two after the first order. And no options for pickup. So it's confirmed promo not single use? Is it once per day or per restaurant (as in can you order from different eligible restaurants on the same day and still utilise the discount or does it re-set each day after single use)? I found that also, I've got 2 orders for Betty's burgers from two different locations on the same day, last time was yum OK sounds like it's once per restaurant then… if you managed to place 2 orders on the same day at different restaurants (albeit the same chain)? Maybe that's potentially why people are seeing less options the next day, even though the promo is still active on their account? Scummy of them to offer this only on the app which scrapes your data to sell to the highest bidder. I can access it on desktop too Where on desktop? I can't see anything with 80% off. from this link @CodeXD: Will give it a shot. Thanks. Edit: doesn't seem to come up on any of my accounts. Ordered yesterday, offer still shows today but much smaller selection (HJ’s Red Rooster and Betty’s) same Chargrill Charlie's is also on that list if one nearby, 1/4 chicken and chips by the way the promotion shows up on stores if you try to add items after ordering at another restaurant. I ordered two Whopper Cheese via HJ's, then I added a $5.60 meal from Betty's Burger, making the total to about $9 (without paying for delivery via uber one) You need to do this pretty fast before the offer expires, so I'd recommend those looking to use this trick to build the carts before ordering - it means you should just be able to enter each one and order before the promotion disappears. My local Hungry Jack's would let me add two Whopper with Cheese initially, but went I went to Cart, it said I exceeded the limit, and charges delivery + service fees. When I switched to an address in the city it allowed me to add two Whopper, charges service fees but not delivery fees. Got a Betty fried chicken burger (with pineapple) meal for $4.73 pick up. Good price. There's like 2 places in Sydney doing pick-up, rest are delivery only but as it's over $20 that's easy enough. Got a woodfired pizza from the local Italian restaurant for $5.60 delivered. No Uber One. Thanks OP Cheers OP, I was able to order 4 Whopper Cheese for $8.72. Back-to-back orders… or different accounts? If neither, what's the steps for ordering multiple burgers per order (as seems to be limited to one Whopper for me)? :) 1 order on 1 account. It depends on the branch as it was only possible add as many as you like at the LaTrobe St. branch.

Watch CBS News Updated on: February 2, 2025 / 6:24 PM EST / CBS News On this "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump picks a tariff fight with America's top trade partners, federal workers brace for another tumultuous week, and the fallout continues from Mr. Trump blaming diversity policies for the midair collision of an Army Black Hawk and a passenger jet. Washington and the rest of the world are waking up to what feels like a new reality show, as President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, despite the confusion and controversy surrounding some of them. We will talk with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Brian Mast. On the good news front, American Keith Siegel has a happy family reunion following his release from Hamas captivity. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. One of the president's biggest campaign promises was to enact steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Saturday night, he did just that. And the move has already sparked international backlash and sent chills through the financial world. We begin with senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama – Ed. ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, good morning. These are sweeping tariffs, the present using a 1977 law to suggest there is now an extraordinary threat from fentanyl and illegal immigration and that all three countries are failing to address those challenges. So, starting Tuesday, there will be 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican exports, 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian exports, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian energy exports and 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China. This morning, the president acknowledged this could lead to higher prices, writing: "Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not," he wrote on his social media platform, "but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid." MARGARET BRENNAN: This has triggered a trade war. Canada's prime minister announced tariffs on American beer, bourbon, wine, lumber, fruits, clothing, appliances. So, Ed, what else should we expect is coming that could hurt American consumers? ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks. Now, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke directly to Americans last night, warning the tariffs – quote – "will put your jobs at risk," potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. And he said Canada's planned dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs will raise American grocery and gas prices. And while President Trump accused Mexico of having an alliance with drug cartels, President Claudia Sheinbaum said: "If such alliances exist anywhere, they exist in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to criminal groups." And China says it firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests. It is planning to protest these tariffs to the World Trade Organization. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, what's on Secretary Rubio's agenda in Panama? ED O'KEEFE: Yes, well, you know, Rubio, of course, the first Latino secretary of state, so he is taking his first overseas mission here to Central America and the Caribbean to reiterate President Trump's concern that China now has too much influence over the Panama Canal. The Panamanians insist they have full control – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Ed. We go now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and joins us from Palm Beach, Florida. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax with the big game coming next week, if – avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, prices going to go up. The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours, like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is a – remember, Donald Trump got hired trying to lower – saying he was going to lower grocery prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Two weeks in, he's doing something that's going to do the absolute opposite. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will track the impact of this trade war. Senator, I want to switch topics. You are, as we said, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard. She had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball, but listen to what happened. (Begin VT) SENATOR TED BUDD (R-North Carolina): Did he betray a duty, did he betray the trust of the American people? Which is – according to Merriam-Webster, that's the definition of a traitor. FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Edward Snowden broke the law and he released this information in a way that he should not have. He also acknowledged and exposed information that was unconstitutional. SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-Oklahoma): Was he a traitor at the time when he took America's secrets, released them in public, and then ran to China and became a Russian citizen? FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD: Senator, I'm focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You have worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that, her refusal to call him a traitor, and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden – she called him a brave whistle-blower – couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that – what signal, if she got in, would that send to the I.C. workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law, if she called Snowden a brave whistle-blower? And MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is, our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law. That's based on trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traitors in recent American history as such, as a traitor? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate? SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number – our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that – as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But – and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called – or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: … that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities – agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation – that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were – almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations? This would be devastating. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's – well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret – Margaret, it – we have seen – but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like – it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for. But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air – the crash. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them? SENATOR MARK WARNER: … without legal authority. Pardon me. Say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to – is it being offered to air traffic controllers? SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is – I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on. And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs. What happens if they all quit? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you – and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents. I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment. I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away? SENATOR MARK WARNER: No. I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo. Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example – down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution. And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs. He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was – President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid. These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing… MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority? MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad… MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … when it should be the American worker's dollar. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … which is a – separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell – yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents… MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently. And let's make another point on this as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress – Congress authorizes and earmarks funding. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars – most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So – I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure. I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say – this is a little bit hyperbole – but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about – you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change. MARGARET BRENNAN: … efficiencies in aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's… MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what? MARGARET BRENNAN: But… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place? MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put – that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility – disability. Excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it. Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal – a personal aircraft. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont. Good morning to you, Senator. Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe. But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well. And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: … not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator – Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it. Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break. I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week. Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time. One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen. (BEGIN VC) SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine? (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy. But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism - MARGARET BRENNAN: But - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that - MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower. And, by the way, it's not just health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address. MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane. And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out? FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of "The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists? SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions. Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, "line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do." Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here. But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation? SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Macfarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom lining it. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning. Good morning. You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing? HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today. He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon? HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure? HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did. I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them. So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, "it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through? HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu. This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through. I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three. HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen - HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well. HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk. HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: These are Americans who need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hanna, thank you. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you so much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And congratulations. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's great news. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we go, "CBS Evening News" co-anchor and presidential historian John Dickerson has some thoughts on the tone of those Oval Office moments following tragedy. (BEGIN VT) JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): After the deadliest air crash in 20 years in America, President Trump responded, as presidents have before. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Differences fade because we are all reminded of the basic truth, that we are all human and life is fragile. In such rare moments, a president can transform private grief into public meaning. These presidential moments live in our collective memory. Ronald Reagan addressing the nation after the Challenger disaster. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): George W. Bush at Ground Zero. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The nation sends its love and compassion. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Barack Obama singing at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (singing): Amazing grace. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): In speech, by bull horn, in song, and now, by executive memorandum. That's how Donald Trump used the Oval Office where Reagan had eulogized the Challenger astronauts. Though the president had earlier declared an hour of anguish for our nation, for him, the hour only lasted a few minutes. He spent much of the remainder of this unique moment distributing blame. TRUMP: I put safety first. Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The starkest claim, the one behind the Oval Office signing ceremony, that diversity programs had caused the crash that killed 67. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a presidential memorandum titled Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety. In light of the damage done to aviation safety by the Biden administration's DEI and woke policies. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): When asked what proof he had that diversity was the culprit, and the president said he had no proof but didn't need any. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash. TRUMP: Because I have common sense, OK. And, unfortunately, a lot of people don't. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The president's certainty about the crash, despite the lack of proof, suggested for many Americans that the common sense he was referring to was that diversity means things automatically go wrong when people of color are in charge. In one press conference he traveled the entire length of the emotional register, from asserting that the differences between Americans fade to returning the focus to those differences. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Dub: the copy trading app that has teens talking

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Social media changed everything, from news consumption to shopping. Now, Dub thinks it can do the same for investing through an influencer-driven marketplace where users can follow the trades of top investors with a few taps. Think of it as TikTok meets Wall Street. Founded by 23-year-old Steven Wang — a Harvard dropout who began investing in second grade with his parents’ blessing — Dub is betting the future of investing isn’t about picking stocks but picking people. The app allows users to follow the strategies of traders, hedge funds, and even those mimicking high-profile politicians. Instead of making individual trade decisions, Dub users can copy entire portfolios. The concept has struck a chord. Dub has already surpassed 800,000 downloads and raised $17 million in seed funding — with a new round seemingly in the works. Less clear is whether Dub can avoid the pitfalls of previous fintech startups. Retail investing has evolved dramatically over the past two decades. The days of $7 trading commissions and clunky brokerage interfaces were blown apart roughly a decade ago by mobile-first platforms like Robinhood that invited people to trade for free. At the same time, social media is reshaping how people, and particularly members of Gen Z, make financial decisions. As a Harvard student during the pandemic — one who was trading from his dorm room “because you couldn’t really do anything at school” — Wang came to believe these two trends, retail investing and influencer-driven decision-making, were on a collision course. Between the GameStop saga, Elon Musk’s ability to “move the Dogecoin and Bitcoin markets with every tweet,” and people’s willingness to “really follow ideas and individuals to a whole new level,” Wang decided to drop out in 2021 and start building Dub. Right now, the platform’s average user is between the ages of 30 and 35, says Wang, though New York-based Dub is clearly finding its way in front of an even younger audience. In recent weeks, this editor’s 15-year-old has asked more than once about “investing like Nancy Pelosi” after marinating in Dub ads on Instagram. Pelosi isn’t personally trading on Dub; it’s just a trader on the platform mirroring her disclosed moves. Still, the idea has caught fire. “Nancy Pelosi is up 123% on Dub with real capital,” says Wang, “and we’ve made our customers millions of dollars since that portfolio was launched on the platform.” Dub isn’t free. Wang was determined to generate revenue from the outset, and Dub does that today through a $10-per-month subscription model. Wang says further that some “top” portfolios on the platform charge management fees and Dub takes a 25% cut of those fees. In the meantime, Dub has scaled in part through organic growth. “Creators who are good traders on the app are incentivized to bring their audience,” says Wang, whose parents immigrated from China and who grew up in Detroit. Dub is also investing aggressively in advertising, leaning heavily into Meta ads in particular to acquire users, including on Instagram. “We’ve been really lucky where I think the broader American population really believes there are other people out there that have an edge over them when it comes to the investing world,” says Wang. The question now is whether Dub will follow a similar path as other fast-growing fintech startups, many of which have found themselves in the crosshairs of regulators. Robinhood disrupted finance by making trading free, but it also faced regulatory scrutiny ahead of its 2021 IPO, ultimately ditching a feature that showered users with digital confetti every time they made a trade. Dub says it’s keen to avoid the same mistakes. The company spent more than two years working with FINRA and the SEC before launching, ensuring its model complied with financial regulations. “We didn’t just navigate regulation at Dub — we embraced it,” Wang says. (Like Robinhood, Dub is a fully licensed broker-dealer.) A big distinction, argues Wang, is that Dub is designed to educate users, not just encourage blind speculation. The platform displays risk scores, risk-adjusted returns, and portfolio stability metrics to help investors make informed decisions, he says. He suggests it’s safer for investors than Robinhood. Says Wang: “I have a lot of respect for what [CEO] Vlad [Tenev] has done in making trading free. But at the end of the day, making it super easy to trade without expert guidance, without education, is really just gambling for the broader population.” To underscore his point, Wang points to the decision of Robinhood — along with Coinbase and other exchanges — to make the meme coin TRUMP available for customers ahead of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While it initially surged in price, its price has plummeted since. Says Wang, “I think fundamentally the incentives are just misaligned between these big platforms that are public companies now that need to make money” and that “generally” their customers have “probably lost money.” (Worth noting: In a separate, recent conversation with Robinhood’s Tenev about Dub, Tenev proposed to TechCrunch that copy trading could become of greater interest to regulators and that Dub may not yet be under the “magnifying glass” because of its comparatively smaller size.) Either way, not everyone is sold on Dub’s vision. The biggest knock against such platforms, says critics, is that stock picking underperforms passive investing over the long run, with studies showing that most actively managed funds fail to beat the S&P 500. It’s a criticism with which Wang is familiar — and on which he’s quick to push back. For one thing, he argues that many such studies are “cherry-picked.” (“I bet a lot of those are sponsored by the passive investing index companies,” he says.) Further, says Wang, there’s a reason that actively managed hedge funds like Citadel are thriving. “If you look at what the ultra wealthy can do, they’re giving their money to Ken Griffin of Citadel, [because] they’re consistently putting up non-correlated returns year after year after year,” he says. If one more broadly “looks at the growth of the hedge fund space and the asset management space,” continues Wang, “there’s a reason why it’s growing. It’s because they are making money for their customers.” Topics Editor in Chief & General Manager Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks For The Next 5 Years

Time Published: 2025-02-02T18:00:00Z

Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks For The Next 5 Years
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-stocks-for-next-5-years/
Time Published: 2025-02-02T18:00:00Z

Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/02/3-high-yield-closed-end-funds-to-buy-tech-stocks-for-less/
Time Published: 2025-02-02T15:41:00Z
Full Content:
Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: What's in store for remote work and RTO in 2025: 'Hybrid will be dominant,' says expert
URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/02/whats-in-store-for-remote-work-and-rto-in-2025.html
Time Published: 2025-02-02T14:30:01Z

Related Stories With the new year comes new goals, and for some CEOs that includes issuing fresh return-to-office mandates for their workers. In recent months, companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell and Walmart have called select staffers into the office five days a week. RTO marching orders reached the White House after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all department and agency heads in the executive branch to "terminate remote work arrangements" and require workers report to offices full-time "as soon as practicable." Shortly after, the Trump administration offered buyouts to nearly all civilian federal workers to quit by Feb. 6. The trend could trigger waves of quitting and disengagement at work, though, experts warn, especially among high performers. Nearly half, 46%, of hybrid and remote workers said they would be unlikely to stay in their job if their employer called them back to offices full-time, according to a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,200 people in October. Some companies may hope that work-from-home holdouts will quit rather than comply. Companies that plan to cut hiring significantly are more likely to impose RTO mandates than expand remote-work opportunities, according to research from ZipRecruiter; they also report higher turnover rates. In the past, the workers most likely to quit after the institution of an RTO mandate tended to be highly skilled and tenured star employees, according to research from the University of Pittsburgh. The study, which analyzed companies in the S&P 500, found firms that cut workplace flexibility experienced "abnormally high turnover," especially among women, senior and skilled employees. These companies took "significantly longer" to fill vacancies and saw their hire rates "significantly decrease," researchers noted. Thanks to a tougher job market for workers than a few years ago, those who want to quit but don't have anywhere to go are likely to stay and be a drain on worker engagement, says Mark Ma, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. "I might try to do the minimum so I won't be fired, then start looking for the next job. And once I find a better position, I will leave," Ma says. "So it's not an ideal situation for the employer." A better approach to reducing headcount is to conduct targeted layoffs of lower performers, Ma says. As of October 2024, a majority of workers, 53%, said finding a new job they want would be difficult, up from 37% of people who felt that way in 2022, according to Pew data. That's unlikely to entirely deter the nearly half of workers who would try to quit given stricter RTO mandates from their company. "It shows how much they really do value the flexibility that comes with hybrid work," says Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew Research Center. Generally, Ma expects "some form of hybrid will be dominant, rather than a five-day return-to-office." Of the S&P 500 firms he and his co-researchers studied in 2024, just 10 announced full-time returns for some of its staff throughout the year, he says. "Based on the data we are observing, I do not think the majority of companies will do that," he says. "Most firms have already figured out their hybrid policy by now. Unless something goes wrong, I don't think they will try to change that position." While 31% of businesses reduced remote-work options in 2024, 33% expanded them, according to ZipRecruiter data compiled from more than 2,000 hiring managers. Bigger companies may have more leverage to issue RTO requirements because they can offer more money and still attract a larger candidate pool, Ma says. However, smaller companies that can't offer as competitive pay might instead offer more flexibility as a non-salary benefit to attract hires. "Not many small firms are following," Ma says.

Title: Why Are Analysts Bullish on MGM Resorts International (MGM) Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. 2024 was a memorable year for the broad market index, which posted a gain of 23.31%, building on the 24.2% return in 2023. The two-year surge of over 53% is the best performance for the index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998. READ ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. The broader market rose 0.5% on January 23, going past its peak in December to a new record high. The gain added to the week-long winning momentum after data showed inflation slowing in the country more than economists had anticipated. With this rise, the index is up 4% since the start of the year. Investor sentiment has also been bolstered with President Trump reiterating his commitment to lowering oil prices and further cutting interest rates. The 78-year-old is also taking his time over tariffs by holding them off until February. Analysts believe a less aggressive approach than some had expected has helped the market move higher. Here is what Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, had to say: "He really can’t control interest rates, but the market likes to hear that kind of stuff. So far, the market does seem to like what Trump’s policies are going to be, so we’ll just have to see if there’s some follow-through." A string of strong corporate earnings reports has also supported the gains in January. According to data from FactSet, earnings for companies listed on the index are on track to grow by over 12% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. If that happens, this would mark the best quarter for company profits since 2021. While the overall outlook for the stock market looks encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the rally having gone too far, and a correction is in the offing this year. The threat of fierce trade wars sparked by tariffs, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and broader inflationary pressures could also hurt the market. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro for Fidelity Management & Research Company wrote the following in a note on December 18. "Personally, I am bullish on stocks for 2025, though with valuations high and the bull market maturing, I don’t think investors should expect quite such spectacular returns next year as we have seen this past year. And I think there are important risks from inflation, and the market’s concentration, to be aware of."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index. This is higher than the 11.8% growth consensus had expected on Dec. 31, per FactSet data. And FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out this reporting season has been a particularly strong one for companies that are surprising Wall Street to the upside with their earnings per share numbers. Analyzing the two days leading into and following a report, companies that beat Wall Street's earnings expectations have seen their stocks rise 1.5% on average. This is above the five-year average of a 1% rise for companies that top earnings estimates. And it's not just this quarter's earnings surprising, either. Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha pointed out in a note to clients that at this point in the quarter, earnings estimates would usually have been cut 1.3%. Instead, they've only been trimmed by 0.6%. In other words, while noise about tariffs, inflation, and the overall path of monetary policy continues to dominate the discussion, the strong trend in earnings continues to be what's keeping Wall Street strategists bullish about the market outlook. "The most steady part of this bull market has been ... those earnings trends. Those forward earnings estimates every week are making new highs," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. "All in all, we think the bull market trend is intact, supported by these earnings that are somewhat still underappreciated." Another bullish sign for earnings may soon be flashing green too. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its ISM Manufacturing PMI. The reading has shown the sector in contraction for more than two years. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave believes the tide may be turning for manufacturing, though. "The manufacturing recession might be over, and we think the ISM manufacturing index is likely to break above 50 in January," Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This could be bullish for stocks, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook. "To me, the most important chart to watch is the ISM manufacturing turning up in 2025," Lee said. "This series has been below 50 for 26 months now, the longest stretch since 1989-1991, and we think [it] signals an acceleration of cyclical [earnings] growth in 2025." As Lee's chart shows, when ISM's manufacturing PMI picks up, earnings usually follow. Monday Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.1 expected, 50.1 previously); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (0.2% expected, 0% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (49.3 expected, 49.3 prior) Earnings: The Clorox Company (CLX), Palantir (PLTR), Tyson (TSN) Tuesday Economic data: Job openings, December (8.01 million previously); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, -0.4% previously); Durable goods orders, December final (-2.2% previously), Capital Goods orders nondefense, excluding air, December final (+0.3% previously) Earnings: Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), AMD (AMD), Amgen (AMGN), Apollo (APO), Chipotle (CMG), Electronic Arts (EA), Enphase (ENPH), Estée Lauder (EL), Ferrari (RACE), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Merck (MRK), PayPal (PYPL), PepsiCo (PEP), Pfizer (PFE), Snap (SNAP), Spotify (SPOT) Wednesday Economic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ending Jan. 31 (-2% prior); ADP Private Payrolls, December (+153,000 expected, +111,000 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, January final (52.8 prior); S&P Global US composite PMI, January final (52.4 prior); ISM services index, January final (54.5 expected, 54.1 prior) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Thursday Economic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January (+11.4% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 1 (207,000 previously) Earnings: Amazon (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Affirm (AFRM), e.lf. Beauty (ELF), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), ConocoPhillips (COP), Hershey (HSY), Peloton (PTON), Pinterest (PINS), Phillip Morris International (PM), Roblox (RBLX), Tapestry (TPR), Yum! Brands (YUM) Friday Economic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, January (+150,000 expected, +256,000 previously); Unemployment rate, January (4.1% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, January (+3.8% expected, +3.9% previously); Average weekly hours worked, January (34.3 expected, 34.3 previously); Labor force participation rate, January (62.5% previously); Annual revisions to the employment establishment survey expected; University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, February preliminary (74 prior) Earnings: Canopy Growth (CGC), Newell Brands (NWL) Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Few signs have emerged since Donald Trump announced tariffs targeting America's largest trading partners that any force outside of the president himself will be able to reverse his decision. PepsiCo chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta looks to jumpstart growth in 2025. The president himself said there might be some pain. He has delivered it. U.S. job openings fell in December, a sign that the labor market is cooling but still healthy. Openings fell to 7.6 million, from 8.2 million in November, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The number of layoffs fell, suggesting that Americans enjoy unusual job security. TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. private equity firm KKR has sweetened its offer for Japan's Fuji Soft by 4%, the latest salvo in its protracted and messy bidding war with Bain Capital for the $4 billion IT firm. KKR raised its offer price to 9,850 yen ($63.44) per share from 9,451 yen per share, above Bain's most recent offer of 9,600 yen per share in December. Even after Fuji Soft's board rejected its bid, Bain perservered - a rare step in Japan - citing "strong concerns and distrust" over Fuji Soft's response and arguing the rejection harmed the interests of minority shareholders. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has gotten off to a bad start on the stock market in 2025, losing more than 10% of its value as of this writing, with Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's launch of a low-cost but capable AI model playing a key role in the semiconductor giant's troubles. Nvidia stock was one of the biggest victims of the sell-off, dropping 17% on Jan. 27 after it emerged that DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT's downloads on the Apple app store in the U.S. DeepSeek's low-cost model sparked concerns about major cloud computing companies and governments reducing their demand for the AI chips Nvidia sells. Prices of cocoa — a key ingredient in chocolate — have increased relentlessly over the past year, forcing companies such as Mondelez to hike prices of their products. Chicago-based Mondelez expects its 2025 profit to fall 10% on an adjusted basis, compared with analysts' average estimate of a 6.7% decline, according to data compiled by LSEG. Mondelez's volumes in Europe, its largest market by revenue, fell in the fourth quarter on account of incremental price hikes. INCY's fourth-quarter 2024 earnings are likely to have gained from higher Jakafi and Opzelura sales. Trump's plan might be "to acquire Bitcoin without the bureaucracy," Austin King tells TheStreet Crypto. Nike (NYSE: NKE) has been a top stock to own throughout its history.

Given these dynamics and the volatility in the stock market, it could be difficult for investors to pick the right stocks for their portfolios. Tracking the recommendations of top analysts could be helpful in this regard, as they look beyond short-term noise and focus on companies' long-term growth potential. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start with streaming giant Netflix (NFLX). The company recently impressed investors with better-than-anticipated results for the fourth quarter of 2024, reporting about 19 million subscriber additions. Reacting to the stellar Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on NFLX stock and boosted the price target to $1,150 from $1,000, saying "NFLX enters the new year firing on all cylinders." Anmuth added that Netflix is gaining from a very solid content slate. While the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight, the Christmas Day NFL games and the second season of "Squid Game" were major content releases in Q4, the analyst noted the company's commentary that these three together accounted for only a small percentage of the overall subscriber additions and that the robust additions were driven by broad content strength. The analyst also highlighted that Netflix is witnessing enhanced engagement per member household and encouraging retention. Reacting to the company's decision to raise prices, Anmuth expects only a little pushback in the U.S. and a few other markets, given the strong content. Looking ahead, the analyst believes that the story this year will shift more towards advertising, with the company gearing up to pursue several initiatives. Overall, Anmuth is bullish on Netflix based on double-digit revenue growth estimates for 2025 and 2026, operating margin expansion, its dominant position in streaming, and expectations of a multi-year rise in free cash flow. He now expects 30 million net additions in 2025 compared to the previous estimate of 21 million. The analyst also increased his revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 4% and raised his operating profit estimate for both years by 13%. Anmuth ranks No. 80 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Netflix Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. This week's second stock pick is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a pioneer in robotic-assisted surgery and the maker of the popular da Vinci surgical systems. The company ended 2024 on a strong note, with market-beating earnings. However, ISRG's gross margin guidance for 2025 fell short of expectations and indicated contraction compared to 2024. In reaction to the results, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus reaffirmed a buy rating on ISRG stock and increased the price target to $675 from $575. The analyst noted the company's upbeat profitability metrics and explained that the revenue beat was driven by solid gross system placements and procedure growth. In particular, Marcus noted the placement of 174 da Vinci 5 systems in Q4 2024, way ahead of JPMorgan's estimate of 125. "With strong momentum from dv5 heading into 2025 and a setup for another year of beat-and-raise quarters, we remain bullish on Intuitive and reiterate our Top Large Cap Pick," he said. Commenting on the 2025 outlook, Marcus stated that Intuitive Surgical's gross margin guidance of 67% to 68% slightly lagged JPMorgan's and the Street's estimate of about 68.5%. However, the analyst contended that while the gross margin guidance miss triggered some concerns, he sees the outlook as conservative, with a possible upside just as seen in 2024. He highlighted that ISRG's 2024 initial gross margin outlook was 67% to 68%, but it then ended the year favorably with a gross margin of nearly 69%. Overall, Marcus thinks that Intuitive Surgical is well positioned in the rapidly growing, underpenetrated soft-tissue robotics space. He expects the introduction of new systems and approval of the use of ISRG's systems in new procedures to drive future expansion. Marcus ranks No. 683 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.2%. See Intuitive Surgical Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at the cloud communications platform Twilio (TWLO). Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan upgraded TWLO stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $185 from $77 following the company's analyst day event and ahead of the fourth-quarter results in February. "Following multiple years of growth compression and several strategic actions, we believe Twilio is now hitting an inflection point both in terms of narrative and fundamentals," said Rangan, explaining the reason behind his rating upgrade. Further, Rangan expects solid free cash flow generation, supported by Twilio's aggressive cost reduction and efficiency measures. Rangan added that TWLO's analyst day reinforced his optimistic view, thanks to accelerated product velocity and an improved go-to-market strategy. The analyst thinks that enhancements to the company's Communications portfolio can help Twilio expand its already dominant position in the core CPaaS (communications platform as a Service) market. He thinks that following robust Q3 results, there is still notable upside in TWLO stock, driven by the company's strategic actions over the past two years. Also, Rangan sees a possible upside to the calendar year 2025 revenue growth estimates, given inflecting usage trends in communications and new product cross-sell opportunities, backed by core platform enhancements and generative AI innovations. Rangan ranks No. 345 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Twilio Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Title: DeepSeek Undermines Robust Earnings And Economic Growth

Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek ... [+] development and President Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) This week is the busiest of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 130 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Four of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with another two coming this week. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek development and President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. The S&P 500 fell 1% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 lost 0.8%. Market Returns Though DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence large language model was released in December 2024, it rattled the technology sector when it became the most downloaded application on the Apple store last week. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. While DeepSeek almost certainly spent more than disclosed and may have utilized others’ intellectual property, their artificial intelligence model seems to provide competitive performance at a lower development cost using less electricity and less powerful semiconductor chips. Because DeepSeek is a Chinese company, its LLM is not likely to be used directly by U.S. companies. Still, it is open-source, so others here will undoubtedly use its innovations to build their models quickly. Before DeepSeek, the development of artificial intelligence was an arms race, with the thought that massive spending on infrastructure, electricity, data, and bleeding-edge semiconductor chips was needed to compete. Nvidia (NVDA) was the most direct beneficiary of this environment, as the company is dominant in providing the most advanced AI chips. The innovations from DeepSeek have opened a new path for lower-cost AI models. While these models are less powerful, they could be offered to customers in a low or no-cost model. This has shifted the balance of market power between the developers and suppliers to large language models, and the companies are utilizing those models internally or offering them to consumers to favor the latter more than previously thought. The most striking example of this shift is the decline in Nvidia (NVDA) last week, while Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) rose. All is not likely lost for companies like Nvidia, however. There should still be robust demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips because the most advanced AI applications will still require that computing power. In addition, the lower the price of artificial intelligence services, the more demand there will be over time. The shift is a reminder of capitalism's creative destruction, especially regarding new technology. DeepSeek - Tech Sector Impact According to FactSet data, the communication services and technology sectors contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Meta Platforms (META) was the most significant contributor to communication services, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) being the most critical contributors to the technology sector. On the other side of the ledger, earnings misses by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) were the most significant detractors within industrials. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by technology and communications services. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-nine percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% has met expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for communication services and banks, the blended earnings performance improved last week and has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +13.2% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remain the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) reported last week, with all but Tesla besting consensus estimates. Market reaction was more mixed as Microsoft’s cloud earnings growth was disappointing, and the promise of Tesla robotaxis helped cushion the missed earnings. In addition, the DeepSeek introduction added to the difficulty in attributing this week’s price performance to earnings. This week, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) report after the close on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. The forward earnings guidance and implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. Beyond the Magnificent 7, other notable companies reporting are Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), PepsiCo (PEP), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Walt Disney (DIS), and Eli Lilly (LLY). Magnificent 7: Earnings Growth Last week, headline economic growth was reported at a below-consensus 2.3% in the fourth quarter, but the details painted a prettier picture of the economic situation. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes government spending, exports, and any change in inventories, grew by 3.2%, which is evidence that spending by households and businesses remained robust in the quarter. GDP: U.S. Economic Growth As widely expected, the Federal Reserve did not change short-term interest rates. Due to good economic momentum and above-target inflation, the Fed is not expected to alter monetary policy until mid-year. Currently, expectations are for a total of two 0.25% reductions in 2025. The monthly jobs report on Friday will be closely watched as jobs are the canary in the coal mine for economic growth. Struggling economic growth outside the U.S. and the possible impacts of tariffs adds further uncertainty to any outlook. Expected Fed Rate Cuts The earnings from technology and communication services didn’t disappoint, but the story was upended by the DeepSeek news. Two more Magnificent 7 companies, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), report earnings this week, and their earnings and forward guidance will be crucial. DeepSeek shows that the end of the artificial intelligence story has not yet been written so that investors will monitor the situation closely. In addition to being the busiest week of the earnings season, the tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with Friday’s monthly jobs report, could add to the market volatility.

Title: 'Tyranny of high expectations': A veteran investment chief explains why he's quietly cutting exposure to US stocks, even though he's optimistic about the economy and AI

Many of the market's biggest fears may be overblown, though the head of global multi-asset at T. Rowe Price is starting to scale out of US stocks anyway. Investment chief Sébastien Page recently told Business Insider that he's not worried about economic growth, even though fourth-quarter GDP just came in lighter than expected. GDP still more than doubled consensus estimates in 2024, he noted. Corporate earnings, spending, and the unemployment rate also look healthy, and that's before tax cuts and deregulation. It's also too soon to say that China-based DeepSeek's highly effective chatbot will send artificial intelligence spending spiraling, Page said. After speaking with T. Rowe Price's tech analysts, the 25-year market veteran concluded there's no need to panic about DeepSeek. "The economy looks fine, earnings are looking to grow at 15%, and you still have a lot of AI spending that's actually going to increase maybe by 20%, based on our analyst estimates," Page said in an interview. However, Page also said US equities don't look as attractive after a massive multi-year rally. His main concern is the same as it was last fall: Markets are already pricing in plenty of good news. The S&P 500's forward earnings ratio is in the 95th to 98th percentile historically, he noted, but it pales in comparison to that of mega-cap growth stocks. This group's valuations are even more stretched now than they were in mid-November, following the postelection market surge. Even if all goes well with the economy, which Page sees as likely but far from certain, US stocks could fall short of lofty expectations if investors are underwhelmed by earnings. That's why as markets march ever-higher, Page said he's increasingly inclined to take money off the table. "We're still overweight stocks, but we're starting to reduce that overweight," Page said. "We're determining our risk-on positioning. I think as markets continue to rally, we'll continue to fade our overweight to go back to neutral-weight — not get out of stocks completely, just get back to neutral-weight. So that's how we're playing this right now." It's hard to poke a hole in fourth-quarter earnings results, at least so far. Profits have exceeded estimates and are up about 10% so far, according to Bank of America. Big-tech earnings were more of a mixed bag, as Meta pleased investors while Microsoft and Apple had some red flags. While some companies have issued timid forward guidance, the Street thinks earnings will rise at a mid-teen rate in 2025. If analysts are right, stocks could be in for another strong year. "The forecast for the next 12 months is that earnings are going to grow at 15% — that's a high bar," Page said. "So if you want to be an optimist, we can say, 'Look, we don't even need P/E expansion; we don't even need valuations to go higher. If just earnings come through, we can get double-digit stock returns.'" But companies have almost no room for error, Page said, considering where valuations are in the face of interest rates that are now expected to stay at restrictive levels for a longer time. So unless quarterly results meet or exceed an exceedingly high bar, US stocks could take a big hit. "I call it the 'tyranny of high expectations,'" Page said. "Meaning, the expectations for earnings growth are so high that you set yourself up for missing the mark." Cheaper value stocks are among the safest places to be in this expensive market, Page said. The market has fallen by 1% or more 17 times in the last 200 trading sessions, Page noted. In each of those instances, stocks with a value tilt have outperformed their growth-oriented peers, he said. That means value stocks are a better bet during selloffs, and have rebound potential. "Projecting forward 12 months, I would ascribe at least as much upside in value as in growth, given the valuation differential and the broadening fundamentals," Page said. "So to be overweight value I think is an interesting less-downside/same-upside kind of trade." However, that's not to say that the investment chief is bearish on growth stocks. The AI trade isn't over, Page said, as cheaper, better AI can actually cause its adoption rate to accelerate. "I would own both growth and value; tech and non-tech," Page said. "I think we're probably approaching peak concentration. So in our portfolios, we have a slight overweight to value stocks. We think growth stocks are still a very good long-term investment." With that said, stocks in economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials, and materials are strong bets because their valuations are reasonable, and the gap between their earnings growth and those of tech firms is narrowing. The same is true of healthcare stocks, he noted. Outside of the US, investors should stay selective. Page isn't overly bullish on international stocks but said less-heralded markets like Japan, Argentina, and Brazil are worth a look. In short, Page said his best advice for the next 11 months is the same as it usually is. "I don't really like to say, 'Stay invested; stay diversified,' because it's sort of an answer you can give at any point in time," Page said. "If you think about that statement, you could put it on a fortune cookie." But in this richly valued and ever-shifting stock market, that truism rings especially true. "I expect markets to broaden, hence the 'stay diversified,' and I think the economy and earnings will do just fine, hence the 'stay invested,'" Page said. "So when someone asks you in an elevator, 'Hey, you're an investment person,' what should you say? Just say that. And it actually works quite well right now." Jump to

Title: Big Pharma has a big Super Bowl dilemma

Big Pharma often turns to NFL games to hawk their blockbuster treatments, but drug makers have typically been hesitant to advertise during the big game. This hesitation could mean pharmaceutical companies are missing out on a major opportunity to connect with viewers, according to a new analysis by the TV outcomes firm EDO. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.47%) alone aired a total of 16 commercials for its mega-popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during games in the 2024-2045 NFL regular season, resulting in nearly 283 million impressions, according to data from EDO. Pfizer (PFE-2.40%) ran 10 ads for its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, generating over 147 million impressions. Considering these numbers, you would think prescription drug companies would be jumping to air ads on what is typically the most-watched broadcast in America. Yet, there are a number of reasons drug companies have been reluctant to air ads during the Super Bowl. In addition to cost — a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has surged to $8 million, viewers generally expect commercials airing during the game to be entertaining and light-hearted. This can be a difficult balance for prescription drug ads to land when they are required to list off all their potential side effects. EDO head of client solutions Laura Grover said that the ads’ big price tag may also not be worth it for drugs that treat conditions with a small incidence rate — a measurement of new cases of a disease over time. “The Super Bowl is a great tool to reach a lot of people at the same time and you do pay a premium for that,” said Grover. “So, if you’re focused on a drug that has a very small incidence rate, it may not be the best investment.” Super Bowl ads can also elevate scrutiny of Big Pharma. In 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN+2.19%) and Daiichi Sankyo bought prominent ad space to market a drug to treat opioid-induced constipation. The White House and at least two police chiefs responded, saying the companies should’ve warned viewers about opioid addiction instead of constipation. Between 1999–2019, the CDC recorded half a million deaths in the U.S. linked to opioid overdoses. For drug makers attempting to cash in on the Super Bowl, the prime ad spot can have a big pay off, especially when it comes to viewer engagement with a brand. “The Super Bowl is a different type of viewing,” said Grover. “People are tuning in for the ads just as much as the game.” Only two prescription drug companies aired ads during last year’s Super Bowl festivities: Pfizer and Astellas, which aired an ad during the pre-game broadcast. Pfizer aired a 60-second spot that promoted the company’s scientific legacy. According to EDO, that ad resulted in one-and-a-half times as much engagement, compared with the median Super Bowl ad between 2020 and 2024. EDO measures engagement by analyzing metrics such as online search activity and website visits after the ad aired. “Because we’re focusing on live linear TV, we know exactly when an ad aired. — — like the actual second when it aired,” Grover explained. “And then we’re tying that to search data that is also down-to-the-second level.” For this year’s Super Bowl, at least two drug companies have already announced plans for commercials during the game. The millennial-targeting telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS-3.25%) is set to air its first-ever Super Bowl commercial advertising its lower-cost weight-loss treatments — including an off-brand version of Wegovy. Novartis (NVS-2.69%) is also airing its first Super Bowl ad. Their ad features actress Hailee Steinfeld and aims to raise awareness for breast cancer and the importance of cancer screenings. “If you have the right drug that has a broader appeal, these live events, NFL, and Super Bowl could be really strong environments for a pharma brand,” said Grover.

DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated. DEI is on its way out, but there is a fetid, hidden cavern where it still thrives unmolested: ESG. Among other things, ESG is a system that assesses and regulates a company's "sustainability", ethics and practices. The Environmental aspect of a company rates and evaluates their levels of pollution, energy and water usage, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions to discern the alleged impact on the environment. This assumes, of course, a deleterious effect on the environment, which cannot be proved. The planet has a way of cleaning itself up. It is within the Social aspect of ESG where the DEI may still hide. That area addresses the relationships between its employees and executives with DEI at the core. The Social aspects also include employee health and safety, customer satisfaction, and (take note) "community engagement", the latter being another way to inject DEI. You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated.

February 01, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
