UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by mid-2025 as part of a cost-saving strategy amid economic uncertainty and reduced Amazon deliveries. The company is shifting away from lower-margin Amazon shipments (12% of revenue) to focus on more profitable sectors like healthcare and international deliveries. UPS expects $3.5 billion in savings by 2025, aiming to boost operating margins despite economic pressures from tariffs and slowing trade demand. First-quarter revenue ($21.5B) beat expectations, but UPS declined to update its full-year outlook due to unpredictable market conditions. Most layoffs will impact non-union management as UPS restructures its workforce and network, attempting to emerge "stronger and more nimble."

Most layoffs will impact non-union management as UPS restructures its workforce and network, attempting to emerge "stronger and more nimble." In a significant restructuring move, UPS announced plans on Tuesday to eliminate 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by June 2025. This aggressive cost-cutting strategy is being driven by its decision to reduce deliveries for Amazon and navigate an uncertain economic landscape. The layoffs will impact just over 4% of UPS's 490,000-strong workforce and follow last year's cut of 12,000 positions. Strategic pivot from Amazon The job cuts come after UPS's January decision to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it handles. While Amazon deliveries constitute approximately 12% of UPS's revenue, the company determined that profit margins from these shipments were too small and is now refocusing on more lucrative markets such as healthcare and international deliveries. During UPS's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, CEO Carol TomÃ© explained the rationale: "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Amazon maintains that it has a "strong working relationship" with UPS. Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, noted that Amazon had actually "offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments." Nantel added, "Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision. We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers." Economic uncertainty and cost savings TomÃ© cited the uncertain economic environment as another factor in the company's restructuring: "The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years," she stated during Tuesday's earnings call. The company expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 through these cost-cutting measures. "These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability," CFO Brian Dykes explained during the earnings call. Economic headwinds include extensive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that have slowed trade and led companies to reduce costs in anticipation of reduced demand. For delivery companies like UPS, this slowdown likely means decreased demand for shipping services between businesses. UPS is keeping customers informed about tariff developments on its website and has introduced a tool called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs for duties, fees and taxes. Financial performance and outlook Despite these challenges, UPS reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday, with revenue of $21.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $21.05 billion. The company posted an adjusted profit per share of $1.49, ahead of analysts' expectations of $1.38. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," said CEO TomÃ©. However, UPS declined to provide any updates to its full-year outlook due to economic uncertainty. UPS had previously announced its expectation for 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Of UPS's 490,000 employees, around 330,000 are represented by the Teamsters union. The company is consolidating its facilities and workforce as it prepares for reduced Amazon shipments. UPS may identify additional buildings for closure as it continues to review its network. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS," TomÃ© stated. Last year, UPS delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year. Whether the company can maintain its dominance while shedding jobs and facilities remains to be seen.

Title: Gerry Thornley: all four Irish provinces beaten on same weekend for first time since March 2015

Time Published: 2025-04-29T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
All seems even less hunky dory underneath the surface after that weekend. For the first time since March 2015 all four Irish sides lost on the same weekend, on top of which the Ireland women’s team suffered their most sobering reality check of the campaign. That said, for those in Clontarf, Nenagh, Trinity, Dungannon, Skerries and Thomond it was the best weekend of the season. The last time all four Irish provinces lost on the same weekend was in the old Pro 12, when the quartet each suffered defeats to Welsh opposition. As then Leinster lost away to the Scarlets, while Munster, beaten in Cardiff on Friday night, lost to the Ospreys a decade ago. Connacht had a fall off in performance after their brave effort in defeat to the Stormers when losing to the Lions last Saturday, while Ulster were worn down by the Sharks’ superior physicality and depth on Saturday night. Leinster, of course, could afford just a second defeat of the season, especially as Glasgow were outmuscled at home by the Stormers on Friday night, so maintaining the eight-point gap at the top the table ahead of next Saturday’s Champions Cup showdown against a dangerous Northampton. Victory at home to Zebre a week later would ensure top seeding in the BKT URC playoffs ahead of their final game at home to Glasgow; additionally helpful if they have reached a fourth successive Champions Cup final a week later. By contrast Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all fallen outside the top eight, and there is a distinct likelihood that Ireland will only have two sides in next season’s Champions Cup for the first time ever, with the possibility that this may even be one side. That would be quite a fall. Munster and Ulster meet at Thomond Park next Friday week in what is now a dog-eat-dog scrap for playoff and Champions Cup qualification between two provinces who have been ever-presents in the 30 years of the latter competition. While Munster now sit ninth behind Benetton, with both on 41 points, by dint of winning less matches they have their destiny in their own hands as they also host the Italian outfit at Musgrave Park in the final round six nights later. By contrast an Ulster squad even more lacking in depth sit in 12th on 38 points, and so their need is the more acute in Thomond Park ahead of a trek to Edinburgh, who are 10th, on the ensuing Friday. Connacht’s chances of the top eight are more remote as they sit 14th on 35 points and must finish with wins at home to Edinburgh and away to Zebre if they are to have any chance of a top-eight place. Significantly, the Welsh quartet finish their campaigns with two games in South Africa. The fear always lurked that for all the huge improvement in the Ireland women’s team in the last 12 months some of it had to be attributed to the return of Olympian Sevens players who were unavailable in last season’s Six Nations, and that while they have become a good team they are not yet a good squad. In the absence of the hugely influential Sam Monaghan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer, that lack of depth was further exposed when losing Edel McMahon and Dorothy Wall in the first half of last Saturday’s loss to Scotland in Edinburgh. It’s still been a campaign of progress, with more competitive displays at home to England and France, as well as the high point of the win in Parma. But Saturday’s defeat is a setback psychologically, and certainly gives the first World Cup warm-up match against Scotland in Cork on August 2nd more significance. Either way while a World Cup semi-final is still a viable target, beating New Zealand again in the pool stages or overcoming France in the quarter-final looks a tall order, particularly after the stirring late comeback by Les Bleus in losing 43-42 in Saturday’s Grand Slam decider against England. Amid all this club rugby was seen at its best on the final weekend of the AIL as UL Bohs and Clontarf secured All-Ireland titles again at the Aviva Stadium. À la the Joey Carbery final when Clontarf beat Cork Constitution in 2016, last Sunday wasn’t quite the Hugh Cooney final, but it wasn’t far off it either. As a Clontarf centre who came through Blackrock, Cooney is not the first to plot such a journey, and while not wanting to saddle him unduly with comparisons to The Great One, with his leg power, explosiveness, pace and low centre of gravity the 21-year-old has similar attributes. Cooney and Hugh Gavin look like being the first of the new crop of young centres coming through to be capped this summer in Tbilisi or Georgia. Meanwhile Nenagh Ormond became the first Tipperary club to be promoted to Division 1A and Trinity preserved their 1B status with dramatic two-score comebacks at home to wilting UCC and Cashel sides. Dungannon won promotion to 1B by winning in Navan, Skerries stayed in 2B by beating Midleton at home, and Thomond reclaimed their AIL status by winning in Omagh in the only game that wasn’t a one-score affair. The league has found a niche. Ten-team divisions and playoffs ensure jeopardy and a dearth of dead rubbers until the very end. But having the finals a week after the semi-finals, which are just a fortnight after the three-game rush to the season’s final standings, is just too demanding a load for the mostly amateur and semi-pro players. The best final of recent times was two years ago, when Terenure beat Clontarf 50-24, which was a fortnight after the semi-finals. That’s the way it should be. The AIL finals could have been held next Sunday, on the May bank holiday weekend, which would also help rather than hinder clubs outside Dublin such as Cork Constitution in bringing members and fans to Dublin. It would also afford the IRFU, sponsors and finalists two weeks to promote the finals. The May bank holiday weekend should be enshrined in the club calendar as All-Ireland club rugby weekend. If occasionally this clashed with Leinster matches or the finals were lost to either TG4 or from the Aviva to somewhere else nor would that be the end of the world. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish drummer Kevin Brady: ‘Most nights you’re able to hear great live jazz. But we need something like classical has in the NCH’

There is a photograph of the quartet led by the Irish jazz drummer Kevin Brady that makes it look a little like a Scandi death-metal band. The American keyboardist Bill Carrothers – buzz-cut, beard and steely eye – is decked out in camouflaged military-style hunting jacket. The London-born, Vancouver-raised and Cologne-based saxophonist Seamus Blake, whose father was from Dublin, is peering out over lowered eyebrows with what comes across as a combination of scepticism and menace. Brady, who is dressed, like Blake, all in black, is solemn, glassy-eyed and half in deep shadow. The Irish bassist Dave Redmond, to the rear, looks, as Brady jokes to me, “like he urgently needs to be somewhere else”. In reality, the group, which works under the banner of the Kevin Brady Electric Quartet – in which Carrothers plays Fender Rhodes electric piano, Redmond switches to electric bass and Brady is increasingly integrating electronic drum percussion – is one of the most acclaimed and ambitious international jazz ensembles working in Ireland. Formed in 2019, the band combines a highly intuitive and interactive Irish rhythm section that has played together for 20 years or more with two of the most gifted and admired, if sometimes criminally undervalued, musicians in modern jazz. Carrothers, who is based in Michigan, has a long association with Redmond and Brady – as a piano trio they have released three highly rated studio albums, many featuring Carrothers’s winningly eclectic compositions – and he is renowned for his harmonic elegance, broad musical knowledge and many-sided virtuosity. Blake, a master tenor saxophonist, is a muscular and commanding soloist somewhat in the Michael Brecker and Chris Potter mode, yet with his own elastic sound, advanced sense of lyricism and endlessly inventive style. The overall result lands in several sweet spots between late-1960s Miles Davis and early-1970s Herbie Hancock: liquid electric postbop with catchy melodies, deep grooves, rhythmic ingenuity, consummate improvisation and a strikingly contemporary edge. While the group’s multinational nature and heavily in-demand members may make regular creative get-togethers something of a challenge, the Electric Quartet has released one celebrated album, Plan B – “timeless, joyous music that will further burnish the reputations of all concerned”, according to the Irish Times review. Next month the band embarks on one of its rare tours of Ireland, playing seven dates across the island. Brady is a highly respected musician and teacher. A fluid and versatile drummer with a great sense of swing, he can play anything from funk to free jazz, but he is primarily influenced by some of the pioneering American drummers of the 1950s and 1960s, including Tony Williams, Max Roach, Jimmy Cobb, Art Taylor and Elvin Jones – as well as the irresistible polyrhythms of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music. “In the 20 years I’ve been coming to Ireland, Kevin’s the best drummer I’ve heard,” Carrothers says. As a side musician and group anchor, Brady, who is 51, has become exceptionally popular with bands both in Ireland and abroad. At home he has been a crucial member of groups led by the guitarist Tommy Halferty, the pianist Phil Ware and the keyboardist Scott Flanigan, and by the saxophonists Richie Buckley and Meilana Gillard; in addition he has performed and recorded with Irish acts ranging from Van Morrison to the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Gráda to Dave Geraghty of Bell X1. [ Kevin Brady Electric Quartet: Plan B – an engrossing new musical directionOpens in new window ] Brady has also worked with the English jazz vocalists Norma Winstone and Ian Shaw, the American saxophonist and 1960s James Brown creative force Pee Wee Ellis, and the American guitarist and “godfather of fusion” Larry Coryell, among many others. “I try to bring an emotional response to any music I’m involved in, and an energy,” he says. “I want the music to be active.” He is also the composer of tight, melodically strong and rhythmically dynamic tunes that defy the lazy commonplace that drummers are there to keep time, not contribute original music. “The idea that if you play drums you’ve got no sense of cop-on with regard to knowing what a scale or a chord or a melody is … I think we’re way past that now,” he says. We meet in the recital room of Newpark Academy of Music, in Blackrock in south Dublin – “this room has been the venue for masterclasses by many great visiting jazz musicians, including the drummer Art Blakey,” he says – where Brady has been teaching drums for approaching 25 years; he is also head of the jazz programme at the school and lectures on the BA jazz degree course at Dublin City University. For participants who range from toddlers to final-year secondary students, Newpark is “the gold standard of musical education in Ireland”; founded in 1979, it is a registered charity with 42 staff and 600 students. Hozier is one of its alumni. Last year, at short notice, it was threatened with closure. Brady was one of the leaders of the campaign that saved the centre; from September the academy will transfer to new, though as yet unannounced, premises nearby. “I think people saw the importance of what’s been achieved here, both in the past and for the future,” Brady says. “If you start closing down music schools that have legacies like Newpark, then that’s not a world I would like to be living in.” Brady was born in Dublin. Neither of his parents was a musician, though his father sang in local musical societies, had a large vinyl collection and was a passionate fan of big-band jazz, as well as of the artistry of the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the singer Sarah Vaughan. He began private piano lessons at the age of six, progressing through to the highest grades; a couple of years later he began playing trumpet, and later cornet, in a local concert band that sometimes toured Europe. In his teenage years Brady began playing keyboards in local jam bands, moving to drums “purely by coincidence” when one drummer failed to show for a rehearsal. He began teaching himself, initially falling under the influence of Stewart Copeland, the multifaceted American drummer from The Police, and at 17 began lessons at Newpark with the drummer Conor Guilfoyle. “I remember Kevin being a really good student with a voracious appetite to learn; like he is now, he was a complete enthusiast,” Guilfoyle says. “He wasn’t playing jazz at this point, more funk and rock, but he had a really good time feel. And that’s essential. It means you can adapt to many different styles of music – and also that good musicians will always want to play with you.” Increasingly drawn towards jazz – one of the earliest sparks was the present his father gave him for Christmas when he was 13: Wynton Marsalis’s Marsalis Standard Time, Vol 1 – he gave up a place studying classical music at University College Dublin in favour of a life practising, taking private lessons and playing blues and rock gigs. When he was 22, on Guilfoyle’s advice, he studied for six months at the prestigious Drummers Collective in New York; shortly after he took the year-long newly formed professional musician training course at Newpark set up by Ronan and Conor Guilfoyle. He has never looked back. Since then, over the past quarter-century or more, he has led an exemplary jazz life in Ireland, albeit one that has not exactly made him wealthy. He has admirably sought to advance his skills by studying with drummers and percussionists in the United States, Cuba and Brazil. And, from his early 30s, he has led bands and developed a reputation for being enterprising and hardworking, for being the kind of musician who consistently makes things happen. “His determination and discipline towards grant writing and procuring gigs is pretty legendary. He’s a dog on a bone,” Carrothers says. As a linchpin of the domestic music scene, Brady is also extremely well placed to gauge the state of jazz in Ireland. “I think it’s pretty healthy,” he says, quick as a flash. “Most nights, in Dublin at least, you’re going to be able to hear great live jazz featuring both established and younger musicians. “But one thing we’re lacking as a major capital in Europe is a government-backed centre for jazz and improvised music,” he adds. “Somewhere with a 300- to 400-seat venue, education and outreach programmes, resources, an archive, all sorts of stuff that would promote and preserve the music. Something like classical music has in the National Concert Hall and trad has with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. [ Newpark Academy of Music saved from closure through licence reprieveOpens in new window ] “I know the audience is there, 100 per cent. As is the interest in jazz; I can see it in my students. But we need to follow through and take the initiative, take the next step. A dedicated venue would be a massive bonus not just for jazz in Ireland but for the whole country.” The Kevin Brady Electric Quartet plays the Yeats Building, Sligo, on Sunday, May 4th; Magy’s Farm, Dromara, Co Down, on Monday, May 5th; Riverbank Arts Centre, Newbridge, Co Kildare, on Wednesday, May 7th; Solstice Arts Centre, Navan, on Thursday, May 8th; Wexford Arts Centre on Friday, May 9th; Arthur’s Blues & Jazz Club, Dublin, on Saturday, May 10th; and Triskel Christchurch, Cork, on Friday, May 16th. The Kevin Brady Trio with Bill Carrothers and Dave Redmond plays Bray International Jazz Festival on Friday, May 2nd, and City of Derry Jazz Festival on Saturday, May 3rd © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

CNN panelists were unimpressed by Sen. Chuck Schumer touting a "very strong letter" he wrote to President Trump over his attacks on Harvard University. Charlamagne tha God called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for hypocrisy over their sudden concern about big money in politics. "I think it's ridiculous even when they try to say things, you know, all these conversations about oligarchy, oligarchy, oligarchy," Charlamagne said on "The Breakfast Club" Monday. "Now Bernie [Sanders] and AOC, they can go out there and say, ‘Fight the oligarchy.’ Hakeem Jeffries, you can't say that, okay, like, cut it out, we know that you've taken so much money from corporate donors." "So, it's just weird to see them, you know, push back against oligarchy now and say, 'Look at the billionaires controlling Trump.' It's like, really? You, Hakeem, really? Chuck Schumer, really?" Charlamagne added. According to OpenSecrets.org, some of Schumer’s biggest donations come from corporations, including Blackstone Group, Nextera Energy, Newmark Group, and L3Harris Technologies. SCHUMER REFUSES TO RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT: ‘TRUMP IS VIOLATING RULE OF LAW IN EVERY WAY’ Charlamagne tha God is schooling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries over what he calls their sudden apportion to big money in politics. (Getty Images) Previous reporting from Fox News Digital found that Democracy PAC II, tied to George Soros, gave $2.5 million to Schumer’s Senate Majority PAC in 2024. Democracy PAC II also gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a total of $6 million. Jeffries’ profile on OpenSecrets.org is similar, with some of his largest donations coming from BlackRock Inc and Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, in February, Politico reported that Jeffries met privately with major donors in Silicon Valley. "I know there are some people that think Joe Biden should help rebuild because, as the most recent president, he is the de facto leader of the party. And to those people, I’d like to say: Hunter, lay off the crack," Charlamagne joked. "So who’s supposed to be the leaders? Well, in Congress, you’ve got two people. The first one is this guy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries." He then showed a video of Jeffries wearing a suit with no tie and sunglasses outside the U.S. Capitol Building, talking about democracy. Charlamagne then called Schumer "Payless Obama’s counterpart in the Senate," and said that he was "even less inspiring." Charlamagne has been critical of the two Congressional Democrat minority leaders before, recently mocking them as party leaders and saying they should be "thrown out of office."

Cory Booker, D-N.J., held a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's budget bill and cuts they claim will be made to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Fox News Digital reached out to Schumer and Jeffries for comment, but did not immediately receive a response. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rachel del Guidice is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

April 28, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: August 8, 2023 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Man (66) who died while cycling was ‘meticulous’ in wearing safety equipment, inquest hears

A 66-year-old man who was “meticulous” in wearing safety equipment when cycling died from a severe brain injury after falling from his bike, an inquest has heard. A sitting of Dublin District Coroner’s Court heard that Conor Kenny, the head of a consultancy firm and author of several business books, died hours after setting off for a cycle to Ticknock woods in south Dublin. Judith Kenny said her husband, who was a regular runner and cyclist, was “meticulous” about safety equipment, which he was wearing when he left for his cycle on August 4th, 2024. She recalled ringing her husband several times after hearing “concerning” sirens near their home in Ballinteer in the hours after he left. Neville O’Connor, who was hiking on the day of Mr Kenny’s death, recalled seeing a cyclist pass him at a “fairly good speed” shortly before 1.30pm. After Mr Kenny rounded a bend ahead and was out of sight, Mr O’Connor heard a “very loud bang like a bike hitting the ground”. He said there were no cars in the area at the time. He ran to Mr Kenny who was still wearing his helmet, lying on the ground close to his bike and struggling to breathe. Mr O’Connor said he administered CPR until paramedics arrived and transferred him to St Vincent’s University Hospital. Dr Patrick Hillery, a consultant in emergency medicine, said Mr Kenny arrived in cardiac arrest. After all possible avenues were exhausted, he was pronounced deceased some 35 minutes later, the doctor said. He noted a significant volume of blood in Mr Kenny’s mouth “which would be consistent with an unprotected fall”. He believed Mr Kenny may have suffered a cardiac arrest before the fall. Garda Jason McDonnell, a member of the roads policing unit at Blackrock Garda station, said Mr Kenny’s smartwatch recorded a “sharp and sudden” drop in speed from 13.06 metres per second (47km/h) to 0 metres per second at 1.28pm. Garda McDonnell said the brakes and tyres of Mr Kenny’s bike were in good working order, and the site of the crash “wouldn’t be an area where you would have road traffic collisions”. A postmortem recorded the medical cause of death as severe craniocerebral trauma and noted a finding of amyloid angiopathy, a condition that causes bleeding into the brain, which could have caused a spontaneous bleed before his crash. Coroner Dr Clare Keane returned a narrative verdict, saying: “We are clear there was a fall from the bicycle, what we cannot conclude with certainty is whether the bleeding resulted from the fall or possibly precipitated it.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Writer announces Palmyra X5 LLM with 1M token context window to power AI agents

Time Published: 2025-04-28T19:00:36Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 15:00 EDT / APRIL 28 2025 by Kyt Dotson Generative artificial intelligence startup Writer Inc. today released its newest state-of-the-art enterprise-focused large language model Palmyra X5, an adaptive reasoning model that features a 1 million-token context window. The company also said that it teamed up with Amazon Web Services Inc. to announce the availability of the new model on Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed service for building AI applications by providing access to LLMs and machine learning models. In an interview with SiliconANGLE, Matan-Paul Shetrit, director of product management at Writer, said Palmyra X5 was trained entirely using synthetic data and required just $1 million in graphics processing unit hours. “Writer has been a leader from very early on in the use of synthetic data, as well as techniques that allow us to cut down costs, like stopping training if we don’t see returns, which lets us push model pricing way down,” Shetrit said. With its 1 million-token large-context window, the model can ingest and comprehend extensive codebases or large numbers of documents simultaneously. It also enables multistep reasoning across actions, making it ideal for powering agentic AI workflows. “Palmyra X5 is the newest model that comes with a 1 million-token context window, which is one of the largest commercially available, and it’s amongst the fastest and cheapest large-context LLMs,” Shetrit said. “This is critical when it comes to building multi-agentic systems, where the responses need to be continuously fed back into the context window across multistep workflows.” Shetrit said that going forward, Writer will incorporate the 1 million-token context window into all of Writer’s Palmyra family of models. The model can read an entire 1 million-token prompt in about 22 seconds, and it can return individual function-calling turns in about 300 milliseconds. X5 performs with a pricing of 60 cents per 1 million input tokens and $6 per 1 million output tokens. Between the low latency and low cost, it permits the model to provide high-speed performance across long contexts while allowing enterprise users to perform numerous actions without costing too much. This is essential, especially for agentic workflows, which can quickly become costly and slow with multistep and multiturn AI generations. “If you’re thinking about enterprise use cases, they’re extremely complex and interacting with multiple third-party, external or internal systems, often in multistep flows,” Shetrit said. “Our focus isn’t on solving for one- or two-agent workflows. It’s on enabling enterprises to manage 10, 50, or even 100,000 agents all working alongside employees to drive real transformational change.” The release of Palmyra X5 follows Writer’s launch of AI HQ, a new centralized hub for teams to easily build, deploy and orchestrate AI agents. Shetrit described Palmyra X5 and the company’s family of other Palmyra models as powerful “brains” for agents. He said X5 delivers on the company’s vision for helping companies adapt to the agentic AI trend. “Palmyra represents a critical step forward for companies seeking to embed generative AI into their enterprise workflows,” said David Cushman, executive research leader at HFS Research Ltd. “Palmyra is purpose-built for agent development, API function calling, multimodal processing and custom enterprise AI applications. More importantly, it’s integrated into Writer’s end-to-end platform that balances scalability with transparency — a core demand from regulators and stakeholders alike.” Hundreds of enterprise companies already use Writer’s Palmyra family of LLMs internally and externally to power their AI capabilities, including Accenture Plc, Marriott International Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Salesforce Inc. and The Vanguard Group Inc.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN analysis Topic:Tariffs While Donald Trump focuses on trade deficits with other nations, the US budget deficit continues to grow. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) The turmoil on global markets has taken a breather ever since US President Donald Trump backed away from his grand plan to impose tariffs on almost every other country. Stock markets have recovered almost all the ground they lost in the aftermath of the Liberation Day chaos and even bond markets have scaled back the panic, with yields continuing to edge lower. But the turmoil is likely to resume soon. Consumers globally have scaled back spending, corporations are calibrating the extent to which earnings expectations need to be lowered, American retailers are bracing for shortages and economists now are tipping much lower global growth and the possibility of a US recession. That's because Mr Trump's main target, China, is still facing a broad-based tariff of 145 per cent, which effectively is a ban on Chinese imports. On-again-off-again tariffs and an intensifying trade war with China are taking their toll on ordinary Americans. Even if the China tariffs are halved, that would massively increase US costs and slow output across the globe. And, for what? The White House is convinced that America is a victim of half a century of unfair trade policies that have forced the American people to buy necessities from elsewhere and weakened its global position. According to the president: "It's not just China, the European Union, they ripped us off for many, many years and those days are over," he repeated over the weekend at a doorstop interview. So, is America being ripped off? And will tariffs fix the "problem"? Financial markets have recovered ground since the initial tariff shock and turbulence, but America's economic woes are far from settled. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) In Donald Trump's world, deficits are always bad and surpluses are always good. In isolation, it's an easy concept to sell to a deeply divided nation. You can point to a problem and then apportion blame. But it ignores the fact that the US economy has powered its way to global domination during this period. So, it can't be all bad. Most economists dismiss the idea that a trade deficit, even an ongoing one, is bad. America's trade deficit occurs for the simple reason that Americans have a lot of money to spend and they buy more from offshore than they sell to foreigners. No-one is forcing them to buy the stuff. It's not the fault of China, or that of Mexico or Canada for that matter. Wondering how Trump's new tariffs were calculated? It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. Last year, America exported $US4.8 trillion ($7.5 trillion) worth of goods and services and imported $US5.9 trillion in goods and services. That left a $US1 trillion gap, or deficit, which it financed by borrowing. Mostly, it is big corporations buying either finished goods to sell to US citizens or components they need to manufacture goods in the US. It isn't foreign governments behind a grand conspiracy to "rip off" Uncle Sam. It's American companies choosing to buy in goods from offshore. As economist Jeffrey Sachs notes: "Suppose that you go on a shopping binge, spending more than your earnings by running up credit-card debt. It's also worth noting that it is not all gimmicks and gadgets coming across the border. Often, it is high-end equipment needed for industry and specialist services. Put another way, America invests more money than it saves. Tariffs build a wall around your economy. Those walls protect local industry from outside competition and allow industries and firms that ordinarily wouldn't be able to compete to survive. The offset, however, is that consumers have to pay more. Importers pay the tariff and then pass on those higher costs to customers. Many products US shoppers buy are imported from China and now face steep tariffs. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Many Americans faced with the prospect of paying far more for imported goods may then switch back to locally-produced goods. But they would be buying items that they previously decided they couldn't afford. That means consumers will have less money to spend on other things and US economic growth is likely to slow. And the price hikes on imported goods means inflation will rise. Another downside is that businesses become accustomed to the protection and, with less competition, don't innovate, so falling behind the rest of the world. From toy brands to fashion labels, some Australian firms are facing tariffs way above the 10 per cent "baseline". There are other issues as well. As we saw in recent weeks, as soon as the US announced the tariffs, those on the receiving end retaliated. That makes it harder for US suppliers to sell into foreign markets. So, while American firms may end up selling more product to Americans, their offshore sales are likely to slump. Any benefit they may have received from being protected at home will be eliminated by penalties in their export markets. This Boeing jet landed back in Seattle, Washington after being returned by a Chinese airline last week. (Reuters: David Ryder) The same goes for foreign firms — offshore sales will fall, which means global growth, not just America's, will slow. While the president bangs on about goods, he rarely mentions services. America exports a large amount of services to the rest of the world. In this area, it racks up a surplus. We're talking about things like education, tourism, software and information services. While the surplus is not enough to overcome the deficit in tradeable goods, the recent tariff hits have enraged other countries and seen a marked drop in foreign students wanting to enter the US, as well as an international backlash from tourists. As a result, the US trade deficit is likely to deteriorate as a result of the tariffs. America doesn't just run a trade deficit. It also runs a massive internal or budget deficit — and that is a far bigger problem. Years of handing out tax cuts to the extremely rich and vast overspending on defence has seen ongoing US budget deficits. You need to borrow to finance that, so the national debt has blown out to 122 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Tesla boss Elon Musk will cut back on his commitment to the Trump administration's DOGE and recommit to the carmaker, in a move cheered by investors after what analysts have called a "disaster" result. Those deficits continue to grow — during Trump's first term, he added $US8 trillion to the now bulging $US36.2 trillion in national debt, mostly through tax cuts. Joe Biden added a similar amount with his Inflation Reduction Act. America now spends more on servicing that debt each year than it spends on defence and the interest bill is the second biggest expense after social security. The White House often incorrectly mentions the national debt as being caused by the trade deficit which it then uses to justify tariffs. But if the tariffs cause GDP growth to slide or, worse, turn negative, then that debt situation could suddenly turn toxic. That's now becoming a real threat as large numbers of economists tip a US recession this year. Even worse, if the tariffs add to inflation and cause higher interest rates, servicing the debt will cost even more and the American economy could end up in serious trouble. America's financial stability has already been called into question by global investors. In the past month, they not only dumped Wall Street stocks, they abandoned US government bonds and the US dollar as well, a previously unimaginable set of events. While the Trump administration has taken aim at the US budget, hacking away at essential government services, it is looking at another massive tax cut for the wealthy which could further undermine the national finances. Globalisation was supposed to usher in a new era of wealth for the planet. Poorer countries would advance into the upper ranks more quickly and developed countries would reap the benefits. Many of those things came to pass, at least on paper. The problem was that the riches weren't doled out fairly. And the US was among the worst in shuffling the benefits through to the uber-rich. Wealth inequality blew out during the past half century. America may be rich on paper but the gap between the haves and the have-nots has widened into a yawning chasm. Mortality rates have risen, life expectancy has dropped, crime and incarceration levels have soared. The chaotic and hasty introduction of protectionism won't solve those problems. It could make them worse.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 28, 2025 14:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP APP Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm Before May 5th Deadline SAN FRANCISCO, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: How Stablecoins And Tokenization Are Rebuilding Global Finance

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Stablecoins and tokenization take center stage. (Photo by May James/SOPA Images/LightRocket via ... More Getty Images) Late last year, I stood on stage at a fintech summit in Singapore talking about digital identity, stablecoins and tokenization, surrounded by leaders from central banks, blockchain startups, and AI innovators. It was one of those moments where you could feel history nudging forward. Discussions that used to live in niche corners of crypto Twitter were now center stage — about programmable money, the fragility of global currencies, and the reinvention of financial infrastructure. There was an electricity in the air, not of fear, but of change. What struck me most was the shared understanding across sectors: the old financial rails weren’t just aging. They were being replaced, reimagined, and rebuilt. Later in 2025, at a Digital Economist event with financial researcher Tarun Kishnani, we dug deeper into what’s really happening underneath the surface. This isn’t about headlines or hype. It’s about a fundamental rewiring of the architecture that underpins global commerce and power. Much of this transformation can be traced back to an imbalance that has been growing for decades. Over reliance on foreign manufacturing, ballooning trade deficits, and geopolitical tensions have chipped away at the U.S.’s unchallenged monetary position. In just the past few months, the Dollar has weakened more than 10% against a basket of global currencies — not because people stopped believing in the U.S. entirely, but because uncertainty is being priced in at the margins. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, warned that adversaries are actively working to dismantle the Dollar’s hegemonic role. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said what once would have been controversial: that U.S. debt mismanagement could erode the Dollar’s reserve status. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) The U.S. has long preserved Dollar dominance by keeping global demand high — from oil pricing to trade settlement systems. But the new levers of power are digital, decentralized, and dynamic. One of the clearest signals that global finance is evolving is the astonishing rise of stablecoins. In 2024 alone, stablecoins processed over $27 trillion in volume — more than Visa and Mastercard combined. Stablecoins are a category of digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset, most commonly the U.S. Dollar. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly in value, stablecoins aim to offer the speed, transparency, and programmability of blockchain technology without the volatility. They are backed either by fiat currency reserves, commodities, or algorithmic mechanisms that manage supply and demand. Today, stablecoins like USDC and USDT serve as vital tools for global payments, trading, savings, and cross-border transactions — blending the trust of traditional finance with the efficiency of decentralized systems. Why are stablecoins growing so fast? They solve real-world problems. They offer instantaneous, low-cost transfers. They are transparent, programmable, and — in most cases — backed by U.S. Dollars. In a world increasingly skeptical of traditional intermediaries, stablecoins offer direct access to a stable financial anchor. As Tarun put it during our conversation, “Every time someone in Latin America or Southeast Asia loads USDC into a wallet, they’re extending the reach of the U.S. Dollar — without a single bank branch or military base.” Financial researcher Tarun Kishnani Stablecoins have become a new kind of financial infrastructure — invisible, efficient, and profoundly influential. While the surface of finance looks much the same — banks, apps, payments — the underlying rails are being transformed. SWIFT’s ISO 20022 upgrade is modernizing cross-border messaging to support tokenized assets. China’s CIPS network is providing an alternative to SWIFT for emerging markets. Meanwhile, blockchain-based settlement layers like Ethereum are allowing assets to move at internet speed, without traditional banking bottlenecks. This evolution isn’t a tech experiment anymore. It’s a full-scale reengineering of how value moves around the world. It's laying the groundwork for a future where money flows like information — fast, borderless, and programmable. Many assume decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) are locked in a zero-sum battle. But what’s actually emerging is a collaboration. Banks are experimenting with blockchain rails to streamline settlement and custody. DeFi platforms are embedding compliance features to attract regulated capital. The two systems are beginning to meet in the middle — with stablecoins acting as the connective tissue. Rather than disrupting for disruption's sake, this hybrid model is focused on resilience, innovation, and access. It’s not about breaking finance. It’s about upgrading it. Tokenization — the conversion of real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens — is moving from pilot projects into real deployment. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, put it succinctly: “Tokenization brings Wall Street efficiency to Main Street access.” Already, we’re seeing tokenized U.S. Treasuries gaining traction among global institutions looking for dollar exposure without the friction of traditional custody. Real estate platforms are tokenizing properties, allowing fractional ownership that enables more diverse participation. Corporates are beginning to tokenize debt instruments to reduce settlement times and financing costs. The potential is staggering: 24/7 markets, instant settlement, broader participation, and increased liquidity. And most of these assets are priced in Dollars — reinforcing the very monetary system many predicted would wane. Beyond the technical benefits, this new financial infrastructure could redefine access to opportunity. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized this broader mission: “This is our opportunity to build financial systems that don’t just work better—but work for more people.” Stablecoins and tokenized assets open doors for billions of people left behind by traditional banking. A farmer in Kenya can save in a stable currency. A startup founder in Vietnam can raise global capital. A student in Argentina can invest in tokenized U.S. equities. The goal isn’t just efficiency. It’s equity. It’s about creating systems that are open by design, not as an afterthought. Of course, this future is not without its challenges. Digital identity remains a crucial missing piece — without verifiable, portable identity, trust in ownership breaks down. Regulatory clarity is lagging behind technological innovation, leading to uncertainty for businesses and users alike. Technical risks — from smart contract vulnerabilities to blockchain outages — are real and must be managed with rigor. Moreover, the U.S.’s fiscal and political stability will continue to underpin Dollar confidence. Digital diplomacy through stablecoins is powerful, but it still rests on trust in the core institutions behind them. As you navigate this financial transformation with Stablecoins and Tokenization, the takeaway is clear: participation is no longer optional. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, an investor, a policymaker, or simply someone managing personal finances, understanding how stablecoins, tokenized assets, and digital infrastructure work will soon be as fundamental as understanding credit cards or online banking. If you’re a business leader, now is the time to modernize infrastructure and explore how digital assets could streamline operations, reduce costs, and open new markets. If you’re an investor, learning how tokenization is reshaping access to real estate, bonds, and global equities could uncover new opportunities for diversification and growth. And if you’re a policymaker, the moment demands thoughtful regulation that encourages innovation while protecting stability and inclusion. For individuals, the implications are profound. Financial systems are opening in ways that will create more access, more ownership, and more agency for people worldwide — but only for those who engage early. Saving, investing, and transacting with digital tools will move from experimental to expected. The rails are being rebuilt around you. The next chapter of finance will be more borderless, transparent, and participatory than any that came before. The best time to start understanding this shift was yesterday. The second-best time is today. What do you think about Stablecoins and Tokenization?

Title: Watch These Meta Stock Price Levels Ahead of Facebook Parent's Earnings

Time Published: 2025-04-28T17:59:53Z

Meta (META) shares were holding steady Monday as the Facebook and Instagram parent prepares to report first-quarter results after Wednesday’s closing bell. Investors will be paying close attention to the social media giant's ad revenue outlook, amid concerns of a broader slowdown in digital advertising spending by Chinese companies as the U.S. and China impose lofty tariffs on one another. Legal and regulatory disputes have nagged Meta, with the E.U. recently fining the tech giant for violating its Digital Markets Act and an antitrust trial getting underway in the U.S. Coming into the week, Meta shares were down about 7% for so far in 2025, though they have outperformed their Magnificent Seven peers over the period, boosted by the company’s significant investment in AI driving advertising growth and user engagement across its suite of apps. The stock was down fractionally at around $547 in mid-afternoon trading Monday. Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors may be eyeing. Meta shares have forged two closely aligned troughs during April, potentially setting the stage for a double bottom, a chart pattern that indicates a bullish reversal. More recently, the stock has undergone a pre-earnings bounce, with the price forming a doji in Friday’s trading session to signal indecision among buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) points to neutral conditions, providing a reading around the 50 threshold. Let’s identify several important support and resistance levels on Meta's chart. Investors should initially keep track of the $482 level. A pullback to this area would likely attract buying interest near the prominent April troughs that form the potential double bottom pattern. It’s worth pointing out that this location also sits in the same neighborhood as the 38.2% Fibonacci retirement level when applying a grid from the February high to April low. Selling below this key level could see the shares retreat to around $452. This area may provide support near swing lows that developed on retracements toward the 200-day moving average in July and August last year. A pre-earnings bump could trigger buying to the $588 level. Investors may view this area as a high probability location to lock in profits near a trendline that links the early-April countertrend rally with a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to December last year. Finally, a close above this level would confirm the double bottom pattern and potentially spark a move up to $632. Meta shares may run into overhead selling pressure in this region near multiple peaks that formed on the chart between December and March.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares led losses on the Dow and S&P 500 Monday afternoon following a report China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test a rival artificial intelligence chip. According to The Wall Street Journal, Huawei "is gearing up to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, which the company hopes could replace some higher-end products" from Nvidia. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that "Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D." Shares of Nvidia, which declined to comment on the report, were down close to 4% in recent trading. They've lost a fifth of their value since the start of the year, and have yet to fully recover from their plunge on Jan. 27 that wiped nearly $600 billion from the company's market cap when Chinese startup DeepSeek said its models rivaled those of OpenAI's Chat GPT at a fraction of the cost. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it is expecting to record a $5.5 billion first-quarter charge after the U.S. limited exports of its H20 chips to China. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect Nvidia declined to comment.

As it develops satellite-based cellular connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has reached an agreement designed to prevent the company’s massive BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. On Monday, the Texas-based company signed a “coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The deal calls for AST to “implement best practices between satellite communications and ground-based optical, infrared, and radio astronomy observations. “Under this agreement, AST SpaceMobile commits to collaborate closely with NSF, its major facilities, and the broader US astronomy community to mitigate any potential impact on ground-based astronomical facilities,” the company added. Importantly, AST has committed to adopting recommendations from the International Astronomical Union’s Dark and Quiet Skies initiative (IAU/CPS), which formed in 2022 in response to the rise of “mega” satellite constellations. This includes SpaceX’s Starlink, which has incorporated various design changes to prevent the satellites from reflecting sunlight in the night sky. In AST’s case, the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites already feature a vast, 693-square-foot communications array. As a result, the satellites can appear as bright stars in the night sky, according to astronomers. The interference risk may grow more serious since AST plans to launch dozens of even larger, second-generation BlueBirds, each 2,400 square feet. But on Monday, CEO Abel Avellan said the agreement with NSF underscores its “commitment to responsible stewardship of space.” AST didn’t elaborate on what measures it’ll take to prevent such interference. But in January, the company sent a letter to the FCC that noted it plans on rolling or tilting its satellites “to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes." AST also wants to install new antennas designed to reduce the satellites' brightness. Despite the agreement, Anthony Mallama, a retired astronomer who studies satellites for their brightness, told PCMag that he's skeptical the coordination deal will make a major difference. "The AST BlueBird Block 1 spacecraft are currently the brightest constellation by far with an average apparent magnitude of 3.3," he said. "That is 30 times brighter than the limit recommended by the IAU/CPS. The forthcoming Block 2 satellites will be 3 times the size of Block 1. So, they may outshine every star in the sky." In the meantime, the NSF agreement is important not only for astronomers but also for AST’s efforts to receive further regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission. In the past, the FCC has conditioned Starlink satellite approvals on working with the NSF to prevent interference with astronomy research. Last week, SpaceX even criticized AST’s request to launch a prototype second-generation BlueBird, the FM-1, saying the company had yet to explain how it would prevent the satellite from interfering with optical astronomy. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Title: What’s The Vibe In The U.S. Tech Sector

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Female data scientist is using a digital tablet with graphical electronic circuit projection The U.S. tech sector is contending with a combination of innovation along with job instability. The vibe is resilient, but anxious. A U.S. News survey shows 80% of tech workers report job satisfaction. They cite high pay and impact, but posts on the X platform reveal growing pessimism, with 65% of tech workers surveyed by The Information expecting worse conditions, driven by layoffs and hiring pullbacks. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Forbes, Layoffs.fyi, and executive search firm Robert Half, alongside sentiment from the vocal X platform, here’s a snapshot of the tech sector’s pulse. This includes the range of what’s happening in the job market to dream employers and the daily grind.

Title: Analysts revise Nvidia price target on chip demand

An "indefinite future" refers to a time that is not clearly defined, determined, or specific. It's kind of like the old Johnny Mathis song "The Twelfth of Never" only without the music, but the idea is the same: Don't hold your breath. 💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰 Nvidia (NVDA) got that message earlier this month when the U.S. government told the AI-chipmaking colossus that it would need to obtain a license to export its H20 chips to China, including Hong Kong and Macao. As a result, Nvidia said it expects to take a $5.5 billion charge in its fiscal 2026 first quarter due to H20 chip inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves. "The USG informed the Company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future," Nvidia said in a regulatory filing. Nvidia shares are down 17.4% in 2025 as the Santa Clara, CA-based tech giant got whacked a series of unfortunate events, starting with the arrival of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI company the produces large language models (LLMs) that are a lot cheaper than its competitors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has seen his company's shares slide. Then, President Donald Trump announced his global tariff agenda that pushed levies on Chinese goods to 145%. China raised its reciprocal tariffs to 125% for all goods originating from the United States in response to Trump’s move. Trump later said the tariffs levied against China were going to be substantially decreased. Nvidia's stock took another drubbing after reports emerged that Chinese tech titan Huawei was ramping up production of its AI chips, potentially impacting Nvidia's market share in China. More Nvidia: Nvidia has been the dominant player in the Chinese AI chip market, but U.S. export restrictions have limited the company's ability to supply their most advanced chips. Huawei is looking to capitalize on the restrictions by offering a competitive AI chip to the Chinese market. Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month, according to Reuters. The timing is fortuitous for Chinese AI companies which have been left scrambling for domestic alternatives to Nvidia H20. So, all in all, it's probably fair to say that, so far, 2025 hasn't been a banner year for Nvidia. But there's some good new on the horizon. China appears to have rolled back their retaliatory tariffs of 125% on some semiconductors made in the US, CNN reported on April 25. The exemptions, which have not been officially announced, apply to integrated circuits, also known as microchips or semiconductors. In addition to semiconductors, China has decided to grant exemptions on some aircraft parts, including engines and landing gear. While China has made strides in developing its own semiconductor industry, it is still highly dependent on imports of chips and chipmaking equipment from the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands. Last year, China imported $11.7 billion worth of semiconductors from the U.S. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) executives said that the construction of artificial intelligence data centers is not slowing down, as recession fears have some investors questioning whether tech companies will pull back on some of their plans, according to CNBC. “There’s been really no significant change,” Kevin Miller, Amazon’s vice president of global data centers, said at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy. “We continue to see very strong demand, and we’re looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up.” Miller said “there’s been little tea leaf reading and extrapolating to strange results” about Amazon’s plans. Nvidia, which reports quarterly results on May 28, is also not seeing signs of a slowdown, said Josh Parker, the chipmaker’s senior director of corporate sustainability. He added that Nvidia sees compute and energy demand only rising due to AI, describing the reaction to DeepSeek as “kneejerk.” Morgan Stanley analysts are worried about an AI slow down. The firm lowered its price target on Nvidia to $160 from $162 while keeping an overweight rating on the shares. As investor sentiment is worsening based on macro and supply chain risks, Morgan Stanley said, core demand for GPUs has shot higher in the last four weeks amid a shortage of inference chips across most of the relevant LLMs, in all geographies. Morgan said that the idea that "we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand." “While Wall Street is wringing its hands over a laundry list of very real concerns, Silicon Valley focus has shifted to a very different challenge — growth in tokens generated of (by some accounts) more than 5X since the beginning of the year is very much straining the ecosystem and is driving a surge in investment to handle these workloads," the firm said. Near-term estimates are capped by export controls and still limited by Blackwell supply, referring to Nvidia's new line of processors, but that is ramping quickly, the firm said. Morgan Stanley said Nvidia remains a top pick. Want TheStreet’s best daily stock and investing news right in your inbox every weekday? Get our free flagship newsletter.

Title: Nvidia faces a new threat from Huawei

Chinese tech giant Huawei is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA+0.35%), according to a new report. Huawei Technologies will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips from manufacturers as soon as the end of May, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The processor is Huawei’s most powerful AI semiconductor to date. According to the report, Huawei is hopeful that the chips will be more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 AI training chip, which it released in 2022. The Shenzhen-based firm boosts the chip’s performance by packing in more silicon. Shares of Nvidia were down about 3.5% by late Monday morning. The chip is in the early stages of development and will need to undergo testing with an initial batch of customers to measure its performance, the sources said. Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it. The firm has been on a U.S.-trade blacklist for six years, and the U.S. restricts chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms in an effort to curb the country’s advancements with AI chip technology. The tightening restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations have dealt blows to Nvidia by limiting its potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular, to comply with U.S. export rules — but those rules became even stricter and barred the Santa Clara, California-based company from selling them in China. Beijing has slammed the U.S.’ approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $2.6 trillion. But its shares are down 22.5% this year in the face of Trump’s escalating trade war with China. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

The grant will also give $720,000 for scholarships from the TCSGF’s ‘Last Mile Fund,’ to help students graduate despite potential financial burdens. “This partnership with The BlackRock Foundation is a powerful investment in Georgia’s future workforce,” Greg Dozier, Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia, said. “By helping more students complete training and earn credentials—especially in rural communities and high-demand fields—we’re not only changing lives, we’re building the talent pipeline that keeps Georgia the number one state for business." Dozier said the Empowerment Fund was a good example of how public and private partnerships can expand opportunities across Georgia, help close skill gaps and support economic mobility.

Title: Looking beyond Pi Network? 5 underrated cryptos could 1000x in May’s bullish rebound

As the crypto market gears up for a potential surge, interest is shifting toward hidden digital assets with explosive growth prospects. Investors are eager to uncover the next big opportunity beyond well-known names. This article delves into five overlooked cryptocurrencies that might experience a hundredfold increase during May’s bullish momentum. XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key strengths of XYZVerse in the current market: Price prediction for $XYZ Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Is a 3000% surge possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Ondo Finance is changing how people access financial products. By blending traditional finance with blockchain, Ondo turns real-world assets into digital tokens. These assets are stable and earn income, like US Treasuries. This opens up high-quality financial products to more people. Ondo has two parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds decentralized finance tools. Together, they enhance Ondo’s offerings. In a market where trust is key, Ondo partners with firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. They prioritize transparency and legal compliance. Their product, USDY, combines the ease of a stablecoin with yield opportunities. Backed by US Treasuries, it’s a secure option for non-US investors. With many cryptocurrencies being volatile, USDY offers a stable and regulated alternative. Compared to others, its strong backing makes it attractive for those seeking stability and steady returns. Sui is a new blockchain platform designed to change the way we interact with Web3. Built as a layer-1 blockchain, Sui focuses on being secure, powerful, and able to grow. It uses a special object-centric data model and the Move programming language to fix problems found in other blockchains. This means Sui can handle more transactions quickly and safely, making it ready for global use. What sets Sui apart is its focus on the user experience. It removes common barriers that make blockchain hard to use. Features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions make it easier for people to use apps without complicated steps. Programmable transaction blocks let developers create apps that are friendly and easy to use. In a market filled with many coins, Sui stands out because of its strong technology and user-first approach. This makes it an attractive option in today’s market, especially as more people look for blockchain platforms that are both powerful and easy to use. Imagine a blockchain designed just for trading, with speed and security at its core. That’s Sei. It’s the first Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for exchanges, giving them an edge over the competition. Sei can handle a huge number of orders every second, and transactions are finalized in just 380 milliseconds. That’s faster than most other blockchains out there. Plus, it’s backed by big institutions, ensuring it’s secure and reliable. With the potential to grow over 323% by 2030, Sei is catching the eye of many investors. In today’s market, where speed and efficiency are key, Sei stands out. While other coins struggle with slow transaction times, Sei offers a swift and secure alternative. If you’re looking at current trends, where decentralized finance and quick trades are in demand, Sei looks like an attractive option. It’s tailored for the trading world, and that specialization could give it an advantage in the market. Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform designed to make decentralized finance (DeFi) faster and more efficient. It introduces its own Layer 1 blockchain, built from scratch to be quick and scalable. One of its standout features is HyperBFT, a special system that helps transactions confirm rapidly while keeping them secure. What’s really exciting is that Hyperliquid offers decentralized perpetual futures trading directly on its platform. Users can trade without paying any gas fees, which are common charges on other networks. Plus, Hyperliquid uses an on-chain order book, meaning all trades are visible and verifiable on the blockchain, increasing transparency and trust. In today’s crypto market, platforms that offer speed, low costs, and transparency are highly sought after. Hyperliquid’s approach sets it apart from many other decentralized exchanges that still have issues with high fees and slower transactions. The team behind Hyperliquid comes from top universities and industry leaders, showing strong expertise and innovation. While the crypto market is always changing, Hyperliquid’s focus on solving real problems could make it an attractive option for traders looking for efficient and cost-effective solutions. As more users seek better platforms for trading, Hyperliquid might become a key player in the DeFi space. In the current bull run, ONDO, SUI, SEI, and HYPE offer potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads with its sports-meme fusion, targeting 20,000% growth and empowering a community-driven ecosystem.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy as Strategy Buying Spree Is Turning Bitcoin Into a Premium Asset

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months. On average, the company has been acquiring 2,087 $BTC per day – a rate that far exceeds the current daily production rate of 450 $BTC, which comes to 13,500 $BTC per month. Keep reading to find out how institutional Bitcoin accumulation could reshape the market and why now might be a great opportunity to invest in the best altcoins to buy to benefit from this shift. By amassing such as dominant Bitcoin position, Strategy is moving toward a position where it could influence broader market trends. If institutions like Strategy control a sizable portion of Bitcoin’s fixed 21M supply, the asset may become a luxury in the future. In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders. Although this goes against Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos, it’s undeniably bullish for its price. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck. – Adam Livingston, a $BTC analyst Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin’s market cap to $200T. Some critics warn that Strategy’s debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency’s protocol. Even if institutions control over 50% of the supply, they have no incentive to manipulate the protocol. Forking Bitcoin to create more coins would only devalue their holdings, leading to large losses. Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case. If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin’s scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Smart investors are positioning now. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is easily the best Bitcoin-centric altcoin on the market right now. Designed to follow the king cryptocurrency’s coattails, it’s the first-ever and only crypto to offer free Bitcoin to its token holders. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin’s growth. What’s more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin’s price increases by $25K. The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on. Don’t miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. Here’s a guide on how to buy it. A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. With rising crypto prices across the board, it’d be the perfect time to be a crypto trader and investor. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they’ve taken off is an uphill task. That’s why you’re better off using MIND of Pepe ($MIND), an autonomous AI agent coin offering crypto investment advice. $MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone’s opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode. Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI’s newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves. If you buy $MIND today, you’ll have to spend just $0.0037465 per token. Mother Iggy launched towards the end of March and was more or less flat for the first three weeks. It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. It’s currently the top-trending crypto in the entire market. As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come. Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity. They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity’s popularity. This ultimately leads to violent upmoves, i.e., if the token is lucky enough to be successful. $MOTHER is. Currently trading at just $0.01982, $MOTHER might just as well be in the early stages of a huge rally. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now. With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC. However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns. Finally, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice.

April 28, 2025 10:40 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q1 2025 Hedge Fund Barometer, which showed a significant reversal of pro-growth positions in both U.S. equities and corporate bonds over the quarter as well as an increase in bets on gold. According to Unlimited’s proprietary technology, hedge fund managers came into the year with relatively low conviction and modest views but subsequently ramped up pro-growth positions including long the U.S. dollar, and credit spread and equity bets in line with increased expectations of U.S. growth from the new administration. The majority of those positions were reversed starting in February with the exception of extending bullish positions on gold. “Hedge fund positioning shows some of the lowest conviction in the direction of asset prices that we have seen in decades,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and CIO of Unlimited and portfolio manager of actively-managed ETFs. “Those positions were a dramatic transition from the beginning of the quarter when hedge funds were ramping up their bullish bets on the U.S. economy. The prominence of policy volatility likely triggered managers' reluctance to hold significant directional positions.” Hedge funds eked out modestly positive performance in the first quarter with the mix of sub-strategy returns largely reversing the moves of the previous quarter. Emerging Market funds outperformed meaningfully as Chinese stocks surged meanwhile Equity Long/Short and Event Driven strategies came in weak. 1Q25 Hedge Fund Strategy Performance, Gross of Fees Unlimited’s Hedge Fund Barometer showed other notable moves during the quarter included: Click here to view a video on how Unlimited’s technology works.

Title: What is the Inverse Cramer Meme? Jokes About Following the Opposite of Jim Cramer's Investment Advice, Explained

Matt Schimkowitz • 6 years ago Mateus Lima • about a month ago Sakshi Rakshale • about a month ago Owen Carry • 2 days ago Sakshi Rakshale • 2 months ago 🗳 Cast Your Vote To Select The Meme Of The Month! 🗳 Published April 27, 2025 Jim Cramer is one of the most recognizable figures in American finance media, known for his energetic stock picks and bold predictions on CNBC's Mad Money. Over the years, however, a growing number of investors and internet users have noticed a pattern: Cramer's recommendations during crucial market moments have not performed well. In response, online communities developed the "Inverse Cramer" meme and slang term, a running joke and informal strategy suggesting that doing the opposite of Cramer’s advice could be more profitable. Here’s how the meme started, why it spread, and what it looks like today. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money since March 2005, is infamous for dramatic, sometimes ill-fated investment advice. During the 2008 financial crisis, Cramer advised buying Bear Stearns, just weeks before it collapsed. He also encouraged holding onto Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers before their infamous downfalls. A clip of the show uploaded by YouTuber politiclips on March 17th, 2008, has over 500,000 views 17 years later. The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2009 that betting against Cramer’s "buys" could net a 25 percent return in a month. CBS News confirmed similar findings in 2012, with a 22 percent portfolio gain in just 22 days by doing the opposite. The "Inverse Cramer" meme suggests that one can succeed in the stock market simply by doing the opposite of Jim Cramer’s advice. While jokes about this date back to 2008, the phrase "Inverse Cramer" first surfaced on Twitter via @WSBConsensus on October 10, 2017, in a post about shorting NVIDIA and going long on AMD, which echoed in a popular /r/Amd thread on Reddit later that month. Don't forget the infamous "Inverse Cramer" Short $NVDA Long $AMD #BuyNVDAPuts #BuyAMDCalls $MU $APPL $GOOGL $HMNY https://t.co/9QUvAetUTv — WallStreetBets & Co. (@WSBConsensus) October 10, 2017 The idea found a home in online finance communities like the subreddit /r/WallStreetBets and FinTwit by 2019, where posts joking about "inversing" Cramer routinely earned hundreds to thousands of upvotes. As Cramer’s misfires piled up, the meme matured from a casual jab into a half-serious investment philosophy. On December 15th, 2021, Twitter user @iAnonPatriot posted a screenshot of Cramer tweeting negatively about AMC Entertainment stock. Despite Cramer’s warning, AMC’s share price rose significantly, leading @iAnonPatriot to caption it with sarcasm and highlight the inverse trend. The next day, on December 16th, Redditor /u/jsza87 posted to /r/wallstreetbets with the title "Always inverse Jim Cramer," gathering over 8,000 upvotes since. The post featured a collage of stock tickers that all declined sharply after Cramer had recommended them. By early March 2023, the joke had grown large enough that Redditor /u/HYPED_UP_ON_CHARTS announced, "The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Has Officially Arrived," on /r/wallstreetbets. The post, which earned over 9,000 upvotes in the last two years, presented an ETF that allowed people to automatically short stocks recommended by Cramer. What started as a meme has turned into an actual, tradable financial strategy. The meme stayed relevant through new market events even into this year. For instance, on April 5th, 2025, after Cramer warned of a coming "Black Monday" stock crash, X user @fprosk joked, "We are really testing the limits of the Reverse Jim Cramer now," gathering over 50,000 likes in just a couple of days. Finally, the meme broke into even bigger mainstream attention when Elon Musk referenced it. On April 25th, 2025, after Jim Cramer said during a CNBC segment, "I'm putting my chips on Elon Musk," Musk responded on X with, "Uh oh 😬 Inverse Cramer is tough karma to overcome! I’m calling weekend reviews with Autopilot to accelerate progress." For the full history of Inverse Cramer, be sure to check out Know Your Meme's encyclopedia entry for more information.

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

Full Content:
Among various cancers, primary liver cancer is the seventh most diagnosed malignancy and is the second most prevalent contributor to cancer-causing deaths. During conventional treatment, the recurrence of disease, low drug inefficacy, and severe side effects are the main limitations. Recently, natural anticancer medicines from the Middle East, Korea, China, Europe, North America, and India have attracted a lot of interest due to their low side effects and better remedial properties. The current study investigated the antioxidative and anticancer effects of ethanolic (BME) and n-hexane (BMH) extracts of B. monnieri (L.) Wettst. In the current study, phytochemical profiling was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The antioxidant potential was measured using DPPH, nitric oxide, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide assays, while the cell viability and apoptotic effect were measured by MTT, crystal violet, and annexin V/PI protocols, respectively. Higher concentrations of total phenolic contents (274.92±3.52 mgGAE/g), total flavonoid contents (141.99±4.14 mgQE/g) and tannins (55.49±4.63 mgTAE/g) were observed in BME extract with strong antioxidant potential than BMH extract. Also, BME extract showed higher cytotoxicity with less IC50 value (24.70 μg/mL) and a lower percentage of cell viability, while the same extract exhibited 58.65% apoptosis against HepG2 cells in comparison to cisplatin and BMH extract. Furthermore, Spiro[(tricyclo[6.2.2.0(2,7)]dodeca-5,9-diene)-4,1’-cyclobutane]-11,2’-dione from BME extract showed the lead docking score of -8.8, -8.1 and -7.8 kcal/mol against TGF-βR1, TNF-α, and iNOS, respectively. In conclusion, the ethanolic extract of B. monnieri has a significant potential for becoming a potent anticancer drug that effectively treats liver damage, including HCC.

According to the recent estimates, 830,200 deaths and 905700 cases of liver cancer were observed in 2020. The American Cancer Society estimated that diagnosis of 41,210 cases (27,980 in men and 13,230 in women) and 29,380 fatalities (10,380 cases in females and 19,000 in males) found in 2023 [2]. It is also estimated that 1.4 million expected cases with 1.3 million mortalities will be expected in 2040 [3]. The most prevalent forms of primary liver cancer include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (10–15%) and other liver malignancies [4]. Almost ninety percent of HCCs have recognized underlying etiologies, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, severe alcoholism, and chronic viral hepatitis [5]. Prolonged inflammation, oxidative stress, tissue remodeling, genetic changes, and deregulated cellular signaling are thought to be the important mechanisms involved in HCC development and progression [6]. Recently, the primary treatment options for HCC include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, local ablation therapy, and liver transplantation. These conventional therapies are efficient at early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma but are ineffective at advanced stages due to the development of serious adverse effects such as metastasis, frequent recurrence, drug resistance, and many others [7]. Thus, substantial research is required to discover and develop novel anticancer drugs considering the increasing risk of drug-resistant malignancies with fewer side effects [8]. In the past few decades, considerable attention has been given to medicinal plants and herbal extracts containing valuable phytoconstituents with structural diversity and novel therapeutics to inhibit or destroy cancerous cells by overcoming drug resistance during cancer treatment [9]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than eighty percent of the global population opts for these traditional medicinal plant-based treatment options [10]. Medicinal plants possess a wide range of bioactive compounds such as catechins, polyphenols, flavonoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and a plethora of others, which may reduce cell proliferation due to their anti-angiogenic, anti-mutagenic, antioxidant and anti-cancer properties [11]. Moreover, plant-derived phytocompounds offer better safety and efficacy because of their distinct molecular characteristics and diverse structure [12]. In medicinal plants, GC-MS analysis is an indispensable technique for identifying therapeutically important compounds [13]. In this context, molecular docking is an economical and efficient method for testing and developing natural medicines. This method provides information on the interaction between natural ligands and receptors, which may be used to predict how the drug will attach to target proteins to elucidate the underlying biochemical processes that are disrupted in pathological conditions [14]. Over many years, the concept of inflammation-induced cancer has been recognized, and numerous research has proven that pro-inflammatory cytokines in tumor microenvironment influence every stage of tumor development and treatment efficacy[15]. These inflammatory cytokines are considered a promising target in several cancer treatments. Among various cytokines, TNF-α and TGF-β are essential in playing different functions at various stages of tumor development [16]. TNF-α is an important inflammation-causing cytokine, mostly produced through macrophages, although it is also secreted by various malignant cells that promote tumor metastasis, migration, proliferation and invasion through activating TNF-α-induced PKCα-, NF-кB, and AP-1signaling pathway [17]. Previous research has shown that serum levels of TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines were considerably greater in HCC patients compared to healthy individuals; hence, elevated TNF-α levels were linked to HCC progression and development [18]. Notably, TGF-β has a dual function in cancer development. At early stages, it inhibits cell proliferation by initiating apoptosis in cancer cells. While at later stages, it promoted tumor growth by inducing angiogenesis, immune suppression, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway [19]. A high-throughput proteomics analysis of early HCC tissue samples demonstrated that invasive HCC tissues were found to have a significant expression of TGF-β levels [20]. Furthermore, nitric oxide is generated by endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS(iNOS) and is involved in the initiation and development of cancer [21]. Excessive or prolonged NO synthesis has been linked with various characteristics of tumor formation, such as genomic instability, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and metastasis [22]. Elevated levels of NO (1200 μmol/L) were observed in HCC patients before undergoing radiofrequency thermal ablation than control (22 μmol/L). Bacopa monnieri, locally known as Brahmi, belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is a small creeping herb that grows in moist areas throughout Europe, Australia, India, Asia, Africa, and South and North America [23]. B. monnieri is an excellent reservoir of bioactive compounds, including bacoside A & B, triterpenoid saponins, nicotine, betulinic acid, stigmasterol, bacopasides I & II, herpestine, D-mannitol, cucurbitacin, and several others are extensively investigated for their antioxidant, nootropic, bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anticancer properties [24]. Extensive research and clinical studies support these conventional pharmacological assertions. Traditionally, it is widely used to treat a variety of oxidative stress-related health disorders, such as neurological disorders, malignancies, diabetes, and heart complications [25]. Different B. monneiri extracts and their valuable phytochemicals showed promising anti-tumor effects by suppressing proliferation, stimulating apoptosis, and reducing migration and invasion in several human cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 & MCF-7 (breast cancer), HT-29 (colon cancer), DU-145 (prostate cancer) and Cal33 & FaDu (oral cancer)[26, 27]. In another study, it was observed that bacoside A showed an anti-metatastic effect in Wistar albino rats with DEN-induced HCC by downregulating the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and lipid peroxidation along with increased antioxidant enzymes levels [28]. Recently, no study has been available in elucidating the therapeutic potential of B. monnieri extracts to evaluate the underlying mechanism of TNF-α, TGF-β, and iNOS having a well-established role in HCC development. In our study, we determined the antioxidative, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activities of B. monnieri extracts using various in-vitro methods. This is the first-hand report to pinpoint the active anti-HCC ingredients of B. monnieri after targeting TNF-α, TGF-β, and iNOS proteins through molecular docking. This study will provide a solid scientific reason for the use of natural alternatives for the HCC treatment, but further research is required to verify the therapeutics of selected phytoconstituents in clinical and in-vivo trials. All analytical grade chemicals and solvents were obtained from different companies. The whole plant of B. monnieri (L.) Wettst was purchased from the local herbal market in Lahore, Pakistan. At Government College University (Lahore, Pakistan), a taxonomist identified and gave a voucher number of GC. Herb.Bot-3781 to the plant. It was submitted to the Government College University Herbarium Bank. The plant extracts were prepared according to the protocol given by Al-Nuri [29]. The leaves were dried under shade and were ground into powder by a laboratory grinding mill. The plant was macerated in ethanol (90%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and n-hexane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) solvents for two weeks. After maceration, a rotary evaporator was used to concentrate the filtered solution at 40 ºC (Heidolph Hei-Vap, Germany). This concentrated mixture was achieved with lyophilizer, and a percentage yield of 11.55% of ethanolic and 7.35% of n-hexane extracts of B. monnieri was obtained. The concentration of total flavonoids was measured through a colorimetric aluminum chloride assay given by Phuyal and colleagues [30]. The absorbances were taken at 510 nm. The quantity of TFCs (total flavonoids contents) was estimated as mg equivalents of quercetin/g of dry extract using the standard curve obtained from the known concentrations of standard reagent. The concentration of TPCs (total phenolic contents) was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure [31]. TPCs were noted as mg GAE/g of dry extract). Tannins concentration was estimated following the Folin-Ciocalteu method [32]. Concentrations were estimated as mgTAE/g of dried weight of plant extracts. For GC-MS analysis, lyophilized samples of B. monnieri were sent to the ICCBS center (International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences) at Karachi University to identify different phytocompounds [33]. The instrument utilized was a TQQQ Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) with a QP-5000 MS (mass spectrometer; quadruple) and a polydimethylsiloxane-clad capillary GC column. As a mobile phase, 99.99% pure helium was used to flow constantly at an average of 1 mL/min. At 250 ºC, the temperature of the injector was maintained with a 1 L injection volume having a 10:1 split ratio. The temperature in the oven was initially operated for 3 minutes at 50 °C, then increased by 7 °C per minute to 280 °C over 25 minutes before being raised to 300 °C (final temperature). For GC–MS spectrum detection, samples were conducted at 40–600 m/z with a scanning period of 0.2 seconds and 70 electron volts of ionization energy. The phytochemicals were detected by comparing the peak height, peak area %, retention time, and the diverse patterns of the mass spectrum of all phytochemicals found in the sample extracts with the spectral database of already available reference compounds present in the NIST library (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The antioxidant ability of plant extracts in terms of scavenging free radicals was evaluated in a procedure given by Braca [34]. Firstly, a fresh DPPH stock solution was made with 0.004% w/v in 95 percent methanol. To make stock solutions, 5 mg of ascorbic acid (standard reagent) and plant extracts were mixed in their mother solvents. Different concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μg/mL) of plant extracts, along with reference reagent (ascorbic acid), were used to prepare by sequential dilutions. Each sample (0.1 mL) was combined with DPPH solution (3 mL) and stored in a pitch-dark area for thirty minutes after thoroughly shaking. A control was also prepared using the same reagents but without plant extracts. The optical density of extracts and ascorbic acid was recorded spectrophotometrically with the wavelength of 517 nm against blank. The percent inhibition of the free radicals was calculated by the following equation: Nitric oxide is formed by Na2[Fe(CN)5NO] (sodium nitroprusside), and their scavenging potential was evaluated using the method given by Kamble [35]. In the reaction mixture, 1.0 mL of PBS (phosphate buffer saline; pH 7.4), 0.5 mL of sodium nitroprusside (10 mM), 1.0 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 1.0 mL of each sample at varying concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 µg/mL, was kept for 4 hours at ambient temperature. A control was prepared using the aforementioned reagents but without plant extract. The mixture was undergoing centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Afterwards, 0.5 mL of Griess reagent was mixed with 0.5 mL of supernatant, and results were measured at 546 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as a reference reagent. The reduction percentage of RNS was estimated through the given formula: The antioxidant potential of crude extracts to inhibit superoxide anion radicals was evaluated by a previously described procedure [36]. The reaction mixture contains 1.0 mL of both nitroblue tetrazolium [(1M of NBT in PBS (100 mM; pH 7.4) and NADH solution (1M of NADH in PBS (100 mM; pH 7.4)], 1.0 mL of and 0.1 mL of each plant extract or standard reagent (both have concentrations ranging between 50–250 μg/mL). Additionally, 0.1 mL of phenazine methosulphate solution started the reaction and was kept at 20 °C for five minutes. The readings of each sample were taken at 560 nm compared to blank. A control was made with the same reagents except any plant extracts. The following equation was used to determine the scavenging capacity of plant samples: The potential of plant extracts to scavenge hydrogen peroxide radicals was determined using a previously given method [37]. A fresh solution of hydrogen peroxide (2.0 mM) was prepared with the help of phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4; 50 mM). Briefly, 0.1 mL of sample (at varying concentrations of 50–250 μg/mL) was added into 0.3 mL of PBS and 0.6 mL of H2O2 solution and left the mixture for ten minutes at 37 °C. The absorbance of all testing samples and ascorbic acid was measured at 230 nm against blank. The scavenging of hydrogen peroxide was calculated by the following equation: The human liver cancer cell line (HepG2) was obtained from cell line BioBank present at the IMBB (Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology), The University of Lahore, Pakistan. The HepG2 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Minimum Essential Medium) that was supplemented with antibiotic (streptomycin/penicillin) and fetal bovine serum (10% FBS). The cells were cultured in a T-75 cell culture flask and incubated at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 and 95% air in an incubator (BioTek, Korea). The media was changed every 3–4 days to ensure proper cell growth. The cells were re-cultured after every four to five days [38]. Based on treatments, HepG2 cells were segregated into four distinct groups. As a negative control, cells that received DMEM medium were designated as the untreated cells (UT). The other two groups were treated with different BME and BMH extract doses. As a positive control, cisplatin (a commonly used FDA-approved anticancer drug) was given at varying concentrations to the final (fourth) group for comparison. The cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was estimated via the standard protocol of MTT assay [39]. HepG2 cells (1x104 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well culture plate. After incubation of 24 hours, cells received increasing concentrations (10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL) of the plant extracts and cisplatin (positive control) [40], while untreated cells served as negative control received only media. These cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for the next twenty-four hours. After incubation, cells were rinsed using 200 µL of PBS following the removal of media. Then, MTT reagent (25 μL) was introduced in each well and left at 37 °C for 3 hours. Then, the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO after removing MTT dye. The results were taken at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotommeter (BioRad, Singapore). Every experiment was conducted in triplicates. The non-linear regression analysis was utilized to calculate the IC50 values using a graph pad prism (version 5.03). To observe the therapeutic impact of BME and BMH extracts on the cancer cell morphologies, 1x104 cells were cultivated in a 96-well flat bottom plate. The cultured cells were exposed to different doses (10 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL) of both plant extracts and cisplatin for 24 hrs, and the images of morphological changes were observed using a microscope [35]. The percentages of adherent cells, or live HepG2 cells, were measured by crystal violet staining [41]. After the cultivated cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, they were treated for 24 hours with various IC50 concentrations of crude extracts and cisplatin, which were calculated using the MTT assay. Following treatment, the medium was removed using PBS solution, and 0.05 mL of crystal violet dye (0.5%) was introduced in each well for staining live cells. These plates were left at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then, the excess stain was washed out with PBS. After drying overnight, the extra stain was removed from the treated cells by applying 50 µL of ethanoic acid (10%). The absorbances were estimated at 600 nm. The percent HepG2 cell viability was estimated after the administration of plant extracts and cisplatin in the following way: To estimate the apoptosis effect induced by the extracts in cancer cells, the apoptotic activity was measured following the kit manufacturer’s instructions (annexin V/PI) (Merck-Millipore; MCH100105) [42]. HepG2 cells (5x105 cells per well) were grown on 12-well plates and then exposed to respective IC50 concentrations of cisplatin and extracts for treatment. The cancer cells were centrifuged for 5 mins at 1000 rpm, washed with PBS, and put in 1x binding buffer (100 µL). Then, propidium iodide (10 µL) and annexin V-FITC binding (5 µL) were used to stain the suspended cells and left at room temperature for 15 minutes. The automated cell Muse Analyzer (Merck-Millipore) was used to measure the outcomes of cell death induction. Three-dimensional TNF-α, TGF-βR1 and iNOS structures, having the PDB IDs 2AZ5 (only chain A), 1RW8 (only chain A), and 4NOS, respectively, were retrieved from Protein Data Bank. These proteins were selected as a molecular target for this investigation because these are implicated in many processes of liver disorders that, if not treated at an early stage, may develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Targeting these proteins may reduce the severity of various advanced hepatic complications. The selected target proteins were prepared by eliminating undesired co-crystallized ligands and water molecules before the addition of partial charges allocated to atoms, Gasteiger charges, Kollman charges and polar hydrogen using Discovery Studio [43]. The prediction of active sites is to determine the precise functional region of the protein to comprehend its activity. The active amino acid residues in binding pockets of target receptors were inferred using the literature survey or using PYMOL [44]. Specified dimensions of different grid boxes for target macromolecules are depicted in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t001 Different phytocompounds were screened in both extracts of B. monnieri using GC-MS analysis to investigate the potent hepatoprotective drug candidates. The structures of identified compounds were downloaded in SDF files from the PubChem or ChemSpider databases and saved in a pdb file. The ligands were optimized through energy minimization and changed to a Pdbqt file by utilizing the AutoDock Vina program for further analysis [45]. The drug-likeness of identified phytochemicals was predicted using SwissADME software. The drug-likeness of a phytoconstituent depends on following Lipinski’s rules. SwissADME (https://www.SwissADME.ch) is a tool to investigate different parameters of Lipinski’s rules [46]. PkCSM (https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/pkcsm/prediction) and admetSAR (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/) are free online software that was used for various toxicity parameters assessment. Hepatotoxicity was assessed using the pkCSM program [47], whereas acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity mutagenicity, and acute oral toxicity variables were determined utilizing the admetSAR tool [48]. Compounds were selected based on drug-like properties for molecular docking to identify a safe drug. To predict these parameters, the software was uploaded with the canonical SMILES of the ligands. This computational study excluded the natural chemicals that had one or more violations of Lipinski’s rules or displayed a positive sign for any toxicity parameter. The filtered compounds were further subjected to molecular docking against selected target proteins. The drug-like ligands and proteins were prepared using the AutoDock vina tool (version 1.5.7), which reduced energy and set a grid box to cover all amino acids in the active site defined by co-crystallization. Both molecules (proteins and ligands) were converted and saved in a pdbqt format [49]. Vina used a global optimization algorithm to accomplish docking, taking information from both input files (proteins and ligands) and specified dimensions listed in the configuration file of the grid box. After connecting with the target receptors, nine different conformations were generated for each ligand; the best binding affinities were used to select the ideal position [50]. Macromolecules were taken as rigid entities during the docking process, and different conformations were produced by maintaining the flexibility of ligands. The lowest favorable binding energy establishes the stable association between the target receptor and ligand, having an RMSD value <1Å (Angstrom), which is defined as its lowest favorable binding energy. The lowest binding affinities and the molecular interactions of phytocompounds with active site residues of target proteins were analyzed in detail compared to standard drug [51]. To form a stable docked complex, the target macromolecule was aligned with a stable conformer that was selected based on best binding affinities [52]. PYMOL (version 2.5.4) was utilized to analyze the post-dock outcomes by further examining and visualizing the docked complexes. The 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images were captured by BIOVIA Discovery Studio (client 2021) [53]. The ligand-protein interactions are involved in forming stable docked complexes and are measured using a web server protein-ligand profiler [54]. Usually, the selected drug candidates were subjected to the ADMET analysis (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity) using different online software to predict their safety in animal and human systems. The initial toxicological study of the expected candidate is a fundamental step in designing and developing a safe and effective medicine before undergoing a pharmacological trial [55]. We used the PkCSM tool for early-stage toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiling of selected plant-based chemicals [56]. All the data was evaluated by one-way ANOVA (analysis of variances) with post-hoc Tukey’s test for comparison between treatment groups. For data analysis and IC50 calculations, GraphPad Prism (version 5.03) and Statistix (version 8.0) software were used for data analysis. Results were given as mean ± Standard deviation of three independent experiments (n=3). It is observed that analysis was statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. Before performing ANOVA, homogeneity of variance and normal distribution of data were evaluated using Bartlett’s and Shapiro-Wilks tests. It has been confirmed that the experimental data collection complied with relevant institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation with appropriate permissions from authorities of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Lahore, Lahore 54300, Pakistan. The concentration of important pharmacologically active agents in each plant extract was also measured quantitatively (Table 2). For all crude extracts, TFCs (total flavonoid contents) were calculated utilizing the linear regression equation taken from the standard curve of quercetin (y = 0.0023 x - 0.1754, R2 = 0.9904). The values of tannins and TPCs (total phenolic contents) in the experimental samples were determined by the tannic acid calibration curve equation (y = 0.0012x + 0.0644, R2 = 0.9855) and the standard curve equation of gallic acid (y = 0.0026x + 0.5142, R2 = 0.9976), respectively. In general, BME extract exhibited significantly higher contents of flavonoids, tannins, and phenols than BMH extract and has made an important contribution to their biological activities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t002 GC-MS analysis detected different types and concentrations of natural compounds in both extracts of B. monnieri. These identified compounds are given in Fig 1. The secondary metabolites present in both extracts of B. monnieri belong to important classes of therapeutically important secondary metabolites such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, cholesterol, steroids, terpenoids, phytosterol, vitamins, sesquiterpene and phenolic compounds (Table 3). Most of these compounds were considered medicinally active due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-tumor attributes. Different solvents have varying polarities that are depicted with different peak locations and peak lengths in the chromatogram. The solubility of compounds in different solvents also affects their elution times. BME extract (A) identified a diverse array of polar compounds with higher peak lengths and earlier peak locations than BMH extract (B). Different solvents have varying polarities that are depicted with different peak locations and peak lengths in the chromatogram. The solubility of compounds in different solvents also affects their elution times. BME extract (A) identified a diverse array of polar compounds with higher peak lengths and earlier peak locations than BMH extract (B). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t003 Percentage free radical inhibition for the plant samples and standard antioxidants was calculated using DPPH antioxidant assay. The DPPH scavenging potential of B. monnieri extracts was observed to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) in a concentration-reliant manner (Fig 2A). In Table 4, BME extract showed the best DPPH radical scavenging activity with minimum IC50 concentration (26.84 μg/mL) and a higher percentage of free radicals inhibitions, while the weaker scavenging percentage was noticed in BMH extract with the higher IC50 concentration of 85.63 μg/mL. Ascorbic acid showed maximum inhibition of free radicals (IC50: 13.28 μg/mL) compared to plant extracts. The antiradical potential of plant extracts was found to decrease in the following order: ASA>BME>BMH. One-way ANOVA following Tukey’s test was used to analyze the data and found statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. The same letters indicated that the difference was not statistically significant, while different lower-case letters demonstrated statistically significant differences across groups. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and expressed as mean±SD. One-way ANOVA following Tukey’s test was used to analyze the data and found statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. The same letters indicated that the difference was not statistically significant, while different lower-case letters demonstrated statistically significant differences across groups. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and expressed as mean±SD. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t004 Each plant extract significantly (p-value < 0.05) increased the neutralization of nitric oxide radical with increasing concentrations, as given in Fig 2B. Among both extracts, the BME extract exhibited better scavenging of nitric oxide with an IC50 concentration of 46.04 μg/mL in comparison to BMH extract (IC50 value: 104.86 μg/mL). The higher inhibiting percentage of oxidant was observed in the case of ascorbic acid (IC50 value: 41.16 μg/mL). The decreasing antioxidant potential with increasing IC50 values was observed in the following order: ASA<BME<BMH (Table 4). Both B. monnieri extracts showed scavenging of superoxide anions in a concentration-dependent manner (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 μg/mL) as depicted in Fig 2C. The antioxidant activity of B. monnieri extracts was observed to decrease in the following order: ASA>BME>BMH (Table 4; Fig 2C). BME extract showed stronger superoxide anion scavenging activity (IC50: 60.95 μg/mL) than BMH extract with an IC50 concentration of 135.44 μg/mL. These extracts showed modest antioxidant activity (p-value<0.05) when compared to ascorbic acid (IC50: 47.33 μg/mL). Despite this, both extracts act as strong superoxide anion scavengers to neutralize oxidative stress. The antioxidant potential of plant extracts and standard reagent was found to be higher with increasing concentrations (Fig 2D). Higher percentages of free radical scavenging were observed in BME extract (IC50: 78.08 μg/mL) compared to BMH extract (IC50: 128.21 μg/mL). Ascorbic acid served as a standard and showed higher antioxidant potential (p-value < 0.05) with an IC50 value of 50.83 μg/mL compared to both extracts. The decreasing percentage of quenching H2O2 radicals with increasing IC50 values was observed in the following order: ASA>BME>BMH. The cytotoxicity of plant extracts in terms of IC50 concentrations was evaluated using an MTT assay against the HepG2 cells. The experiment was done with various concentrations of each extract and cisplatin, which served as the reference drug for comparison. The findings showed that increasing the concentration of both extracts and cisplatin causes higher cytotoxicity by reducing the number of viable cells compared to untreated cells (Fig 3). With an IC50 value of 24.70 µg/mL, BME extract was shown to be more cytotoxic than BMH extract (41.47 μg/mL), as it significantly reduced the proliferation of malignant cells. Furthermore, cisplatin proved less cytotoxic (IC50 value: 25.83 μg/mL) toward cancer cells as compared to BME extract but more active than BMH extract. The IC50 values (fifty percent inhibition of cancer cells) of all samples are presented in Table 5. The cytotoxicity of testing samples was increased in HepG2 cells with decreasing IC50 values in the following order: BMH>Cisplatin>BME. (A) HepG2-cells treated with BME extract (B) HepG2-cells treated with BMH extract (C) HepG2-cells treated with cisplatin. Data from triplicate experiments was expressed as mean±SD. One-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey’s tests for multiple comparisons (p-value < 0.05) was performed and significant differences between treatment groups were represented by different lowercase letters. UT: untreated cells. (A) HepG2-cells treated with BME extract (B) HepG2-cells treated with BMH extract (C) HepG2-cells treated with cisplatin.

Neoplastic cells were observed to change their shape, structure, and size in a dose-reliant manner. At doses of 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, BME and cisplatin sharply reduced the viability of HepG2 cells along with prominent degenerated cell morphologies. While on administration of BMH extract, any prominent alterations in the shape of viable cells were observed at higher concentrations (50 and 100 µg/mL) when compared to untreated cells. At doses of 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, BME and cisplatin-induced remarkable morphological changes in cancer cells, whereas BMH extract started the induction of notable morphological changes at 50 µg/mL. BME: ethanolic extract of B. monnieri; BMH: B. monnieri n- hexane extract of B. monnieri; UT: untreated cells. The images were taken at 50× magnifying power using a Floid cell imaging station. At doses of 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, BME and cisplatin-induced remarkable morphological changes in cancer cells, whereas BMH extract started the induction of notable morphological changes at 50 µg/mL. BME: ethanolic extract of B. monnieri; BMH: B. monnieri n- hexane extract of B. monnieri; UT: untreated cells. The images were taken at 50× magnifying power using a Floid cell imaging station. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g004 Crystal violet assay was used to determine the percentage cell viability of HepG2 cells. Following the treatment with varying IC50 concentrations of cisplatin and B. monnieri extracts, HepG2 cells were shown to have a higher level of apoptotic activity with the lower percentages of live cells in comparison to the untreated cells. A very small percentage of dead cells were seen in untreated HepG2 cells compared to treated groups (Fig 5). In short, BME extract was found to have a higher inhibitory potential on the multiplication of HepG2 cells with a lower viability percentage compared to BMH extract and cisplatin. Data from experiments were given as mean±SD (n=3) and considered statistically significant at a p-value less than 0.05. Different alphabets showed a significant difference between the treatment groups, and these results were obtained by performing one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. UT: untreated; BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract-treated HepG2 cells; BMH: B. monnieri n-hexane extract-treated HepG2 cells; Cisplatin served as a positive control. Data from experiments were given as mean±SD (n=3) and considered statistically significant at a p-value less than 0.05. Different alphabets showed a significant difference between the treatment groups, and these results were obtained by performing one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. UT: untreated; BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract-treated HepG2 cells; BMH: B. monnieri n-hexane extract-treated HepG2 cells; Cisplatin served as a positive control. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g005 Annexin V-FITC/PI kit was used to evaluate the apoptotic ability of plant extracts on HepG2 cells. Following treatment with extracts and cisplatin, the percentage of apoptotic induction in HepG2 cells is depicted in Fig 6. In BME-treated HepG2 cells, the higher percentage of apoptosis was 58.65% compared to its BMH extract (48.45%). This may be due to the presence of the higher concentrations of phytochemicals with anticancer potential. The apoptotic percentage of HepG2 cells treated with cisplatin was shown to be 58.95%. BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract; BMH: B. monnieri hexane extract; UT: untreated cells. BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract; BMH: B. monnieri hexane extract; UT: untreated cells. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g006 In comparison to untreated cells, all the treatment groups mostly showed an excessive amount of dead cells in their late apoptotic profiles. Following the incubating period, 1.15% of early apoptosis and 3.75% of late apoptosis were observed. The phytoconstituents showed at least one violation of Lipinski’s guidelines and a positive result for any of the selected toxicological parameters was removed from the in-silico analysis. Overall, only eight phytocompounds from both B. monnieri extracts were filtered following Lipinski’s rules and, without exhibiting any kind of toxicity, are listed in Table 6. Molecular docking was performed to assess the anticancer potential of these selected phytocompounds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t006 Among selected compounds of B. monnieri, Spiro[(tricyclo[6.2.2.0(2,7)]dodeca-5,9- diene)-4,1’-cyclobutane]-11,2’-dione, 1,3,3,5,12,12-hexamethyl (compound A) screened from ethanol extract, followed by caryophyllene oxide (compound B) taken from n-hexane extract exhibited best docking score against anticancer targets as compared to the sorafenib. Selected drug-like compounds with binding affinities (kcal/mol) are shown in Table 7. Among the best-hits of B. monnieri, compound A showed the best binding affinities of −8.1, −8.8, and −7.8 against TGF-βR1, TNF-α, and iNOS as compared to sorafenib. Similarly, compound B exhibited binding affinities of −7.0 kcal/mol for TNF-α, −7.2 kcal/mol for TGF-βR1, and −7.8 kcal/mol for iNOS. This means that both extracts have competent lead compounds for the effective treatment of HCC. The 2-D and 3-D images of top-scorer docked complexes and their molecular interactions are given in Figs. 7 and 8. Overall, the BME extract and its active phytochemicals (compound A) with a multi-targeted approach exhibited higher cytotoxic and antioxidative potential by targeting cancer-causing proteins (TNF-α, TGF-βR1 and iNOS) having established role in initiation and progression of HCC. This may be due to the presence of higher concentrations of total flavonoids, phenols and tannins as observed in BME extract than in BMH extract. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g008 After molecular docking, the lead compounds with high binding affinities with target proteins were selected. The interacting amino acids and their bond lengths implicated in the formation of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds of top-scorer phytochemicals from both extracts are shown in Table 8, Figs 7 and 8. In the flexible environment of protein, hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions are important to establish a stable binding of energetically favorable phytocompounds, which is an important step in identifying the drug lead with improved efficacy. Compound A from the BME extract and compound B from the BMH extract were found to have higher binding affinities towards TNF-α, TGF-βR1, and iNOS. The conformer A formed hydrogen bonds involving the amino acids, including Tyr 151 in TNF-α, Lys 232 in TGF-βR1, and Cys200 in iNOS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t008 Furthermore, the same conformer established hydrophobic interactions with different amino acids: Tyr59, Tyr199 of TNF-α, Lys213, Val219, Lys232, Leu340, Ala350, and Asp351 of TGF-βR1 while Phe369 and Trp463 of iNOS. Moreover, compound B only formed hydrophobic interactions with selected target proteins to show their bioactivity. While this phytocompound established several hydrophobic interactions with amino acids of respective target proteins, such as Leu57, Tyr59, and Tyr119 residues of TNF-α, Lys213, Val219, Leu260 and Leu340 of TGF-βR1, and Leu125, Ala197, Arg199, Phe369, Phe488, Tyr 489 and Tyr491of iNOS. Overall, compound A of the BME extract exhibited a strong bioactivity with high docking scores compared to other extract. It has been found that lead compounds from BME extract may have the potential to be used in anti-HCC drug development. The pharmacokinetic prediction of the best-hit natural chemicals, including compound A from BME extract and compound B from BMH extract, is depicted in Table 9 as computed by pKCSM. According to a review of the relevant literature, the Ames test is crucial for a compound of interest, and its positive result indicates its mutagenicity and is unable to be further processed as a drug. Both compounds were non-mutagenic. The better aqueous solubility (-4.958), absorption in the human intestine (98.074), and Caco-2 permeability (1.52) were shown by compound A than compound B. Higher gastrointestinal absorption was shown by each compound, which is important for oral drug absorption into the human body. It was also anticipated that both drug-like compounds would be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and aid in the management of neurological conditions. Both compounds metabolize CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 during drug metabolism. Similarly, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 were inhibited by both phytocompounds. No substance was predicted to be an inhibitor of herG-I and herG-II, and it was not involved in cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Only compound A is positive for the OCT2-substrate and readily secreted by the kidney. Both phytochemicals had varying total clearance values, with compound A predicted with the value of 0.905 and efficiently eliminated from the body as compared to other compounds (0.445). The maximum tolerated dose observed in humans is -0.488 in compound A and 0.148 in compound B. This means that compound B is well-tolerated in humans before inducing any side effects than compound 1. Moreover, compound B exhibited slightly more oral acute rat toxicity with 1.548, and oral chronic rat toxicity with 1.224 as compared to compound A. Compound A proved slightly more toxic than compound B with low values of 0.743 and 0.574 for T. pyriformis and minnow toxicity. Overall, to enhance the biological activity and stability of phytochemicals as a potential drug, slight modifications in their native structures are necessary. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t009 Due to several contributing variables, including genetics and epigenetics, as well as a dearth of effective treatments, liver cancer has emerged as among the main reasons for cancer mortalities globally [57]. Chemotherapeutic drugs are efficacious for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, but their high toxicity, significant side effects, and long-term drug resistance limit clinical outcomes along with increasing death rates [58]. The resurgence in popularity and dependence on medicinal plants as alternative medicines aims to overcome the deficiencies linked with the use of synthetic chemotherapeutic drugs [59]. Various research evidence was reported to bolster the use of traditional medicinal plants in effective HCC regimens [60]. Natural phytochemicals present in medicinal plant extracts activate antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects, suppressing the signaling pathways responsible for cancer development and promoting mechanisms linked to disease prevention [61]. The interaction of different natural agents with the efficacy of anticancer treatment is well-recognized. Therefore, the current study focuses on alternate natural therapies for the prevention and management of hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, medicinal plants with a wide range of bioactive compounds have become popular in the treatment of several inflammation-induced malignancies. In the present study, BME extract exhibited a higher concentration of TPCs (274.92±3.52 mgGAE/g), TFCs (141.99±4.14 mgQAE/g), and tannins (55.49±4.63 mgTAE/g) as compared to BMH extract. Our results are greater than those of the previously published study on methanolic extract; this discrepancy may be due to changes in plant extract preparation or sample collection methods [62]. The literature revealed that B. monnieri methanolic extract showed a higher concentration of these phytochemicals during phytochemical profiling [23]. Phenolic compounds like polyphenols have many medicinal actions, such as being anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, antiproliferative, and cardioprotective. Flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, and other active metabolites are abundant in plants and have therapeutic properties. These plant-derived active metabolites reduce free radicals and enhance metal chelation [63]. It also protects from severe damage, such as lipid membrane peroxidation, protein deterioration, and DNA mutation brought on by reactive oxygen species [64]. In total, forty-six compounds were screened by GCMS analysis from both extracts of B. monnieri. The identified molecules that have been found are part of the significant class of phytochemicals, which includes triglycerides, fatty acid esters, triterpene, steroids, phytosterol, and straight-chain alcohol, among many others. The major components were hexadecanoic acid,2-methyl-, methyl ester, ethyl linolenate, and trilinolein in BME extract, while in BMH extract was squalene, stigmasterol, 1-monolinoleoyl glycerol trimethylsilyl ether, and many others. Hexadecanoic acid,2-methyl-, was reported to have anticancer activity against the HT-29 cancer cell line [65]. Stigmasterol showed an inhibitory effect by causing cell cycle arrest (G1) in endometrial cancer via suppressing IGF1R/mTOR/Akt pathway [66]. A diverse range of bioactive compounds with anti-tumor properties are also present in both extracts. Our results showed that BME extract exhibited a higher level of concentration-dependent antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals, including DPPH, NO, H2O2, and superoxide anions, than BMH extract, as shown in Fig 2 and Table 4. This may be due to the polarity of ethanol to extract more polar antioxidant phytochemicals, which give better results as compared to other solvents [67]. Similarly, a previous study showed a higher antioxidant activity of methanolic B. monnieri extract using various in-vitro antioxidant assays [68]. The increased antioxidant activity could be the cause of the higher concentration of bioactive secondary metabolites in their respective extracts. The therapeutic potential of pharmacologically significant phytocompounds from BME and BMH extracts requires extensive research. Hence, a previous study linked natural agents and conventional plant-based medicines that are useful in treating liver cancer; however, their investigation was restricted to clinical trials [69]. These natural components employ their anti-tumor effect by activating several anti-proliferative processes but usually induce apoptosis in cancerous cells to halt their growth [70]. In the current study, the cytotoxicity of BME and BMH extracts was concentration-dependent, as observed against HepG2 cells using MTT assay (Fig 3). Different inhibitory responses were observed at varying concentrations (10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) of cisplatin, BME, and BMH extracts. The IC50 values in terms of cytotoxicity are given in Table 5. According to the American Cancer Research Center, a crude extract is considered a potent cytotoxic agent if its IC50 concentration is less than 30 µg/mL [71]. Our results demonstrated that BME extract (IC50: 24.77 µg/mL) was observed to be more pronounced than other extracts. These results agree with other studies in which ethanolic and dichloromethane fractions of B. monnieri showed good cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell lines [72]. Contrary to our research, B. monnieri hexane extract exhibited a better anti-proliferative effect with an IC50 value of 53.0 μg/mL on MCF-7 cells [73]. Our findings demonstrated that a higher percentage of apoptosis was induced by BME extract (58.65%) and cisplatin (58.95%) on HepG2 cells in comparison to BMH extract (48.45%) as depicted in Fig 6. Cisplatin can interfere with the DNA repair mechanism by cross-linking purine bases, leading to DNA damage that ultimately activates apoptotic signaling pathways in cancer cells [74]. These findings agree with the preceding research [75]. This is the first report to show the apoptotic induction of B. monnieri extracts on HepG2 cells. Moreover, the cell viability assessment of both extracts was done by crystal violet assay, and the results are presented in Fig 5. The reduced cell proliferation of HepG2 cells was observed at 36.83%, 44.48%, and 57.32% for BME, BMH, and cisplatin, respectively. In both extracts, BME extract demonstrated noticeable cytotoxicity with lower percentage of viable cells. In 2019, the combined effect of bacopaside I and II, isolated from B. monnieri, effectively decreased the proliferation, invasion, and migration of MDA-MB-231 & BT-474 through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [76]. Thus, it is suggested that a significant number of HepG2 cells undergo apoptotic cell death following treatment with BME extract, and this extract may have the ability to develop into a potent anti-cancer drug. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates that both oxidative stress and inflammation may lead to initiate angiogenesis and cancer progression [77]. Synthetic drug targeting is a monotargeted approach may not be functional due to the complexity of cancer; therefore, the best mode of action is to target several receptors to inhibit cell multiplication. There has been debate that multi-target therapies can mitigate the difficulties caused by acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [78]. The selected natural chemicals undergo docking to overcome these challenges and explore their anticancer potential for better treatment strategies [79]. Before conducting additional experiments, the computational approach assessed the binding affinities of possible drug candidate against target proteins that are associated with disease progression [80]. Phytocompounds may target various deregulated signaling pathways, including NF-кB, PI3K/mTOR, MAPKs, AMPKs, TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin and JNK/STAT3 pathways in various cancers [81]. As we know, the HCC tumor microenvironment is a complex and dynamic system of stromal and immune cells communicating with tumor cells, and novel immunotherapeutics are required to target and manage resistance observed during treatment [82]. Current evidence suggests that TNF-α is an inflammatory mediator with a molecular connection between sustained inflammation and the emergence of several malignancies [83]. Additionally, research demonstrated that elevated TNF-α expression levels were observed in HCC liver tissues, and anti-TNFα treatment may suppress the progression of HCC [84, 85]. TGF-β is significantly enhanced in several malignancies, including HCC. A recent study revealed that inhibition of TGF-β increases the cytotoxic efficacy of therapies by targeting the EGFR [86] while TGF-βR1 is a key receptor for its activation. Another research reported that ginseng extract has an anti-fibrotic impact by downregulating the TGF-βR1 and TGF-β/Smad pathway [87]. Moreover, nitric oxide is excessively expressed in neoplastic lesions, is generated by iNOS during inflammation, and is involved in cancer progression [88]. It has been reported that iNOS is overexpressed in HCC and patients with fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatitis [89]. Dealing with these inflammatory mediators and their underlying pathways in preclinical studies to inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis, may suggest its therapeutic role in treating inflammation-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we selected the target proteins such as TNF-α, TGF-β and iNOS having significant roles in HCC development. In present-day research, the binding energies of selected bioactive phytocompounds against selected target macromolecules are shown in Table 7. Overall, among selected drug-like compounds of both extracts of B. monnieri, the Spiro[(tricyclo[6.2.2.0(2,7)]dodeca-5,9- diene)-4,1’-cyclobutane]-11,2’-dione, 1,3,3,5,12,12-hexamethyl from BME extract exhibited the best-hit score against all target proteins, followed by caryophyllene oxide selected from BMH extract. The present study showed a valuable in-sight into the anticancer potential of BME extract, but further research is needed to explore their effective therapeutics before integrating them into the final product. A selected phytocompound with improved stability, bioavailability, and cell-directed delivery should be investigated in animal models. Subsequently, these compounds undergo clinical trials to verify their toxicity, safety and efficacy profile prior to regulatory authorization. The best-hit compounds of BME extract with significant antiproliferative potential, are selected due to their strong potency in the development of alternative anticancer drugs. In our study, in vitro and in silico approaches were used to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of ethanol and n-hexane extracts of B. monnieri. BME extract was found to be more active in suppressing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress due to the presence of valuable phytochemicals. Furthermore, the in silico attempt further confirmed the multi-targeted anticancer effect of phytochemicals identified in BME extract through the GCMS analysis. However, further investigations are needed at molecular and metabolic levels to explore its therapeutics against liver cancer before the development of novel plant-based drugs. The authors would also like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSP2025R350), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Bitcoin is making headlines again, and for all the right reasons. From Saylor’s Strategy to Asia’s Metaplanet, Bitcoin treasuries are proliferating. At the same time, analysts predict new all-time highs could be mere weeks away. And now, BTC Bull token offers a high-octane way to ride the momentum. Bitcoin is once again proving its staying power, not just as a speculative asset, but as a bona fide treasury reserve tool for major firms. More and more companies are creating their own treasuries, with new companies forming explicitly for that purpose. The wider Bitcoin community is electric. Analysts point out that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a stable store of value, especially amid political uncertainty surrounding U.S. policies. Community sentiment around Bitcoin on sites like CoinMarketCap, Twitter, and Reddit has surged over the past month. While the crypto Fear & Greed index is sitting solidly neutral at 51, that’s mainly because altcoins have lost ground to Bitcoin’s dominance. Some experts are forecasting new all-time highs as early as May. There are many reasons behind the predictions – first-quarter earnings, Trump’s aggressive pro-crypto stance – but one factor in particular is driving discussion. What’s driving the divergence? Bitcoin’s position as an independent asset has never been stronger. Multi-billion-dollar companies are building $BTC treasuries and spending USD to do it. Why? In hopes that $BTC decouples from the broader market and charts its own path upwards, potentially to highs above the previous mark of $104K. The stock market has been mired in uncertainty in the wake of US President Trump’s erratic and abrupt moves. It’s also sent investors scurrying for so-called ‘safe haven’ assets not tied directly to stock market performance. Bitcoin has proved to be the best of the bunch, outperforming everything and lending credence to the apparent decoupling trend. In fact, the old perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation may be giving way to Bitcoin as a hedge against even worse. That would be an ironic development, given crypto’s notorious volatility. In any event, the search for a safe haven is bullish for Bitcoin, but the massive capital inflow also means it’s getting harder for smaller investors to really benefit. BTC Bull says yes. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) provides a unique solution to this challenge. The project is designed to offer leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s gains without the complexities of margin trading or futures contracts. $BTCBULL offers strategic token burns and key airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches critical price points. Each milestone triggers a response by the protocol, designed to tie $BTC and $BTCBULL’s price growth together. The combination of token burns + $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops gives token holders three ways to earn: Stack BTC Bull’s three ways to earn on top of Bitcoin’s natural price potential, and it’s no wonder that the BTC Bull presale has already passed the $5M mark. Check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull token, and see why we think the token price can reach $0.00835 from its current price of $0.002485 by the end of the year. Visit the BTC Bull token presale. Bitcoin’s growing perception as a safe haven and institutional reserve asset aligns perfectly with $BTCBULL’s value proposition. With memecoin fervor high and traders continuing to chase gains, projects like Bitcoin Bull are uniquely positioned to capture both mainstream and crypto-native attention.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

Title: Expect to Pay More for These Groceries Because of Tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-28T13:21:00Z

We asked an an expert about which groceries will become more expensive or hard to find as a result of President Trump's tariffs and ongoing trade war. Grocery inflation may rise even further when the tariffs go back into effect. The scope of President Donald Trump's trade war changes by the day. Beyond sending the stock market into disarray and consumer confidence plummeting to 1980s levels, the tariffs are expected to increase inflation to historic highs, particularly in key sectors that center on imports. The global food supply chain is complex, but groceries will be affected by tariffs in a specific way. Due to the climate, some foods, such as coffee and bananas, simply can't be grown en masse in the US. Just last week, Trump threatened new tariffs on countries that don't comply with his trade demands. China, the recipient of the most aggressive tariffs and the US's third largest trading partner shows no signs of concession. Trump also claimed in an interview with Time to have made 200 deals though, notably, none have been publicly announced. On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. One week later as the tariffs were set to go into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. On April 9, just hours after Trump announced a 90-day pause, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for shoppers in the US. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the EU -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are. Read more: These Fast Food Chains Hiked Their Prices the Most Last Year The tariffs may cause supply issues that lead to empty shelves and fewer options for shoppers. This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Adding guac to a burrito bowl may become even pricier in 2025. Many of the avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. Much of the fruit we buy at the supermarket is imported from countries subject to tariffs both now and when the 90-day pause goes back into effect. Canadian whiskey has already been subjected to tariffs. Wine imported from Europe and liquor that comes from Canada, Mexico and parts of Asia are expected to jump in cost as tariffs continue to roll out. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Good morning. A software engineer who has worked at Google and Meta compared their cultures, promotion processes, and workloads. Interestingly, the more stressful company was their favourite to work at. In today's big story, Donald Trump went after one of America's top law firms. Its decision to fight back took just two hours. What's on deck Markets: Early Tesla investor Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its latest earnings. Tech: Microsoft is trying to simplify its AI sales pitch, slides obtained by BI reveal. Business: Your favorite Amazon products are about to get more expensive. But first, Trump is outgunned in court. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. An "existential crisis" is how Paul Weiss' chairman, Brad Karp, described it. President Donald Trump's slew of executive orders targeting high-profile law firms triggered a fight-or-flight response. Nine law firms took flight and struck deals with the president — Paul Weiss included — collectively promising $940 million in pro bono work for the administration. Four — Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Susman Godfrey — opted to fight the administration in court. And they're winning. They've argued that the executive orders violate the Constitution, illegally target people and companies for their speech, and violate their clients' right to counsel. In a hearing on April 23, US District Judge Beryl Howell appeared incredulous at the government's arguments. She directed a barrage of often sarcastic questions at Richard Lawson, a Justice Department lawyer, brushing aside some of his positions as "hyper-technical legal arguments that may have no merit." On the docket, meanwhile, the administration is outgunned. The firms suing the government are working with legal heavyweights. Perkins Coie picked Williams & Connolly; Cooley LLP is representing Jenner & Block; Paul Clement is representing WilmerHale; and Susman Godfrey hired Munger Tolles. "You're a bit outmanned here," a judge quipped at Lawson when he showed up alone to a hearing in Susman Godfrey's case earlier this month. Inside the decision to fight back. In a memo to staff, Karp justified Paul Weiss' move to cut a deal with Trump by saying that leadership had "incredibly difficult decisions" to make. For Susman Godfrey, the way forward was clear. No one at the firm spoke with the White House about cutting a deal, according to two people familiar with the matter. BI's Jack Newsham and Jacob Shamsian have exclusive reporting about how Susman Godfrey decided to sue the Trump administration in just two hours. 1. Ross Gerber's not feeling too hot about Tesla. Though investors cheered Elon Musk's impending DOGE departure, Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its earnings call. Even with Musk back at the helm, Gerber doubts the EV maker can mount a comeback. 2. America is dangerously close to the worst kind of recession. The country's on the verge of stagflation, a condition in which inflation is taking off at the same time as the job market is getting weaker. It's a rock-and-a-hard place situation for the Fed, and leaves investors in a pickle. 3. There are also signs, however, that investors might be able to take a breath. The stock market has flashed a handful of technical signals that suggest the tariff-induced sell-off that kicked off earlier this month may be over. 1. Microsoft cleans up its AI sales pitch. The software giant is trying to streamline how it pitches its many different AI tools — which are all called Copilot — to customers, according to internal presentation slides viewed by BI. The current approach confused customers and slowed sales, insiders said. 2. The manpower driving Tesla's robotaxi launch. The EV maker aims to roll out robotaxis in Austin this June. To prepare, about 300 test operators have been navigating the city's streets over the past few months. Here's what insiders had to say on "Project Rodeo." 3. Everybody talks (too much). Group chat overload has produced a new-old solution: the rise of voice memos. It's part of a broader trend toward speaking over texting for more personal communication. Not everyone's thrilled, though — especially when the calls happen in public. 1. Price hikes are hitting your favorite Amazon products. Some of the site's most popular items are getting pricier amid tariff news, according to data from SmartScout. Some products have even reached record highs, and it's not just an issue for customers. 2. Uber's CEO says your ride could cost less in a recession. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing service is "recession-resistant" and could even make rides cheaper in a downturn — if more people sign up to be drivers, bringing labor costs down. 3. What do Delta, Thermo Fisher, and Chipotle have in common? They are among the companies lowering or ditching their guidance as tariff chaos mounts. Here's the full list of companies on edge.

U.S. stocks were on track for a flat to slightly lower open Monday as investors geared up for a jam-packed week of earnings spanning pizza chains, semiconductor makers, and sanitation giants. Here are the stocks likely to dominate today’s headlines: Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificial intelligence chip designed to challenge some of Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.35%) top offerings, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Ascend 910D represents a major step in China’s push to build a self-sufficient tech industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia shares fell about 1.5% in premarket trading following the report. Domino’s beat earnings expectations but missed on revenue, posting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. CEO Russell Weiner said the company is staying focused on “controlling what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” while celebrating early progress under its “Hungry for MORE” five-year plan. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5%, while international same-store sales rose 3.7% excluding currency impacts. Domino’s stock slipped roughly 2% before the bell. Waste Management (WM-0.11%) will report after the close, with investors zeroing in on margin trends and pricing power. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-6.75%) is expected to offer an early read on global chip demand, where a year-over-year earnings decline is projected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+5.68%) could provide a key window into how much R&D spending chipmakers are sustaining in a tighter environment. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V+1.21%), Coca-Cola (KO+0.78%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.25%), and Novartis (NVS+0.99%). Later in the week, Microsoft (MSFT+0.74%) and Meta (META+0.81%) are set to headline earnings after the bell Wednesday, offering critical updates on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital advertising trends. Amazon (AMZN-0.15%) and Apple (AAPL+0.52%) follow on Thursday, with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.45%) closing out the week on Friday — wrapping up one of the busiest earnings stretches of the year. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies’ leadership mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism falling to its lowest ratio since 2008. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Scrapling - An Undetectable, Powerful, Flexible, High-Performance Python Library That Makes Web Scraping Simple And Easy Again!

KitPloit - leading source of Security Tools, Hacking Tools, CyberSecurity and Network Security ☣ Dealing with failing web scrapers due to anti-bot protections or website changes? Meet Scrapling. Scrapling is a high-performance, intelligent web scraping library for Python that automatically adapts to website changes while significantly outperforming popular alternatives. For both beginners and experts, Scrapling provides powerful features while maintaining simplicity. To keep it simple, all methods can be chained on top of each other! Scrapling isn't just powerful - it's also blazing fast. Scrapling implements many best practices, design patterns, and numerous optimizations to save fractions of seconds. All of that while focusing exclusively on parsing HTML documents. Here are benchmarks comparing Scrapling to popular Python libraries in two tests. As you see, Scrapling is on par with Scrapy and slightly faster than Lxml which both libraries are built on top of. These are the closest results to Scrapling. PyQuery is also built on top of Lxml but still, Scrapling is 4 times faster. Scrapling can find elements with more methods and it returns full element Adaptor objects not only the text like AutoScraper. So, to make this test fair, both libraries will extract an element with text, find similar elements, and then extract the text content for all of them. As you see, Scrapling is still 4.5 times faster at the same task. All benchmarks' results are an average of 100 runs. See our benchmarks.py for methodology and to run your comparisons. Scrapling is a breeze to get started with; Starting from version 0.2.9, we require at least Python 3.9 to work. Then run this command to install browsers' dependencies needed to use Fetcher classes If you have any installation issues, please open an issue. Fetchers are interfaces built on top of other libraries with added features that do requests or fetch pages for you in a single request fashion and then return an Adaptor object. This feature was introduced because the only option we had before was to fetch the page as you wanted it, then pass it manually to the Adaptor class to create an Adaptor instance and start playing around with the page. You might be slightly confused by now so let me clear things up. All fetcher-type classes are imported in the same way All of them can take these initialization arguments: auto_match, huge_tree, keep_comments, keep_cdata, storage, and storage_args, which are the same ones you give to the Adaptor class. If you don't want to pass arguments to the generated Adaptor object and want to use the default values, you can use this import instead for cleaner code: then use it right away without initializing like: Also, the Response object returned from all fetchers is the same as the Adaptor object except it has these added attributes: status, reason, cookies, headers, history, and request_headers. All cookies, headers, and request_headers are always of type dictionary. [!NOTE] The auto_match argument is enabled by default which is the one you should care about the most as you will see later. This class is built on top of httpx with additional configuration options, here you can do GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. For all methods, you have stealthy_headers which makes Fetcher create and use real browser's headers then create a referer header as if this request came from Google's search of this URL's domain. It's enabled by default. You can also set the number of retries with the argument retries for all methods and this will make httpx retry requests if it failed for any reason. The default number of retries for all Fetcher methods is 3. Hence: All headers generated by stealthy_headers argument can be overwritten by you through the headers argument You can route all traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a proxy for any of these methods in this format http://username:password@localhost:8030 For Async requests, you will just replace the import like below: This class is built on top of Camoufox, bypassing most anti-bot protections by default. Scrapling adds extra layers of flavors and configurations to increase performance and undetectability even further. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! This class is built on top of Playwright which currently provides 4 main run options but they can be mixed as you want. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) Using this Fetcher class, you can make requests with: 1) Vanilla Playwright without any modifications other than the ones you chose. 2) Stealthy Playwright with the stealth mode I wrote for it. It's still a WIP but it bypasses many online tests like Sannysoft's. Some of the things this fetcher's stealth mode does include: * Patching the CDP runtime fingerprint. * Mimics some of the real browsers' properties by injecting several JS files and using custom options. * Using custom flags on launch to hide Playwright even more and make it faster. * Generates real browser's headers of the same type and same user OS then append it to the request's headers. 3) Real browsers by passing the real_chrome argument or the CDP URL of your browser to be controlled by the Fetcher and most of the options can be enabled on it. 4) NSTBrowser's docker browserless option by passing the CDP URL and enabling nstbrowser_mode option. Hence using the real_chrome argument requires that you have Chrome browser installed on your device Add that to a lot of controlling/hiding options as you will see in the arguments list below. This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! If your case needs more than the element's parent, you can iterate over the whole ancestors' tree of any element like below You can search for a specific ancestor of an element that satisfies a function, all you need to do is to pass a function that takes an Adaptor object as an argument and return True if the condition satisfies or False otherwise like below: You can select elements by their text content in multiple ways, here's a full example on another website: Find all elements that are similar to the current element in location and attributes To increase the complexity a little bit, let's say we want to get all books' data using that element as a starting point for some reason The documentation will provide more advanced examples. Let's say you are scraping a page with a structure like this: And you want to scrape the first product, the one with the p1 ID. You will probably write a selector like this When website owners implement structural changes like The selector will no longer function and your code needs maintenance. That's where Scrapling's auto-matching feature comes into play. How does the auto-matching work? Check the FAQs section for that and other possible issues while auto-matching. Let's use a real website as an example and use one of the fetchers to fetch its source. To do this we need to find a website that will change its design/structure soon, take a copy of its source then wait for the website to make the change. Of course, that's nearly impossible to know unless I know the website's owner but that will make it a staged test haha. To solve this issue, I will use The Web Archive's Wayback Machine. Here is a copy of StackOverFlow's website in 2010, pretty old huh?Let's test if the automatch feature can extract the same button in the old design from 2010 and the current design using the same selector :) If I want to extract the Questions button from the old design I can use a selector like this #hmenus > div:nth-child(1) > ul > li:nth-child(1) > a This selector is too specific because it was generated by Google Chrome. Now let's test the same selector in both versions Note that I used a new argument called automatch_domain, this is because for Scrapling these are two different URLs, not the website so it isolates their data. To tell Scrapling they are the same website, we then pass the domain we want to use for saving auto-match data for them both so Scrapling doesn't isolate them. In a real-world scenario, the code will be the same except it will use the same URL for both requests so you won't need to use the automatch_domain argument. This is the closest example I can give to real-world cases so I hope it didn't confuse you :) Notes: 1. For the two examples above I used one time the Adaptor class and the second time the Fetcher class just to show you that you can create the Adaptor object by yourself if you have the source or fetch the source using any Fetcher class then it will create the Adaptor object for you. 2. Passing the auto_save argument with the auto_match argument set to False while initializing the Adaptor/Fetcher object will only result in ignoring the auto_save argument value and the following warning message text Argument `auto_save` will be ignored because `auto_match` wasn't enabled on initialization. Check docs for more info. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created/connected only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. Same case with the auto_match argument. Inspired by BeautifulSoup's find_all function you can find elements by using find_all/find methods. Both methods can take multiple types of filters and return all elements in the pages that all these filters apply to. So the way it works is after collecting all passed arguments and keywords, each filter passes its results to the following filter in a waterfall-like filtering system. It filters all elements in the current page/element in the following order: Note: The filtering process always starts from the first filter it finds in the filtering order above so if no tag name(s) are passed but attributes are passed, the process starts from that layer and so on. But the order in which you pass the arguments doesn't matter. Examples to clear any confusion :) Here's what else you can do with Scrapling: Saving and retrieving elements manually to auto-match them outside the css and the xpath methods but you have to set the identifier by yourself. To save an element to the database: python >>> element = page.find_by_text('Tipping the Velvet', first_match=True) >>> page.save(element, 'my_special_element') if you want to keep it as lxml.etree object, leave the adaptor_type argument python >>> page.relocate(element_dict) [<Element a at 0x105a2a7b0>] Filtering results based on a function Doing operations on element content is the same as scrapy python quote.re(r'regex_pattern') # Get all strings (TextHandlers) that match the regex pattern quote.re_first(r'regex_pattern') # Get the first string (TextHandler) only quote.json() # If the content text is jsonable, then convert it to json using `orjson` which is 10x faster than the standard json library and provides more options except that you can do more with them like python quote.re( r'regex_pattern', replace_entities=True, # Character entity references are replaced by their corresponding character clean_match=True, # This will ignore all whitespaces and consecutive spaces while matching case_sensitive= False, # Set the regex to ignore letters case while compiling it ) Hence all of these methods are methods from the TextHandler within that contains the text content so the same can be done directly if you call the .text property or equivalent selector function. Doing operations on the text content itself includes Sort all characters in the string as if it were a list and return the new string python quote.sort(reverse=False) To be clear, TextHandler is a sub-class of Python's str so all normal operations/methods that work with Python strings will work with it. Any element's attributes are not exactly a dictionary but a sub-class of mapping called AttributesHandler that's read-only so it's faster and string values returned are actually TextHandler objects so all operations above can be done on them, standard dictionary operations that don't modify the data, and more :) Scrapling is under active development so expect many more features coming soon :) There are a lot of deep details skipped here to make this as short as possible so to take a deep dive, head to the docs section. I will try to keep it updated as possible and add complex examples. There I will explain points like how to write your storage system, write spiders that don't depend on selectors at all, and more... Note that implementing your storage system can be complex as there are some strict rules such as inheriting from the same abstract class, following the singleton design pattern used in other classes, and more. So make sure to read the docs first. [!IMPORTANT] A website is needed to provide detailed library documentation. I'm trying to rush creating the website, researching new ideas, and adding more features/tests/benchmarks but time is tight with too many spinning plates between work, personal life, and working on Scrapling. I have been working on Scrapling for months for free after all. If you like Scrapling and want it to keep improving then this is a friendly reminder that you can help by supporting me through the sponsor button. This section addresses common questions about Scrapling, please read this section before opening an issue. Now because everything about the element can be changed or removed, nothing from the element can be used as a unique identifier for the database. To solve this issue, I made the storage system rely on two things: Together both are used to retrieve the element's unique properties from the database later. 4. Now later when you enable the auto_match parameter for both the Adaptor instance and the method call. The element properties are retrieved and Scrapling loops over all elements in the page and compares each one's unique properties to the unique properties we already have for this element and a score is calculated for each one. 5. Comparing elements is not exact but more about finding how similar these values are, so everything is taken into consideration, even the values' order, like the order in which the element class names were written before and the order in which the same element class names are written now. 6. The score for each element is stored in the table, and the element(s) with the highest combined similarity scores are returned. Not a big problem as it depends on your usage. The word default will be used in place of the URL field while saving the element's unique properties. So this will only be an issue if you used the same identifier later for a different website that you didn't pass the URL parameter while initializing it as well. The save process will overwrite the previous data and auto-matching uses the latest saved properties only. For each element, Scrapling will extract: - Element tag name, text, attributes (names and values), siblings (tag names only), and path (tag names only). - Element's parent tag name, attributes (names and values), and text. That's because passing the auto_save/auto_match argument without setting auto_match to True while initializing the Adaptor object will only result in ignoring the auto_save/auto_match argument value. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. It could be one of these reasons: 1. No data were saved/stored for this element before. 2. The selector passed is not the one used while storing element data. The solution is simple - Pass the old selector again as an identifier to the method called. - Retrieve the element with the retrieve method using the old selector as identifier then save it again with the save method and the new selector as identifier. - Start using the identifier argument more often if you are planning to use every new selector from now on. 3. The website had some extreme structural changes like a new full design. If this happens a lot with this website, the solution would be to make your code as selector-free as possible using Scrapling features. Pretty much yeah, almost all features you get from BeautifulSoup can be found or achieved in Scrapling one way or another. In fact, if you see there's a feature in bs4 that is missing in Scrapling, please make a feature request from the issues tab to let me know. Of course, you can find elements by text/regex, find similar elements in a more reliable way than AutoScraper, and finally save/retrieve elements manually to use later as the model feature in AutoScraper. I have pulled all top articles about AutoScraper from Google and tested Scrapling against examples in them. In all examples, Scrapling got the same results as AutoScraper in much less time. Yes, Scrapling instances are thread-safe. Each Adaptor instance maintains its state. Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Scrapling. There is a lot to do!

Title: Tariff chaos brews as Big Tech earnings loom

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA+0.35%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ+0.67%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM-0.11%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-6.75%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+5.68%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL+1.40%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP+0.68%) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V+1.21%), Coca-Cola (KO+0.78%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.25%), and Novartis (NVS+0.99%). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes.

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA+0.35%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ+0.67%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM-0.11%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-6.75%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+5.68%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL+1.40%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP+0.68%) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V+1.21%), Coca-Cola (KO+0.78%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.25%), and Novartis (NVS+0.99%). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes. While earnings are projected to come in slightly ahead of last year, investors will be watching closely for any signs of weakness in the outlook — particularly as new tariffs could weigh on consumer spending and international travel. Later this week, Microsoft (MSFT+0.74%) and Meta (META+0.81%) report after the bell Wednesday, giving investors a read on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital ad trends. Amazon (AMZN-0.15%) and Apple (AAPL+0.52%) are on deck Thursday, while Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.45%) is set to follow on Friday, capping one of the biggest earnings weeks of the year.

U.S. stock futures are little changed as markets enter the week on a four-session winning streak and investors prepare for a crowded earnings calendar, including reports from Magnificent Seven firms Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META); Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares are fall in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales; German drug giant Merck KGaA agrees to buy U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) for nearly $4 billion; and shares of Deliveroo soar in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) makes an offer to acquire the British food delivery service. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging lower as investors get ready for a busy week of earnings and economic data amid a four-session winning streak for the major indexes. Nasdaq futures are down 0.1% after the tech-favored index added 6.7% last week, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are slightly lower after gaining last week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade over $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are lower. Gold futures are little changed. More than half of the Magnificent Seven companies are scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) all on this week's calendar. Apple's earnings on Thursday come as the iPhone maker has shed 16% of its value this year on concerns over how U.S. tariffs on China will impact the company. Also reporting on Thursday is Amazon, whose stock was recently downgraded due to its exposure to Chinese tariffs. Microsoft and Meta Platform report Wednesday, with the latter's coming as the Instagram parent faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust court case. Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales. The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's revenue of $1.11 billion was slightly lower than the consensus of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $4.33 came in above estimates. Same-store sales among Domino's U.S. locations fell by 0.5% year-over-year, worse than the 0.22% bump analysts had forecast. Shares of U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) are rising more than 3% in premarket trading after German drug company Merck KGaA said it has struck a deal to buy the firm for around $3.9 billion. Merck said it would offer $47 a share in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based firm. That represents a 26% premium to SpringWorks' 20-day volume-weighted average price of $37.38 on Feb. 7—the day before speculation of a potential deal between the two started, Merck said. SpringWorks shares closed at $44.72 on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Deliveroo shares are jumping 17% in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) offered to buy the British food delivery firm for 180 pence ($2.40) per share. Deliveroo, which said it had received an "indicative proposal" from DoorDash on April 5, added its board indicated to the U.S. company that "should a firm offer be made" at those terms, it "would be minded to recommend such an offer to Deliveroo shareholders." Shares of DoorDash are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: ‘It’s Imminent’—U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this week as traders bet on a recovery of so-called risk assets and ... More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Grayscale’s GBTC is dominating this front – How?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-why-grayscales-gbtc-dominates-on-this-front/
Time Published: 2025-04-28T11:00:20Z

Grayscale’s GBTC tops Bitcoin ETF annual earnings at $268M despite 70% decline in AUM. Despite being the most expensive, Grayscale Bitcoin [BTC] Trust ETF (GBTC) has outpaced the total revenue collected by the rest of the U.S. spot BTC ETFs. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Nate Geraci of ETF Store highlighted that GBTC had an implied revenue of $268 million, compared to $211 million from combined collections by the other 11 products. “Nearly 16 months after spot BTC ETFs launched, GBTC still making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined…And it’s not even close.” Source: X After the debut in January 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC saw the heaviest outflows on what analysts linked to investor flight to cheaper alternatives like BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF. Source: Coinglass Before the debut, GBTC held about 619,000 BTC. Sixteen months later, the GBTC’s holdings dropped to 191,000 BTC, a nearly 70% decline in assets under management (AUM). As shown by Geraci’s data, GBTC charged the highest fees of 1.5% while the rest of the products had an average cost of 0.15%-0.94%. Yet GBTC dominated the overall annual revenue. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, GBTC’s 1.5% fee was considered average in the traditional ETF market. However, other analysts pointed out that most investors were captured in GBTC due to the heavy tax implications of switching to a cheaper alternative. Daniel Sempere, a business coach, stated, “Paying the capital gains to switch out of GBTC is more painful than paying the extra fees, I guess.” Simply put, the high fees and captive tax implications boosted GBTC earnings. However, can the expected approval of in-kind redemption for ETFs affect GBTC’s moat? According to experts, in-kind redemption, using BTC instead of cash, would lower the tax burden, especially for large investors. Despite in-kind redemption being tax-efficient, individual investors sitting on massive unrealized gains will still face capital gains tax. That said, GBTC ranked third on the AUM front with $17.8 billion. The BlackRock iShares BTC ETF topped the AUM list with $54.8 billion, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $18 billion. After the slump in Q1 2025, the spot BTC ETFs saw renewed demand in April, with a whopping $3 billion in inflows. This boosted BTC’s recovery to $94k, up 26% from the year’s low of $74.5k. In the short term, the $92K range low support and $100K overhead mid-range resistance were key levels to watch.

Title: The Case for Higher-Ed “Co-Op” Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/28/2025 3:31:01 AM PDT by karpov Like many students, I waited months after graduation before receiving a job offer. Why this delay for many of the nation’s recent graduates? The answer, in part, is that most “entry-level” positions now require candidates to have one to three years of experience. In fact, roughly 61 percent of entry-level job postings now demand at least three years. How is a fresh graduate supposed to gain experience without years-long internships, which many students don’t pursue? A potential solution to this problem is for universities to adopt the “co-op” or cooperative model, in which students alternate between working for a company and attending classes. Through the co-op model, students are given the opportunity to spend some semesters working for a company and others in class. A student applies to a co-op program at a large, respected corporation, such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Exelon, Comcast, and others, and then interviews as if he or she were applying for a real job or internship. Once accepted, he or she begins working at that company at a predetermined time in the academic year. This model not only provides students with valuable work experience before graduation, but it also helps them build a network of professional contacts who can help them find future opportunities. Let’s consider two of the schools in the top 100 according to U.S. News: Drexel University in Philadelphia, ranked 86th overall, and North Carolina State University, ranked 58th. As of this writing, Drexel, at which more than 94 percent of undergraduates participate in a co-op program, places 97 percent of its business students in jobs (or graduate school) within the first year after graduation. Sixty-one percent of all graduates have at least one job offer upon graduation. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

Otherwise, the co-op program should be optional. Co-ops are similar to internships, and I have personal knowledge of what’s happening now with internships: People thought college students should graduate with experience. So, many universities (maybe all of them?) now require all students to complete an internship before they can graduate. The problem is, the universities don’t place the students. It’s up to the students to find the internship, and it must be one approved by the university. As a result, some students are being denied degrees, even after they finished all their course work, because they can’t find an internship that’s acceptable to the college and will hire them. 14 posted on 04/29/2025 5:30:01 AM PDT by Tired of Taxes [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

A potential solution to this problem is for universities to adopt the “co-op” or cooperative model, in which students alternate between working for a company and attending classes. Through the co-op model, students are given the opportunity to spend some semesters working for a company and others in class. A student applies to a co-op program at a large, respected corporation, such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Exelon, Comcast, and others, and then interviews as if he or she were applying for a real job or internship. Once accepted, he or she begins working at that company at a predetermined time in the academic year. This model not only provides students with valuable work experience before graduation, but it also helps them build a network of professional contacts who can help them find future opportunities. Let’s consider two of the schools in the top 100 according to U.S. News: Drexel University in Philadelphia, ranked 86th overall, and North Carolina State University, ranked 58th. As of this writing, Drexel, at which more than 94 percent of undergraduates participate in a co-op program, places 97 percent of its business students in jobs (or graduate school) within the first year after graduation. Sixty-one percent of all graduates have at least one job offer upon graduation. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

Academia will scream, we’re an institution of higher learning, not a trade school. Because the students will see the real world, and not the BS that’s being shoveled. I got my BSEE from Northeastern in Boston in the early ‘70s. NU had a coop program for the bachelor degree, 5 years working half time. This included a regular summer semester. I worked for three companies which let me decide which industry best matched my interests. I settled on semiconductor. Had a regular job with that company immediately upon graduation and I stuck with that sector for my whole career. How many internships last “years-long”? But colleges like Northeastern have had such programs for decades to great success. Nothing new here. My undergrad school (Rochester Institute of Technology) required 2 quarters of co-op to graduate. I graduated in 1985. I didn’t go through a co-op program, but I was fortunate enough to get a part-time job as a field technician in my industry while I was still an undergraduate. Within two months my employer convinced me to work on a nearly full-time basis and finish school in the evening program. It took me 6+ years to finish my undergraduate degree, but it was absolutely worth it. A month after I graduated, I had one of my former classmates — who graduated on the same day as me — working for me. BME, cooperative plan here. Worked 6 quarters, which was required to get a co-op plan degree. Worked in the industry of my coop job for about 15 years. I’d require colleges to co-sign student loan guaranties. Vo-Tec makes a comeback.....who do they want to pay the companies to allow students desk space? My ex and I did co-ops back in the 1980s with IBM.

Title: The reality of today's tech industry: layoffs, long hours, AI threats, and few perks
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107700-reality-today-tech-industry-layoffs-long-hours-ai.html

In a nutshell: It had long been said that a career in tech was the ultimate dream: high salaries, security, and a huge number of perks made for some very happy workers. But things look quite different today. The tech world has seen the highest number of layoffs of any private sector industry this year; perks have been cut; salaries aren't increasing in line with the extra demands; and there's the constant spectre of AI. As parodied in the brilliant TV show 'Silicon Valley', there was a time when some tech employees were paid fortunes to do almost nothing in their jobs. Their enviable situation was still being reported a couple of years ago, when companies were flush with cash and had hired extra workers during the pandemic boom. Now, we're faced with almost weekly headlines about tech's massive job cuts. Intel recently confirmed it is making layoffs that could impact 20,000+ people. Meta has cut 5% of its workforce in performance-based layoffs, something that Microsoft is also doing. Then there's Google, which this year has offered voluntary exit plans for some staff. Overall, more than 50,000 people from 100 tech companies have been laid off in 2025 so far. Google cut back on employee fitness classes in 2023 Beyond the layoffs, more tech-industry perks are disappearing. Working from home is becoming a taboo subject as more firms drag employees back into the office: Intel is increasing its three-day in-office mandate to four days, while Google has told many remote workers to return to physical locations or face termination. The Wall Street Journal notes that good pay is still prevalent among Silicon Valley companies, though AI experts are seeing their wages rise faster than anyone else. But firms have become obsessed with delivering the results that Wall Street analysts expect, and a lot of the revenue they bring in now goes toward AI infrastructure rather than universal wage boosts. Employees are also expected to work longer to stay competitive – Google co-founder Sergey Brin thinks 60 hours per week is the perfect amount for peak productivity. Sergey Brin Another problem is that many firms aren't filling the empty roles despite taking on more customers, with mundane day-to-day functions handed over to AI. The WSJ reports on an Amazon Web Services manager who says that he had to return to writing code for the first time in a decade last year as the team that would normally do it wasn't available. The publication reports on a Meta recruiter who was laid off by the social media giant and rehired as a "short-term employee." It means she doesn't get any pay increases, promotions, or stock, and she's responsible for a workload that used to be spread out among several people. Productivity, streamlining, efficiency, and cost cutting are becoming the mantras for tech companies, which some say is being spurred by President Trump and Elon Musk's budget slashing and purging of government agencies. The industry's amazing perks like almost-unlimited amount of leave, free merchandise and, in the case of Meta, free laundry and dry cleaning have gone. Even high-quality food and drink in the cafes is disappearing as companies look to save money at every turn. Will things improve? As the economy starts to look shakier amid the Trump tariffs and the AI obsession shows no signs of slowing down, it's unlikely that the tech world will return to the shining light it once was anytime soon.

Title: Marketing has failed big booze but there’s light at the bottom of the bottle

Advertisement April 28, 2025 | 14 min read Listen to article 4 min Andrew Tindall started his marketing career with seven years in the commercial and marketing teams at Bacardi, Innocent, Brown-Forman, and Diageo. Now working in global marketing effectiveness, he reckons the drinks trade has lost its way. A still from I'd like to buy the world a Coke, where they are holding Guinness instead My marketing career began in the drinks business where I developed three bad habits: I’m a sugary juice fiend, I spend far too much time in the pub, and worst of all, I became a certified drink-marketing-wanker (DMW). We are all one or two friends removed from a DMW. You just have to learn how to spot them: All their friends work in booze marketing or behind bars. They constantly outdo each other’s cool new “hidden” bar, like a liquid cultural capital dick-measuring contest. They have WhatsApp groups to debate ad launches, innovation flops, and gossip about people moves like they actually matter to anyone outside Soho. It is the category-navel-gazing that completely screws a DMW’s objectivity so much so that they start thinking a new hard seltzer or gin launch is genuinely culturally significant. However, good DMWs recognize this and rely on customer data to make decisions instead of just pleasing their mates. I’m now three years DMW clean, having left drinks marketing to work in marketing effectiveness. Sure, I still occasionally swirl a mezcal negroni while chortling at the latest celebrity acquisition, but mostly, I’m out. After working across different categories and markets, I can confidently confirm that the drinks category isn’t what it was. I don’t take any joy in writing this. Ignore what that CSO wrote about me on the back of the toilet cubicle door at the Groucho Club; I always try to keep things positive. Yes, there are some brilliant exceptions, but we must wake up and smell the sambuca. The industry that once produced the best marketers has fallen off the wagon. Marketing has failed big-booze. Big-booze stock prices are drunkenly falling. The top houses are all more than 30% down; one is literally down 79%. Listening to industry folk trying to explain this decline quickly sorts them into four camps: The Lifer: This person holds a golden DMW card, is an expert at boardroom politics and has survived 10+ restructures. They’ll always cite “macroeconomic factors.” The Marketing Non-Believer: Considers marketing a cost and (quite rightly) points out how hard procurement teams have dropped the ball. A good example is the tequila mess, where no one could get enough agave, and now there’s a massive oversupply. Whisky planners forecasting 20 years of barrel aging into the future must be howling. The Clueless: Always the loudest. They claim culture has changed (alcohol has become less relevant), people are trading down to cheaper brands, and revenues are slumping as people leave the category for alternatives. The Minority: Understands marketing’s role, so cringes at The Clueless. Knows proper marketing keeps brands in culture, grows categories through penetration, and allows you to charge a premium. You can usually work out which group someone falls into by asking them why the Coca-Cola share price remains impervious to decline and gets Warren Buffett out of bed in the morning. Not every drink brand and business is guilty, obviously, but it’s worth pondering a few key issues. Advertisement Many spirits ads are incredibly “left-brained.” In Orlando Wood’s seminal work, the IPA books ‘Lemon’ and ‘Look out’, he showed that brands must put on a show with “right-brained” creative features to capture attention and elicit emotion from non-buyers. He was forced to name some “left brain” creative features to prove the point with data. You’ll see a lot of spirits clearly use a lot of these: vacant stares, fast cut scenes, overt voiceovers, abstracted body parts and rational product features. This style of work only speaks to the already aware and interested, and struggles to recruit lighter buyers. Elite-DMW Nick Williamson researched over 200 global booze ads and proved this in his drinks ad how-to guide: Raising The Bar. (Reach out if you want to see that.) Beyond the dependency on rational thinking, many ads from big-booze brands look, smell, and taste the same, be it grading, studios, music, sets, lens flare, and the ever-present Gen Z-esque cast. Honestly, go pick a big-booze business. Watch the latest ads from its various brands. The similarities are uncanny and hilarious. Is this procurement having too much sway? Brand managers rotating between brands? Refusal to hire non-drink marketers? I am not sure the agencies are blame-free here either. I once launched a paid Meta campaign for a whisky brand, a competitor launched something similar on Meta the week after and I shit you not: they’d picked the same music and used the same studio. Also, innovation has been replaced with chasing incremental flavors and slimming down glass bottles at the expense of distinctiveness. Or launching global travel retail “exclusives” that eventually fail and end up in the staff shop. You hear horror stories as stock prices get spicy and trousers get soiled. “We must focus on the core.” I agree; get back to brand building, not incremental flavor BS, while we wind back investment in anything that will pay back in 5+ years. Incubation and brand accelerator budgets have been slashed. And the biggest crime of all: no one has managed to arrest the endless discounting. Some of your favorite spirit brands are sold on offer in grocery 95%+ of the time. I understand grocers need their pound of flesh. I understand shelf space, joint business plans, and how you get activation space. But if you pulled that at a P&G or Unilever brand, the CMO would personally come and drag you from your desk to the front door, no matter how many times you say “revenue growth management”. Saving the largest discounts for Christmas as well is like a florist doing a deal on roses for Valentine’s Day. When did you last buy a case of beer or a bottle of spirit at full price? As one of my DMW mentors always laughs, “Why charge for it when you can give it away?” It’s hard not to rant like this when you care about the industry and brands. And you see friends losing jobs, unable to find new ones. Marketing’s role in society is to turn the wheels of commerce. It’s noble. Without exposing myself as a card-carrying capitalist too much. What really prompted me to bother writing this was re-listening to Tito’s CMO (Taylor Berry) on The CMO podcast. A rare podcast episode that I’ve found myself diving back into multiple times over the past few years. This guy really gets it. It only has six product lines (SKUs). I’ve worked on tiny, tiny brands with hundreds. Tito’s refused to jump on trends but focused on driving its brand power. It found an emotional brand platform and stuck with it over the years while still keeping it creative and interesting. This got me thinking about the green shoots we see in the industry from people who clearly get it, green shoots of marketing hope. There’s the obvious advertising and culture work coming from Guinness, maybe the less obvious, incredibly consistent ‘Do What Moves You’ Bacardi Rum campaign that gets far too little recognition for what it’s managed to do for its market share. White Claw’s creation of a global category should also be studied. The Woodsman whisky’s creation of Barry the Beaver and the results that followed, in a category determined to discuss flavor benefits, is heartwarming. 5-star work in System1’s testing and subsequent market share gobbling. Poretti’s first powerful stake in the ground with their new foxy work is also magnificent. De Kuyper’s purchase of the dormant giant Archer’s Peach Schnapps and investment in a brand refresh and new campaign to turn latent awareness into salience is poised to yield brilliant results. Honestly, Gemma Collins is exactly what this brand needs, even if the bottle refresh went a little too far. Speaking of excellent celeb use, Malibu’s new work with Brian Cox is right-brained AF. Malibu is consistently doing some interesting things to drive brand fame. It has to as rival premium coconut rums pop up left, right and centre. Cox really makes all other drinks ads (a category inherently rooted in friends, fun, and relaxation) look serious, boring, and stuffy. And AU vodka is, by some measures, the fastest growing global brand (not drink brand, brand). I can’t reference any big TV ads because it hasn’t done any. Growth has come from a genuine market orientation that birthed a garish gold bottle, a high-color high-flavor strategy (that changed the category), authentic celeb collabs, and owning where few DMWs have bothered to step foot in - a corner shop. Top-shelf vodka brands are getting shown up by a couple of mates from Swansea. But the brand that should really give us hope is the one that should be the most impressive marketing story of the past decade. Heineken’s Birra Morreti. What a champion of a brand. It's just about to overtake Peroni’s off-trade sales, off the back of the ‘Enjoy Life’s Simple Pleasures’ brand platform, which just hit the System1 database. The second highest scoring beer ad we’ve tested. Cracking work from Lucky Generals as always. It lost volume last year but managed to grow by increasing its price by 11%. You see this in about 3% of IPA case studies and 5% of WARC’s. Bloody brilliant. And its Birra Moretti Sale Di Mare (sea salt) is a great example of fluent innovation (80% familiar, 20% new). It’s not all doom and gloom. Marketers who are smashing it will raise the bar. Let’s just hope everyone gets serious and catches up before the decent ones all go and start marketing toilet roll. The minority must become the majority. Right, all this writing made me thirsty, so I went off to the pub. And not for juice. Email all your complaints about the above here.

Title: Meta Earnings Preview: What To Know About The Stock Before The Upcoming Report

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Catherine Brock covers personal finance and investing. ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. More analysts view Meta's legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. Meta Platforms (META) will report its first-quarter earnings on April 30, 2025. Prep for the report with this review of how the company is doing, what analysts expect and which data points will be most telling in the upcoming Meta stock earnings presentation. Year to date, Meta stock is down almost 9%. The stock reached its 2025 high of $740.91 on February 14, after announcing consensus-beating performance for the fourth quarter and then raising its dividend. As with other tech companies, the recent expansion of the U.S. tariff policy has taken a toll on Meta’s stock price. After U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs on April 2, Meta dipped more than 13% in two trading days. Today, the stock trades for about $547 per share. Prior to this year, Meta stock had been trending up with volatility. The stock gained 67% in 2024 and 194% in 2023 on higher revenue and earnings. Earnings growth was the headlining story in both years: Diluted EPS grew 60% in 2024 and 73% in the year prior. Key components of Meta's first-quarter earnings presentation will include updates on sales, profits, user engagement, ad prices and the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. Meta has beaten analysts’ expectations for revenue and EPS for seven consecutive quarters. The company makes its money selling digital advertising across its network of apps, and demand has been strong. Earnings have benefited from cost-cutting efforts that began in 2023, a period CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the "year of efficiency." Continued strong increases in revenue and EPS demonstrate a good balance between Meta's capital-intensive growth initiatives and operational execution. Family DAP is Meta’s high-level user engagement metric. Family refers to the company's portfolio of applications: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. The DAP metric quantifies how many people log in and access a Meta app in a day. For a company that sells digital ads, family DAP is like inventory. When more people use Meta apps, there are more advertising impressions to sell. Not only that, but advertising demand and effectiveness can rise as the user base grows. This is because a larger user base provides more data and audience targeting options. Meta's family DAP has been increasing for years, but the pace of growth has fluctuated between 4.27% and 15.45% since 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2024, family DAP was 3.35 billion, about 5% higher than the prior-year period. Strength in ad prices indicates good demand. It signals that advertisers are generally happy with the value they’re getting for their ad investment. Alongside a rising inventory of ad impressions, this perception of value is critical for long-term growth. If ads don't deliver results, advertisers will spend their money elsewhere. Average ad price can be a tricky metric for digital advertisers. There are several huge players in this space—Google, Amazon, TikTok and Reddit, to name a few. Each is working to build its audience, which creates a continually expanding supply of advertising opportunities. Demand must grow also to keep advertising rates strong. In 2024, Meta increased its average ad price by 10%. Meta regularly reports what it spends on capital investments, including AI. Total capital expenditures in 2024 was $39.2 billion. CFO Susan Li said the company expects to spend a jaw-dropping $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025. AI represents Meta’s most compelling growth opportunity. The company is developing an open-source large language model called Llama. Morningstar reports that Llama is among the most cost-efficient LLMs available today. Additionally, if Meta can make further cost improvements, Llama has many interesting use cases—from generating effective, customized ad content for advertisers to reducing Meta's application development costs. Given Meta's investment in AI, investors want to see these use cases take shape as transformational and competition-busting business initiatives. Every global company faces macroeconomic risks. Three factors to watch for Meta are consumer spending, the U.S. regulatory environment and the ongoing U.S. trade war with China. A slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. and globally lessens the return potential for digital advertising. Advertisers are likely to limit their advertising budgets in response. Should the U.S. or other major economies fall into recession, Meta would feel the impact as slowing or negative sales growth. Meta is currently defending an antitrust lawsuit brought forth by the Federal Trade Commission. The suit could require the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Congress is also investigating whether Meta collaborated with the Chinese government at the expense of U.S. national security. How far these cases go could define Meta's future. Some outlets report that Zuckerberg has courted President Trump to alleviate his company's legal woes. Time will tell if that strategy proves effective. Wells Fargo analysts estimate that 11% of Meta's revenue comes from China-based advertisers, as quoted by Investing.com. These revenues are at risk under President Trump's new tariff policy that imposes taxes of up to 245% on imported Chinese goods. The tariff costs can be absorbed by Chinese sellers or passed on to U.S. consumers, but either strategy likely limits advertising returns. In its last earnings presentation, Meta shared a first-quarter revenue guidance range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. According to Tradingview.com, analysts expect the company to produce $41.38 billion revenue, near the high end of the guidance. Analysts also expect EPS of $5.24. These numbers represent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 14.4% and EPS growth of 21.3%. Out of 72 analysts, 53 rate Meta a strong buy and 10 rate the company a buy. There are also seven hold ratings, one sell rating and one strong sell rating. Price targets range from $448 to $900, averaging to $710.90, which is about 30% higher than the current Meta stock price. Meta's stock price has declined in April, but this seems more related to the ongoing U.S. tariff saga than a company-specific trend. Many stocks and the S&P 500 have followed the same trajectory. Bottom Line Things to love about Meta right now are its revenue momentum, improving efficiency and exciting AI initiatives. However, the company also has some legal trouble to manage and may face short-term headwinds related to the U.S. economy and the trade war with China. These won’t impact first-quarter results, but investors should pay close attention to leadership's commentary on these topics during the earnings webcast. So far, more analysts view the legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. If that's accurate, now may be the time to scoop up Meta at a good price. Otherwise, see best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas.

Title: What Analysts Think of Amazon Stock Ahead of Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is expected to release first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts bullish on the online retail and tech giant. All 26 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who follow the company rate Amazon's stock as a "buy," with every analyst holding a price target above the stock's current levels. The average price target is around $241, a premium of about 29% to Tuesday's close but down from about $259 ahead of last quarter's report. Amazon is expected to report $155 billion in revenue for the first quarter, up 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $1.75 from $1.46 the same time last year. Amazon shares have declined about 15% since the start of the year, amid a tariff-fueled market sell-off that has hit the Magnificent Seven hard. Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans to keep up with the spending pace of its artificial intelligence rivals. But Wall Street's attention is also focused on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. Amazon stock was downgraded earlier this month by Raymond James analysts who said tariffs on China could hurt Amazon's profit margins and lead to a pullback in advertising revenue from sellers on the platform who rely on Chinese imports. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that they estimate 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, and that roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have "some China exposure" that could affect ad spending plans. UPDATE—April 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change The Week That Was: 2025 04-26 (April 26, 2025)Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org)The Science and Environmental Policy Project Quote of the Week: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.” — James Madison (1788) Number of the Week: Increase of 11ºF by 2100. THIS WEEK:By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a discussion of the National Science Foundation. TWTW continues with a brief discussion of the scientific method and why the US National Climate Assessment does not meet the standards needed for its work to be considered physical science. TWTW considers the high scientific integrity of Roger Pielke, Jr. before criticizing his view that fixing the National Climate Assessment will be easy. TWTW then questions the actual physical science supporting EPA’s Endangerment Finding. It concludes with presenting three interesting articles on diverse subjects. ********************* NSF: The Nation Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports science and engineering in the US. Its counterpart in the medical fields is the National Institute of Health. The NSF’s enacted budget for fiscal year 2024 is $9.06 Billion. The requested 2025 budget is slightly over $10 billion. According to reports, the current request will be cut, and part of its workforce will be cut. On April 24, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan announced that he has resigned. News reports claimed this is proof of the anti-science bias of the current administration. The April 12 TWTW discussed a significant problem in US science funding. The U.S. Global Change Research Program publishes what is considered the nation’s premier report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment (NCA), produced by the consulting firm ICF International. The report is endorsed by 15 government agencies including the National Science Foundation. However, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (2023) is a blatantly political report that omits physical evidence that contradicts its general conclusions that the current warming is unprecedented. Further it contains no physical evidence showing the relationship between increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and increasing temperatures. Yet, it uses the discredited very high emissions scenario to forecast a temperature increase of 11ºF by 2100. The Fifth National Climate Assessment is not physical science but more a follow-up piece on the highly politicized Sixth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly its Synthesis Report (March 2023). The Synthesis Report contains none of the uncertainty expressed in Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis (2021). The US National Climate Assessment should emphasize the uncertainty, not omit it. And the National Science Foundations should not be a party to such a poor report. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy, and Science, Policy, and Evidence. *************** Zero Omissions: Although its origins are far earlier, the scientific method became established during the controversy on an Earth-centered universe or a planetary system with the visible planets orbiting the sun. The great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) insisted that only careful observation over long periods of time can resolve the controversy. In 1572, Brahe observed a new bright star (probably a super nova) that triggered doubt in the old Aristotelian belief that the universe was fixed. Brahe developed a research program with improving the instruments used to observe the planets to determine the paths. After his death his assistant, Johannes Kepler used Brahe’s data to explain that the planetary orbits were not circular but formed an ellipse with the sun as one focus and to develop Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion. This history establishes an important principle in the scientific method; no observations should be omitted. As discussed above, in the reports of the IPCC, particularly the summaries, and in the National Climate Assessment (NCA), important observations are omitted. For example, for 99.9% of Earth’s history, there was no correlation between CO2 and temperature. For the last few glacial periods, CO2 changes have come after temperature changes. Two decades of data collected for measuring the earth’s energy balance reveal that the increase in absorbed heat is primarily due to changes in the earth’s albedo. Thus, these reports are not physical science. They do not use the scientific method. Some defenders of this practice in climate “science” avoid the issue by claiming that their work is based on “first principles” or fundamental concepts or assumptions, sometimes considered self-evident. Alas, first principles tell us about the patterns of spectra of molecules such as CO2 but cannot tell us precise energy levels. Nor can first principles tell us about the probability of absorbing IR of a certain wavelength. In Quantum Mechanics, first principles can tell us about the spacings of energy levels, but not their amounts. Precise measurements are required. Such issues are omitted in the NCA. Those who argue from the standpoint of first principles are in the realm of metaphysics, thinking about physics, not in the realm of physical physics. In his 1912 book Problems of Philosophy, the logician Betrand Russell has several chapters evaluating the work of Immanuel Kant questioning “Is a priori knowledge possible?” Can we know something by pure logic alone, without experience or observations? This is a philosophical question, not one for physical science based on observations. *************** Misguided Defense of NCA: Roger Pielke, Jr., is a scientist with considerable integrity. He wrote an essay published by the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology titled “Do Not Use the ICAT Hurricane Loss ‘Dataset’: An Opportunity for Course Correction in Climate Science.” Yet Pielke helped develop this dataset. The abstract states: “A fatally flawed time series of U.S. hurricane losses assembled by an insurance company almost a decade ago has found its way into analyses published in the peer-reviewed literature. The flawed time series is based on undocumented modifications to a research-quality dataset that I and my colleagues [sic.] published almost two decades ago. The uncritical use of the time series has led to erroneous conclusions published in the peer-reviewed literature which then were repeated in important climate science assessments. This paper explains the origin of the flawed dataset and demonstrates its many biases. The errors are so obvious and consequential that papers published in the peer-reviewed literature that rely on the flawed dataset should be retracted. While mistakes happen in science, what matters more is what we in the community do when mistakes are discovered.” Recognizing his considerable integrity, TWTW takes issue with Pielke’s defense of the National Climate Assessment. In a post “Trump Comes for Climate Research: Making sense of the USGCRP and NCA” Pielke writes: “To fix the NCA would not be difficult. Three actions are needed. First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. Second, the report should be led and written by experts chosen by an empaneling team. This team should be selected by a bipartisan group, as is typically done for reports on highly politicized issues. For instance, the majority and minority members of the House Science Committee could each select 6 members of this empaneling committee, with two co-chairs. The empaneling committee would then identify experts to lead and contribute to the report. Third, before the writing starts, the assessment team should query decision makers — federal, state, local, in business and civil society — to identify what information they perceive to be most useful to their decisions related to climate mitigation and adaptation. These three steps would ensure that there is no perception of White House influence on the report, that it is authored by experts assembled in a bipartisan manner and that the topics that the report focuses have direct relevance to decision makers. The NCA is far too important to be politicized, and politicization is a choice. The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and OMG [sic. OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. I do not expect the Trump Administration to take this (very good) advice.” To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. Omission of physical evidence has been a problem for years with the IPCC and the NCA, and with each iteration the problem has been getting worse. The IPCC reports on which the NCA is based have been politicized since “Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment” which Frederick Seitz asserted was the worst abuse of the peer review process he had witnessed in sixty years of American science. The National Climate Assessment is no better. The problem of omission of physical evidence is deeply ingrained, and a generation of scientists have been conditioned to accept it. The reports have become more metaphysics (thinking of physics) and propaganda than physical science. The issue is not trust in “the science” or politicalized scientists, the issue is adherence to the scientific method, a process. If physical evidence is omitted, the work is no longer physical science. Further, Pielke suggests cutting out the White House. The president is elected by the whole people, is accountable to them, and represents their interests. None of the other members of the panel he proposes are elected or accountable to all the people. There is no doubt that the influence of the White House in the past has not conformed to the principles of physical science, but then neither by and large has the pool of “experts” from which the other panel members would presumably be drawn. The only solution is to hold everyone to the principles of science and that can be done only by transparency and freedom of public comment. See links under Seeking a Common Ground. *************** Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding? The National Climate Assessment is claimed to support the EPA’s Endangerment Finding. The EPA’s press release on February 27 states [Boldface in original]: “Action On December 7, 2009, the Administrator signed two distinct findings regarding greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act: These findings do not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities. However, this action was a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and other sectors.” An article in the British medical publication, the Lancet, states: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations”. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? (Note that the dominant greenhouse gas, water vapor, is not mentioned.) The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science. Small corrections are not sufficient. It is wrong. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. *************** Radiation Transfer: In developing a method for estimating the greenhouse effect in today’s atmosphere, William Van Wijngaarden and William Happer use the work of physicist Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916). TWTW came across a 1906 essay by Schwarzschild. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Problems In World Economic Forum? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with: “World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab is under investigation by the organization he created after a new whistleblower letter alleged financial and ethical misconduct by the longtime leader and his wife. The anonymous letter was sent last week to the Forum’s board and raised concerns about the Forum’s governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the Forum’s resources without proper oversight, according to the letter and people familiar with the matter. It included allegations that Klaus Schwab asked junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used Forum funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels. It also alleged that his wife Hilde, a former Forum employee, scheduled “token” Forum-funded meetings in order to justify luxury holiday travel at the organization’s expense. Klaus Schwab in recent days argued against an investigation, telling board members that he denied the unsubstantiated allegations and that he would challenge them in a lawsuit, the people said. The board of trustees decided to open a probe during an emergency meeting on Easter Sunday. Schwab opted to resign immediately as the chairman, instead of staying on for an extended transition period as previously planned.” See Article # 1. *************** Wind Power, Maybe? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with (correction by TWTW): “Germany has invested so many hundreds of billions of euros in its green energy transition over the years that no one can tally the precise amount. Yet the share of wind and solar power in the country’s energy mix in the first quarter of this year managed to fall—by a lot. There’s a lesson for the U.S. here. Renewable sources made up some 47% of electricity consumption in Europe’s largest economy in the first three months of 2024 2025 the energy trade association BDEW reported Thursday. That’s down from 56% in the first three months of 2024. The drop comes despite Germany’s continuing build-out of renewable generation. The country has added 872 wind turbines with a capacity of 4.3 gigawatts since April 2024, yet wind-power output fell 16%. Ouch. You can guess what went wrong. February and March were unusually wind-free, onshore and offshore. A lack of rain meant hydropower underperformed. March was sunnier than usual, which helped to boost solar-electricity output compared to a year earlier. But we’re talking about Germany in March. Relatively short daylight hours in a northern latitude meant this boost wasn’t enough to offset the decline in wind generation. These climactic conditions happen regularly enough that the German language has a word for it: Dunkelflaute, or ‘dark stillness.’ It means renewables alone can’t power an advanced industrial economy, as even Berlin is starting to notice.” Germany is further down the road of free energy from wind and solar than the US. Yet, many US politicians cling to the belief that wind and solar can power a modern economy, especially high-tech that requires reliable electricity. See Article # 2. *************** SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Defensive Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. *************** Increase of 11ºF by 2100. As stated above, the Fifth US National Climate Assessment asserts that under the high emissions scenario, by 2100 temperatures will be 11ºF (6ºC) warmer than today.

May 13, 2025, Virtual registration Why The “Emergency Drought” is No Emergency By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Apr 15, 2025 In summary, the “drought emergency” talk is highly irresponsible and in contradiction to observed facts on the ground. It is used as a tool to scare people, often with unsupported attempts to connect the fictitious “drought” to climate change. Nuclear Scientist Says CO2 Is Not Causing Rising Global Temperatures Scientist Digby Macdonald said politicians need to rethink carefully what they’re doing by condemning CO2. By Keegan Billings, The Epoch Times, Apr 20, 2025 “And the definition of climate is the weather integrated over three months.

Fletcher and Craig B. Smith, Real Clear Energy, Apr 15, 2025 The IPCC’s (International Panel on Climate Change) goal is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C (3.6℉) above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7℉) above pre-industrial levels. The 2°C (3.6℉) limit is a best estimate of the maximum temperature rise beyond which the effects of global warming are unpredictable. It is a judgement call. The IPCC’s 1.5°C (2.7℉) goal was exceeded for the first time in 2024.

Meanwhile, marine heatwaves caused Peruvian anchovies to move away from their usual waters, leading to the closure of commercial fisheries in 2023 and 2024 with estimated losses of $1.4bn.

The crucial line that doesn’t matter By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 For years we were hectored that holding the world to the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C of warming from “pre-industrial times”, a term alarmists use to mean “75 years after the industrial revolution” started not “before there was industry”, was critically crucial in its vital importance. But alas their rhetoric was unpersuasive, their plans were unsound or both, and they admit 1.5 is “out of reach.” So now we’re told that while it was essential it didn’t really matter whereas 2.0°C is like this time for sure man unless it’s not.

[SEPP Comment: The hurricane season may have been costly for the Southeast and Florida, but not one of the most devastating ones in terms of wind speed.

Regions far away from a dot could still face the wrath of a hurricane.) Hurricanes and Tornadoes and Wildfires By Joseph D’Aleo, ICECAP, Apr 22, 2025 http://icecap.us/index.php/go/joes-blog/updates/ Most major hurricanes evah! By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 The second key point is that tropical cyclone landfalls exhibit high variability. And as everybody knows who cares to, the greater the variability, the harder it is to separate noise from signal and the longer the time series you need to develop even medium confidence about a trend. Finally, the notion that major storms are surging proving a crisis and so forth is undermined by the fact that the trend for “Accumulated Cyclonic Energy” or total destructive horribleness of all storms in a year combined seems to be “flat as a pancake”. Here we go again, windstorm edition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 16, 2025 Supposedly it’s spring, despite various local headlines of the “Arctic air will spill into Ontario with possible 15-25 cm of April snow” variety. And with the seasonal upsurge in wind comes the seasonal upsurge in claims that windstorms are proof of man-made climate hysteria. For instance Matthew Wielicki notes that “It’s Tornado Season Again, Again, Again… So can the dreaded CO2 add causing American tornadoes to become less destructive to its list of blessings? Well, no. Statistics are sharp on both edges and the fact that the United States has gone 11 years without a single EF6 event may be a blessing but it’s not a trend.

While the world as a whole was unusually warm during the war years on average, Europe, northern Siberia, and the central North Pacific suffered through three bitterly cold winters from late 1939 to 1942. The Southern Hemisphere was not spared, sea surface temperatures in the southern mid-latitudes were unusually cool and Australia suffered from a very prolonged drought from 1937 to 1945 (Hegerl, Brönnimann, Schurer, & Cowan, 2018).

Not surprisingly, even though there is a wild price spike, farmers in Ghana are leaving the industry, smuggling crops out (because they get a better price). They didn’t plant new trees, they ran out of money for fertilizer, and didn’t try new varieties. Their children don’t want to farm cocoa, and the yields are falling on old sickly plantations.

When the Wind Didn’t Blow in Germany A years-long renewables push leaves the economy hostage to the weather. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, April 25, 2025 Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe A. van Wijngaarden and W. Happer – Using simple thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that the atmosphere of a planet with suﬃciently high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Well, gee. An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection. Maybe the authors live in an alternate universe. Clueless – they are probably delusional enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to the atmosphere makes it hotter. Have people stopped thinking for themselves? Or does this sort of nonsense only occur in the USA? Nobody who contributes to WUWT, not even Michael Flynn, could possibly check the veracity of all the issues raised by this enormously convoluted and over-referenced post. What the hell is it about? I don’t understand the purpose of hosting it. Yours sincerely, Dr Bill Johnston, http://www.bomwatch.com.au ‘An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection.’ Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Please provide a citation from a competent source that explains how such an atmosphere will convect given that it can’t dump heat to space. It would convect in the instance of a surface temperature that varied from one place to another due to day/night, for one thing, latitude, surface slope for more, and so forth. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. The good news is that qualified academics like you and vW&H can differ re. these type of questions, meaning ‘The Science’ really isn’t settled to the point that we should be recklessly messing around with how we obtain energy. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. Don’t guess. Look at Richard Feynman’s lectures, where he says “It is not an isothermal atmosphere”, and how he comes to that conclusion. Observation supports the non-isothermal nature of the atmosphere. As to “what extent”, what has that to do with anything? Are you trying to resile from your previous blanket statements? None of this nonsense is going to back up any silly idea that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Lets’s stick to reality, if you don’t object too much. Both O2 and N2 emit and absorb infrared. Prof John Tyndall established this by experiment more than 150 years ago, and compared the absorption qualities of CO2 and H2O (for example) to dry air, purged of CO2. You can’t show me an experiment that demonstrates that your fantasy represents reality in any way. Next you’ll be telling me that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! ‘Lets’s stick to reality..’ Yes, let’s – show me a bona fide citation that O2 and N2 absorb and emit IR, i..e., show me their emission spectrums if you have any idea what those are. Otherwise, stop being an obnoxious troll who continuously spews nonsense to the delight of climate alarmists. Frank, you probably won’t accept Penn State as “bona fide”, but here’s something from Penn State – While all matter emits radiation at all wavelengths, it does not do so equally. This is where the next radiation law comes in. Wein’s Law states that the wavelength of peak emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting object. So I’ll wait for you to find some matter which does not emit or absorb infrared radiation. I won’t hold my breath waiting. It looks like you overlooked the words “troposphere” and “tropopause” in you criticism of van Wijngaarden and Happer. The Earth’s stratosphere does not have any significant convection, thus falsifying your assertion that “An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection”. Significant atmospheric convection is precluded when an atmosphere develops warmer layers above cooler layers, which can even occur temporarily in Earth’s troposphere under the weather phenomenon known as a “temperature inversion” Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . From the paper – must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Surface to tropopause. You wrote – Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . You are agreeing with me at this point? You have not managed to “falsify” anything I said. An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection. You may play all the silly semantic games you wish, but the presence of “greenhouse gases” is not necessary for convection to occur. Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware. You might read your attachment – “suppresses convection” presupposes convection in the first place. Do you not agree? Or maybe you are claiming that inversions cannot occur without the presence of “greenhouse gases? Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter! “You are agreeing with me at this point? “ No, isn’t that obvious? “An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection.” (repeated claim, to be sure!) No, but I’ll make the falsification of that statement even more obvious . . . see attachment. “Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware.” Humidity plays a significant role in the formation and characteristics of temperature inversions. While inversions are primarily defined by temperature differences between layers, humidity levels can influence the strength and persistence of inversions, particularly near the surface. (Hint for you: humidity is a measure of the average amount of water vapor content in a given parcel of air, and water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) “Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter!” Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. As I sad, greenhouse gases have nothing to do with inversions. CO2 is denser than air, H2O is less dense. You burble that – water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) Strongest? Strength compared to what, precisely? You are on the right track when you say – Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. Indeed. Adding so-called greenhouse gases has no quantifiable effect on temperature. By the way, your AI quote happens to mention that the Moon’s atmosphere lacks the characteristics of a “conventional dense atmosphere” – no mention of lighter H2O, or heavier CO2. Strange, that. Taking all that into account, tell what you think this mythical “greenhouse effect” is supposed to do? “It all depends”? Not much use at all, in that case. “Why Has the Daily Sceptic Been Put on Tortoise Media’s Climate Naughty List?” You do realise what Tortoise media is? James Harding is a co-founder of the slow one, and was…. Director of BBC News and was in the post from August 2013 until January 2018. “James Harding’s slow news outlet Tortoise Media reported a loss of £3.8 million for 2023, down a bit from a loss of £4.6 million the year before. It looks like things might be getting worse… Analysis of internet traffic on SimilarWeb shows a massive drop in Tortoise readership from 465,560 in January to 242,328 in March. A 48% decline… A newsroom insider tells Guido that senior staff are taking their “eye off the ball” and internal numbers also show a circa 50% reduction in podcast listenership. https://order-order.com/2025/04/11/slow-news-tortoise-media-sheds-readers-at-breakneck-speed/ Now, who could the spotty 6th formers at The Guardian flog the Observer off to, to reduce their annual losses? “After the approval by the Scott Trust – which owns the Guardian Media Group – of the sale of the Observer to James Harding’s Tortoise Media last week nerves are far from calming. 125 Guardian and Observer staff have penned a letter – published on the Guardian website – accusing Scott Trust chairman Ole Jacob Sunde of being far from accurate in his claim that the sale of the paper was agreed only after “extensive internal and external consultation.” The staff were having none of it:” https://order-order.com/2024/12/09/guardian-in-meltdown-as-staff-accuse-bosses-of-untruths-over-observer-sale/ A BBC stalwart, of course. Given that the Daily Sceptic is not on message…. it’s on the naughty step. O/T On Thursday this week many local authorities and Mayors are up for election. Needless to say, the car crash known as the Labour party is expected to do rather badly.. Doncaster – Miliband country “Labour’s never been for the working class – they’ve swapped. They’re not the party they were, and that’s why I like Reform. They’re the common-sense party, exactly what we want.” … “I wrote to Ed Miliband and told him about the fuel allowance.” “I got a letter off him, and he said that pensioners have never been as well off. I ripped the letter up, and said I would never vote Labour again.” … “I feel very disappointed in the Labour government,” [she says]. “I thought I’d give Labour a chance again, only to be bitterly disappointed.” “I think that for pensioners and the disabled, [Labour] are really doing a disservice to working class people who have contributed a lot to this country over the years. My trust in them has gone.” Would she contemplate voting Reform as a result? “I think Nigel Farage has some good points: what you see is what you get,” she says, admitting that “Reform or the Conservatives are a better bet for me than Labour at the moment.” https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/27/the-labour-stronghold-that-could-fall-to-reform/ One headline caught my eye…. “Labour Peer Predicts Party Will ‘Get its Head Kicked In’ by Farage over Failure to Address Working Class Concerns”https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/04/27/labour-peer-predicts-party-will-get-its-head-kicked-in-by-farages-reform/ His choice of language makes his feelings on the matter quite clear. It’s thuggish street fighting talk. Football fans even put it into song for the opposition. “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Head Kicked In”, sometimes pluralised to “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Heads Kicked In”, is a football chant originating in England. It is also used, apparently, as a case study in psychology and sociology. He could have said we will get trounced, lose badly etc etc etc. The inference is obvious, low class thugs vote Reform. To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. “To me” that’s a bit unfair to Roger. The copy of the “Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity” … which came with the recommendation that “federal agencies should adopt this definition, incorporate it into their scientific integrity policy, and communicate it to their workforce” … that I came across was for the HHS “federal agency” (direct link) : HHS adopts the following Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity: Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. I think that “the omission of physical evidence” is therefore covered when Roger wrote : The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and [OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. . Any “Real Scientist” (TM) who sees the words “honesty” and “scientific integrity” will also be reminded of Richard Feynman’s public lecture about “cargo-cult science”, which includes : There is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science, it’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.

In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another. not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; Unfortunately, GHE believers are not scientists, as Richard Feynman describes science. Fanatical cultists would seem to be a more appropriate description. They have some bizarre notion that thermometers becoming hotter is not due to increased man-made heat, but rather the outputs of the combustion of hydrocarbons, namely CO2 and H2O. No amount of either, added to air, will make it hotter. Unbelievable gullibility, except that it is widely believed by people who are well educated and highly qualified. It just goes to show that intelligence is no protection against self deception. Roger Pielke did get this one wrong: First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House. ‘ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.’ You need to add provisos to the effect that this statement only holds if the Executive Branch is headed by a Democrat, and that if this condition is not met, oversight and control of these agencies will pass to the Democrat National Committee and/or such assignees as they may name. You need to add provisos . . . Why is that? “ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.” Not true according to Google’s AI bot which outputs the following: “There are federal agencies that operate independently from the Executive Branch, primarily those classified as independent regulatory agencies and some independent agencies within the executive branch. These agencies are not subject to direct presidential control, although they do maintain some form of relationship with the executive branch. “Here’s a more detailed explanation: Independent Regulatory Agencies: These agencies, like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are established by Congress and have the power to make regulations and enforce laws, often without direct presidential oversight. Independent Agencies within the Executive Branch: Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which operate with a degree of independence from the direct control of the President.” {my bold emphasis added} From the Fifth Climate Assessment Report: Somehow, I remain “skeptical,” if by skeptical, I mean gagging on propaganda. The findings in this report are based on a comprehensive review and assessment of information sources determined to meet the standards and documentation required under the Information Quality Act and the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (App. 2), including peer-reviewed literature, other literature, Indigenous Knowledge, other expert and local knowledge, and climate data processed and prepared for authors by NOAA’s Technical Support Unit (TSU; see Guide to the Report section below and App. 3). NCA5 was thoroughly reviewed by Federal Government experts, external experts, and the public multiple times throughout the report development process. An expert external review was performed by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.3 Additional information on the development of this Assessment can be found in Appendix 1: Assessment Development Process. The great genius of the founding fathers was that they didn’t set up one government, they created the federal government as essentially three governments. Each with its own powers. The three branches were set up in opposition to the others, such that no branch could do anything on its own. They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government. To our regret, later generations decided that efficiency was more important, so they tore down many of the walls the founders had set up. As a result, we now have the Beast of Columbia, that rules over all of us with an iron fist. ‘They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government.’ Not true. The original idea was that the people of the sovereign states agreed per ratification of the Constitution to set up a limited federal government. Unfortunately the latter has been highly successful in re-defining ‘limited’ over time, although I think some people are starting to wake up. Under the above article’s subheading of Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding?, the British medical publication the Lancet is quoted as stating: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases ‘threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations’. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” “Science-rooted Endangerment Finding” . . . who are they (both the EPA and the Lancet) kidding? Also, underneath this quote are these statements from the article’s TWTW author(s): “Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? . . .The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science.” Some hard facts to go along with that: Given the current (2025) concentration of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere is only at around 425 ppm, the Lancet, with its asserted focus on human health, should have noted the following regarding ACCEPTABLE levels of CO2 in air that humans breath over very long time periods: — in general indoor environments (homes/bedrooms, offices, theaters, auditoriums . . . all without overcrowding), the typical CO2 level can be up to 800 ppm CO2 — in school classrooms, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers(ASHRAE) recommends that CO2 levels not exceed 1000 ppm — The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that industry workers have an allowable 8-hour time-weighted-average of breathing air not to exceed 5,000 ppm CO2 concentration, and going further stating a “short term” exposure limit in breathing air at 30,000 ppm CO2 is acceptable (note: these are specialized work environments, such as work in confined spaces or near CO2-emitting equipment where such high concentrations may be present) — US Navy submarines routinely operate with allowable concentrations in the their breathable air having up to 11,000 ppm CO2; their maximum, non-emergency upper limit for CO2 concentration is 30,000 ppm (3%); the Navy conducted numerous studies in the 1960’s–1970’s and found that two weeks of continuous breathing of air with CO2 concentrations at 40,000 ppm did not affect performance on multiple tests of cognitive function in physically fit young men — Aboard the International Space Station, the minimum CO2 concentration in the ambient, breathable air is approximately 3,000 ppm, but can reach values greater than 6,500 ppm. The mean concentration is not reduced below 3,000 ppm due to the stations’s limited supply of electrical energy and the capacity of its “air scrubbing” equipment to do such. In addition to the above, when just sitting around humans exhale air having a CO2 concentration in the range of 4–5%, that’s 40,000–50,000 ppm! Yet the EPA Endangement Finding declares CO2 at a value of 850 ppm (the measured atmospheric level back in 2009) threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations??? Obviously, there was no science whatsoever supporting the EPA’s “Finding”. A “bipartisan” commission to repair the NCA, per Roger Pielkie Jr., will probably fix nothing. I point to the example of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (or Simpson–Bowles). Did that do any good?

Title: Parties involved in CK Hutchison's port transaction must not circumvent review process: China's State Administration for Market Regulation

Global Times By Global Times Published: Apr 27, 2025 08:32 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Sunday that it is paying close attention to CK Hutchison's planned sale of its overseas port assets and will conduct a review in accordance with the law, CCTV reported. The regulator emphasized that all parties involved in the transaction must not take any measures to circumvent the review process by any means or implement concentration activities without regulatory approval. Otherwise, legal responsibility will be pursued, CCTV reported. The SAMR's statement came in response to media inquiries following a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report on April 16. The WSJ reported that CK Hutchison plans to split its overseas port asset sale into two separate transactions, as a way to advance the deals. According to the WSJ, the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is considering carving out two Panamanian ports from the $22.8 billion deal to purchase dozens of terminals from CK Hutchison, citing sources familiar with the matter. MSC has reportedly discussed advancing the majority of the acquisition, which involves 41 port terminals across five continents, while resolving disputes over the two Panamanian ports, the WSJ reported. The deal involves collaboration with US asset manager BlackRock and has been structured into two components with different ownership frameworks: one for the Panama ports and another for the remaining assets. Discussions on the two components are moving in parallel, and separating the Panama ports would ultimately require the parties to reach a new agreement, according to the WSJ. The WSJ further noted that the BlackRock-MSC consortium and Hutchison are currently within a 145-day exclusive negotiation period and have not yet signed final agreements. Prior to the report, a spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of SAMR said on March 28 that it would review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei Media and published on the regulator's official website. On March 31, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded to the SAMR's review of the planned port asset sale at a press briefing, stressing that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries' legitimate rights and interests.

GBTC is still "making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined..." Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, stated on X on Sunday. "And it's not even close." The fund generates approximately $268.5 million in annual revenue, with a 1.5% expense ratio applied to $17.9 billion in assets under management, according to Coinglass data. All the other U.S.-Bitcoin ETFs shown by Geraci generate an implied annual revenue of a little over $211.8 million from a total of $89 billion in assets under management. GBTC's revenue dominance persists despite losing more than half its holdings since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January 2024, revealing how fee structures have shaped the fund's economics, regardless of market share. Aside from its first-mover advantage and brand recognition, Grayscale's control over GBTC's management allows it to charge a 1.5% fee. For example, BlackRock's IBIT holds three times more assets, at $56 billion, compared to GBTC's $18 billion, but it generates only about $137 million in revenue with its 0.25% fee. In response, Grayscale launched its Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) in March 2025 primarily to offer a lower-cost alternative to GBTC’s fee, while also diversifying its product lineup amid intensifying competition. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment in 2013 as a private trust, before offering an ETF in January of last year, alongside several other ETF issuers. All this rolled into place after Grayscale won a landmark case against the then-Gensler-led SEC to convert its trust to an ETF. When a trust converts to an ETF, key aspects of its structure change. From a closed-end form, it becomes open-ended, allowing shares to be redeemed based on demand. Because their distribution and transaction costs are different and often lower, the expense ratios for ETFs have been "historically less than those for corresponding mutual funds," the SEC explains. As such, ETFs "can be more tax efficient" because ETF shares are generally redeemable "in-kind," the SEC notes. In April last year, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein claimed that the fees "will come down" as the ETF market matures. The largest single-day outflow for GBTC was recorded on March 19, 2024, totaling $618 million, according to CoinGlass data. At this pace, it could run out of Bitcoin by July 8, though James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Decrypt that its outflows would "slow from here."

Yo, what’s good, crypto fam? It’s your boy Eric Kim, droppin’ the hottest Bitcoin news straight from the X streets, April 28, 2025. Let’s cut through the noise and get to the real talk—Bitcoin’s makin’ moves, and the vibe is straight-up electric. Here’s the top scoop, served with that Kim swagger. 1. Bitcoin ETFs Are Eatin’ Good, Fam! Aight, check this: Bitcoin ETFs are out here flexin’ like nobody’s business. Word on X is that Ark 21Shares scooped up 1,360 BTC worth $116.1 milly on April 21, while ARK Invest dropped a cool $267 milly on Bitcoin. BlackRock? They ain’t slouchin’ either—$84 milly for their spot ETF. That’s big money movin’, y’all, and it’s got the market buzzin’. Posts from @Cointelegraph and @BitcoinMagazine are straight-up hyped, sayin’ this institutional cash is pushin’ Bitcoin toward new highs. With BTC sittin’ pretty at $94K, you know the bulls are runnin’ wild. Eric’s Take: Yo, this ain’t no retail FOMO—this is Wall Street suits stackin’ sats like it’s their day job. When the big dogs like BlackRock and ARK are goin’ all-in, you know Bitcoin’s about to pop off. Keep your eyes peeled, ‘cause this could send us to the moon, fr. 2. Senator McCormick’s Stackin’ BTC, No Cap Hold up, we got a US Senator in the game now! @unusual_whales and @BitcoinMagazine dropped the tea that Senator Dave McCormick copped up to $250K in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF. A politician bettin’ on BTC? That’s wild, fam. X is lit with folks sayin’ this could mean friendlier crypto laws down the road. If the suits in DC are hodlin’, you know Bitcoin’s gettin’ that mainstream glow-up. Eric’s Take: A senator stackin’ sats is straight-up bullish. This ain’t just about one dude’s portfolio—it’s a signal that crypto’s creepin’ into the Capitol. If more politicians jump on the Bitcoin train, we might see some real policy moves. Big W for the crypto crew. 3. Price Predictions Got Us Dreamin’ of Lambos X is poppin’ with price predictions, and they’re lookin’ juicy. @Vivek4real_ is hypin’ Bitwise’s call that Bitcoin could hit $200K, especially if countries start scoopin’ it up. @AltcoinDailyio’s teasin’ a video with end-of-2025 price targets, and you know it’s gonna be wild. Then there’s Michael Saylor, the OG, droppin’ bars on @BitcoinMagazine, sayin’ BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF gonna be the biggest ETF in a decade. With BTC at $94K and that cup-and-handle pattern poppin’ off (@Bitcoinmeraklsi), the chart nerds are losin’ it. Eric’s Take: $200K? Bruh, I’m already picturin’ the Lambo. But for real, these predictions ain’t just hype—big players are backin’ it with cash. Saylor’s callin’ it like he sees it, and when institutions and charts align, you better strap in. We might be lookin’ at six figures real soon. 4. Whales and Institutions Runnin’ the Show Here’s the tea from @HHorsley: Bitcoin’s at $94K, but Google searches for it are mad low. What’s that mean? Retail ain’t drivin’ this pump—it’s the whales and institutions, baby. @whale_alert caught a fat 564 BTC ($53 milly) movin’ from Antpool to Binance, and @Bitcoinmeraklsi’s talkin’ big transfers too. X is sayin’ the big boys are buyin’ while the crowd’s still sleepin’. Eric’s Take: Yo, when the whales are feastin’ and retail’s snoozin’, that’s when you know the smart money’s movin’. These dudes are stackin’ like it’s a cheat code. If you ain’t payin’ attention, you’re missin’ the wave. Time to wake up and get in the game. 5. CZ Droppin’ Truth Bombs on the Ecosystem My man Changpeng Zhao (CZ) got X shook with some real talk. @erhanunall posted that CZ’s sayin’ this bull run is all about Bitcoin ‘cause of them ETFs, but the altcoin season’s gotta pop off for the whole crypto ecosystem to thrive. That’s got folks on X debatin’ whether BTC’s hoggin’ the spotlight or settin’ the stage for the alts. Eric’s Take: CZ’s spittin’ facts. Bitcoin’s the king, no doubt, but the alts need some love too. If we get that altcoin pump, the whole crypto space is gonna be eatin’. Keep an eye on them smaller coins, ‘cause they might be the next to moon. Why This Matters, Fam This ain’t just news—it’s the pulse of the crypto game right now. Bitcoin’s flexin’ with ETF money, political clout, and whale moves, all while the X community’s hypin’ it to the stars. The sentiment? Bullish AF. But don’t get it twisted—@HHorsley’s point about low retail vibes means this is the calm before the storm. When the crowd catches up, it’s gonna be a whole vibe. Eric’s Final Word: Yo, Bitcoin’s out here makin’ power plays while the world’s still tryna catch up. Whether it’s senators, ETFs, or Saylor’s big bets, the game’s changin’. Stack them sats, stay humble, and don’t sleep on this wave. We in the future, fam—let’s ride it. Peace! Key Citations Note: This is written in the energetic, conversational style of Eric Kim, inspired by his YouTube vibe—hype, relatable, and a bit braggadocious, but always keepin’ it real with the crypto community.

Key Points Recent Developments in Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are seeing notable activity, with major financial firms making significant purchases. For instance, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF bought 1,360 BTC worth $116.1 million on April 21, 2025, while ARK Invest purchased Bitcoin worth $267 million, and BlackRock acquired $84 million worth for its spot ETF. These moves highlight growing institutional interest, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price upward. Institutional and Political Interest The involvement of political figures is also noteworthy. US Senator Dave McCormick invested up to $250,000 in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF, suggesting increasing acceptance among policymakers. This could have implications for future regulations and policies affecting Bitcoin. Market Sentiment and Price Predictions Bitcoin is currently trading around $94,000, with analysts predicting it could reach $200,000 or higher, driven by institutional demand and potential country-level adoption. Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, predicted that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF could become the world’s largest ETF within a decade, emphasizing Bitcoin’s long-term potential in traditional finance.

Title: DJT Stock Soars 57% as Trump Media Expands Into Financial Services

ByJoel Shulman ByJoel Shulman, Contributor. Trump Media and Technology Soars 57% in 2 weeks with Support from New Deals with Crypto.com and ... More Yorkville America Digital Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) has delivered a stunning stock market performance in recent weeks. Since April 8, DJT shares have rocketed roughly +57%, making it the #1 stock in the Russell 1000 Growth Index over that period and outperforming the second-best performer by about 10 percentage points. The stock jumped from about $16.66 on April 8 to $26.14 by April 25. Such a meteoric rise evokes memories of meme-stock short squeezes — and indeed, DJT’s past rallies have featured that dynamic — but this time a different force is at work. Rather than a flash-in-the-pan frenzy, the surge in DJT appears driven by ambitious growth moves and strategic partnerships, not just a short squeeze. The company is leveraging its Trump-brand loyal following and expanding into financial services in ways that could signal significant long-term opportunity. DJT stock price surged in April 2025, far outpacing the broader market and its peers. DJT’s recent rally has been nothing short of remarkable. In a span of just over two weeks, the stock price climbed nearly 60%, decisively beating not only the broader market but every other name in the large-cap growth index. Historically, such explosive moves in Trump-linked stocks have often been attributed to technical market mechanics — notably short sellers getting squeezed. Last autumn, for example, Trump Media’s stock saw a triple-digit percentage spike largely due to a classic short squeeze as speculators betting against the company found few shares available to buy back. Donald Trump owns roughly 57% of the company’s stock, a stake unlikely to trade anytime soon, which severely limited the float and turbocharged that squeeze. This time around, however, many analysts agree the primary catalyst isn’t a short squeeze. Yes, there are still skeptics shorting DJT — and with Trump’s large insider ownership, any increase in short interest could quickly become precarious for them. But the current buying pressure is coming from concrete business developments and investor optimism about new revenue streams, rather than a sudden rush of shorts covering positions. In other words, the market is rallying behind DJT’s growth story, not just a trading technicality. A major catalyst is the recent announcement that Yorkville America Digital has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) through the Truth.Fi brand. The initial ETPs are expected to focus on cryptocurrencies, bringing together powerful brands and marketing reach to a fast-growing financial sector. According to public statements, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes described the agreement as a major step in diversifying TMTG into financial services and digital assets. Yorkville America Digital CEO Troy Rillo also emphasized that the new products would align with America-First investment themes and anticipated strong demand from investors once the ETFs launch later this year. This strategic partnership leverages the brand power of TMTG, the financial expertise of Yorkville America Digital, and the technological infrastructure of Crypto.com. It marks a decisive step for TMTG, moving beyond media into the lucrative world of financial products with minimal capital outlay and maximum brand leverage. In recent weeks, there has been a flurry of public announcements from Troy Rillo, CEO of Yorkville America Digital, who has announced deals with Crypto.com, SMA partnerships, and other forthcoming ETF offerings. These moves reflect an ambitious and aggressive push into financial services, offering new product lines that could rapidly generate fee-based revenue streams for Trump Media. For investors, these moves into fintech represent a dramatic broadening of Trump Media’s business model. The company best known for Truth Social and Truth+ streaming is now positioning itself to capture a slice of the booming ETF and crypto investment market. The global ETF market exceeds $10 trillion in assets, so even a small foothold could translate into significant revenue for TMTG via management fees or partnerships. One of the strategic aces up TMTG’s sleeve is the Trump brand itself – and the unusually loyal following that comes with it. In the ultra-competitive world of ETFs and crypto offerings, garnering investor attention is half the battle. Millions of supporters of Donald Trump have a cultural or ideological affinity for his ventures, and that could translate into immediate demand for products like Truth.Fi’s “patriotic” investment funds. This unique audience gives Trump Media a critical distribution and marketing advantage that most new entrants could never replicate. Moreover, Truth Social already attracts many crypto enthusiasts (drawn by pro-freedom, anti-establishment sentiments), and TMTG can cross-promote Truth.Fi products to those users at minimal cost. In a world where dozens of crypto ETFs and hundreds of altcoins compete for attention, a high-profile name like “Trump” attached to an investment vehicle provides instant differentiation. Beyond the brand cachet, Trump Media’s approach to entering new markets is notable for its capital efficiency. Rather than building an entire financial services arm from scratch, TMTG is partnering with established players to do the heavy lifting — while it provides the brand and audience. This kind of model can be extremely high-margin. Essentially, every dollar of revenue generated from, say, an ETF fee or a trading spread on Crypto.com, comes with minimal incremental cost for TMTG. The infrastructure and operational expenses are borne by partners, so Trump Media’s share of the economics is almost pure profit. It’s the concept of an “infinite ROI” — leveraging someone else’s investment to generate returns for your company. A classic analogy is Dell’s strategy: Dell would bundle third-party peripherals (like monitors, printers, and accessories made by other companies) with its computers and sell them to customers. Dell didn’t spend a dime on developing those peripherals, yet it earned a margin on each sale — an essentially infinite return on that portion of the transaction. Trump Media is employing a similar playbook. By partnering with Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com, it can offer financial products under the Truth.Fi brand without bearing the full development cost. Revenues from these products (such as fund management fees or revenue-sharing on trading activity) drop straight to the bottom line for TMTG. Importantly, this strategy also accelerates time-to-market and reduces execution risk. Instead of spending years and tens of millions of dollars building a crypto trading platform or ETF team, TMTG plugged into partners that already have these capabilities. What does all this mean for DJT’s future? In short, substantial potential upside. The company’s core social media business (Truth Social) has yet to prove it can generate massive revenues, but these new financial ventures could open multiple new income streams. If even one of the Truth.Fi ETFs attracts significant assets, it could mean millions in annual fee revenue for TMTG with very little incremental expense. There are virtually endless possibilities for additional financial products (think crypto lending, payments, or co-branded credit cards) that could be introduced leveraging the same partnership-driven model. It’s also worth noting that while this rally isn’t primarily a short squeeze, the ingredients for one are still in place. Donald Trump’s large ownership stake (over half the company) means the effective float of tradable shares is limited, so any surge in demand could send shorts scrambling to cover. By focusing on fundamentals and executing a solid strategy, TMTG could actually set the stage for another short squeeze — rewarding loyal investors even further. With momentum building and a credible growth plan unfolding, DJT is a stock that investors can no longer afford to ignore. Love or hate the politics around it, the company is demonstrating real business initiative — moving aggressively into fintech in a way that monetizes the Trump brand’s unique strengths. The recent 57% surge in the stock’s value is a reflection of that newfound optimism. Could the shares be volatile? Certainly. But the upside scenario — where Truth.Fi and other partnerships add meaningful revenue and earnings — suggests this rally may have more room to run. Moreover, management hints that additional deal announcements are on the way, which could further bolster the bull case. In a market full of growth stocks, DJT has set itself apart at the top of the leaderboard, and it could just be getting started. ------------------------------------ Disclosure Note: past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Title: Google Declared An Illegal Monopoly For The Second Time In A Year, Digital Ad Network Under Fire

Google's ad services are an illegal monopoly, according to a ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema. The decision, which was handed down April 17, is the second antitrust ruling against the company in the last year. In her opinion, the judge ruled that the company's ad business, which matches website publishers with advertisers and determines which banner ads appear on which sites across the web, has violated antitrust law. Don't Miss: "For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets," Brinkema wrote in her 115-page ruling. Continuing, "Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anti-competitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features." According to the Associated Press, the construction of the monopolizing ad system began back in 2008, when Google bought online ad specialist DoubleClick for $3.2 billion. At the time, U.S. regulators approved the purchase. Now, they've realized that move enabled the company to manipulate ad prices. The Justice Department argued that Google controls all three corners of the digital ad market— one side that allows website publishers to sell ad space on their websites, the other is the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of viewers, and the third is the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions that connect buyers and sellers. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling. "Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective," Lee-Anne Mulholand, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs, the media reports. According to the AP, the company's lawyers argued that the government is basing its case on antiquated concepts that were relevant a decade ago, but are no longer a good framework for understanding the highly competitive market for advertising that exists currently. The decision marks the Justice Department's second victory over the tech giant in a year. Last August, US District Judge Amit Mehta, ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly on search. In that ruling, the judge said that the company's exclusive contracts, which secured them the spot as the No. 1 search engine on smartphones and web browsers, violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. And back in 2023, a federal jury found the Google app store to be an illegal monopoly. The cases are expected to play out over the next several years as Google appeals the decisions.

April 27, 2025 15:08 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun BEIJING, April 27 (Reuters) – China’s top market regulator said on Sunday it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s 0001.HK planned sale of most of its ports operations to a BlackRock-led consortium and parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. The sale by the Hong Kong conglomerate, which contains two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicized amid intensifying U.S.-Sino trade tensions. “No concentration of undertakings shall be implemented without approval, otherwise legal liability will be incurred,” the State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement. The statement was in response to a Wall Street Journal article on April 16. The MSC shipping empire, which is part of the BlackRock consortium, has held discussions on moving ahead with the bulk of the deal while disputes over the two Panama ports are resolved, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal has two components with different ownership structures – one for the Panama ports and one for everything else, the report added. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take back the Panama Canal and has hailed the deal as a “reclaiming” of the waterway. Chinese state media, however, have criticized the planned sale as a betrayal of China’s interests. Trump said on Saturday that American military and commercial ships should be allowed to travel through the Panama Canal and Suez Canal free of charge. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison announced last month it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $22.8 billion. Singapore’s PSA International, which owns the other 20%, is also exploring a sale of its holding, sources have said. Overall the Hong Kong conglomerate has interests in 53 ports. Ports in Hong Kong and mainland China were not included in the deal.

Title: What Tech Workforce Changes Could Mean For Opportunistic Family Offices

ByFrancois Botha ByFrancois Botha, Senior Contributor. The Intel headquarters in Santa Clara could end up a ghost town if their planned "de-laboring" ends ... More up being an extensive exercise. The past week’s markets seem confused. Alphabet’s stock price went up after strong earnings, great news for investors, even while the company has significantly reduced jobs. Major tech businesses including Intel and Meta are cutting large numbers of workers. Public interest as seen in Google trends about these changes continues to rise, showing that something deeper than just cost cuts is taking place. These moves point to broader market shifts as companies put more focus on artificial intelligence and reconsider staffing and global trade issues. Family offices investing in public and private technology companies will likely pay close attention. Three critical areas now require their focus: managing investment risk, finding talented people, and discovering new business opportunities. Managing Investment Risk in an Uncertain Market Tech companies today don’t just deal with internal changes like layoffs and cost reductions. Bigger global issues such as tariffs, trade conflicts, and political challenges directly affect the companies’ costs, supply chains, and profits. Family offices, in turn, must now consider these global factors carefully. It's no longer enough to just review a company's quarterly earnings or internal plans. Tariff changes, broken supply chains, and shifting international trade rules must all factor into an investor’s planning. To manage these risks, family offices should carefully evaluate how global issues affect each business they invest in. They should also spread their investments across different markets or industries to lower overall risk and protect against unexpected events. People as Assets, Not Costs: Building Teams for the Future Recent workforce reductions at tech companies have placed many skilled professionals back onto the hiring market. For family offices, this creates fresh opportunity to hire talent for their own teams or for the businesses they support. Many family offices are now operating similarly to technology startup teams. They view finding and hiring talented people as an investment, rather than viewing employees as expenses. Skills related to cyber security, artificial intelligence, digital compliance, and data analysis have become especially valuable. To succeed, family offices must invest in training and developing their teams. They should encourage staff to expand their knowledge and skills and give employees the opportunity to learn new tasks. Family offices can also help the businesses they own in identifying and hiring people with valuable skills who might otherwise be missed. Success won't result from reacting after the fact. It requires thoughtful planning and a commitment to continually build and reshape effective, adaptable teams. Humans and Technology Working Together Recent tech industry adjustments have raised questions about the future role of workers. Many discussions revolve around which tasks humans will continue to perform and which can be handled by artificial intelligence and technology. These discussions shouldn’t focus exclusively on replacing human workers. Instead, effective solutions will involve people and technology working side by side. Human abilities such as judgment, critical thinking, and contextual understanding remain difficult for machines to handle and will remain highly important for years to come. Family offices that understand this reality will hire people whose skills complement technology. Areas such as compliance, ethical considerations, client relationships, and interpretation of data still clearly depend on human understanding. Importantly, family offices should look for team members who are flexible, eager to learn new skills, and open to evolving their roles as technology advances and market needs change. Staying Flexible in a Changing Market The recent tech sector changes signal deeper shifts than ordinary market ups and downs. Family offices risk serious disappointment when they follow trends without careful thought. Instead, successful family offices will focus on thoughtful analysis and maintain patience, remaining ready to quickly adapt to market changes. To navigate successfully, family offices should question popular assumptions and avoid investments driven by hype. They should examine each potential opportunity carefully and clearly. Those who keep an open mind, remain committed to learning, and think independently will be best suited to thrive. Opportunistic family offices can stand out by understanding market conditions thoroughly, thoughtfully building strong teams, effectively pairing human insight with technology, and preparing themselves to respond decisively to change.

Admittedly, to say Apple has something to prove in this week's earnings report smacks of arrogance. But there you have it. Apple (AAPL) , which sports the richest market capitalization of any stock in the world, has seen its stock struggle this year. 💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵 The shares ended flat on Friday at $208.58, up 5.9% for the week, but the longer-term picture is more clouded. The shares are off 6.1% so far in April, and they're down 16.7% for the year, not a pleasant picture when for a company that's reporting fiscal-second quarter profits after Thursday's close. Apple faces a slew of challenges, including: So, the consensus estimates for its fiscal second quarter aren't eye-popping. Stocks, at least late Sunday afternoon, looked to open modestly lower on Monday. Futures trading for the major averages all showed declines. But futures markets don't speak for the live stock market. Futures trading headed into Thursday and Friday suggested weak opens, but the stock managed to rally. Four of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies report earnings this week. Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) report after Wednesday's close. Apple and Amazon.com (AMZN) weigh in after Thursday's finish. But earnings reports will pour out all week from some 900 U.S. companies. Just about every company executive will have to answer questions on their businesses are affected by global and domestic economic forces and the threats they face — if any — from President Trump's tariff proposals. And it's complicated because the Trump Administration keeps changing course. So far, earnings presentations have suggested customers are anxious and spend more time considering purchases.. A shop in Santee Alley in Los Angeles offers clothing on sale as tariffs have affected many California businesses. Genaro Molina/Getty Images The president's tariff proposal caused the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to fall as much as 12.7% between April 2 and a reversal that hit on April 9 when the President said he was suspending most of the tariffs for 90 days. The volatility was exacerbated when the president then indicated he might fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates fast enough. In all, 11 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average are on the calendar, along with 180 S&P 500 members . Besides the four Mag 7 companies, companies reporting include: A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) htis past week in New York City. ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images So far, according to FactSet, the earnings have been a touch better than expected. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was actually quite a bit better than expected. The company reaffirmed its plan to spend $75 billion on new data centers this year. Shares were up 1.8% Friday at $162.20 and are up 4.9% so far in April. They're still down 14.3% this year. Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped Friday after CEO Elon Musk said he expected to spend more time with the company. But, like Alphabet, the shares were still down 42% from their 52-week high reached in December. Earnings fell 71% from a year earlier because of weak demand and growing competition around the world. Plus Musk's activities with the Trump Administration have alienated many traditional Tesla buyers. Tesla shares have fallen 33.7% since Donald Trump's inauguration.

Title: Defunding DEI: Here’s how the Trump administration has undone Biden’s very prized programs

Ohio State Sen. Jerry Cirino weighs in on Democratic opposition on the Buckeye State banning DEI practices at public colleges. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office and signed a number of executive orders to quickly undo former President Joe Biden’s efforts. The president, just hours after taking the Oath of Office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, signed an executive order to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government. He also quickly signed an order making it "the official policy of the U.S. government to only recognize two genders: male and female." WHITE HOUSE OPM ORDERS ALL DEI OFFICES TO BEGIN CLOSING BY END OF DAY WEDNESDAY A day later, the president directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to notify heads of agencies and departments to close all DEI offices and place those government workers in those offices on paid leave. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) That move quickly forced those offices to take down all outward facing media — websites, social media accounts, and more — for those DEI offices, and required the withdrawal of any final pending documents, directives, orders, materials and equity plans. Trump also canceled current and impending contracts focused on DEI initiatives, with Elon Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that move saved the federal government $420 million. The president also issued two other executive actions that day targeting DEI. One was an executive order to end discrimination in the workplace and higher education through race and sex-based preferences under the guise of DEI. The other was a memo to eliminate a Biden administration policy that prioritized DEI hiring at the Federal Aviation Administration. In the memo rolling back Biden's DEI hiring practices at the FAA, Trump ordered the secretary of transportation and FAA administrator to immediately stop Biden's DEI hiring programs and return to nondiscriminatory, merit-based hiring. TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS Trump also required that the FAA administrator review the past performance and performance standards of all agency employees in critical safety positions and make it clear that anyone who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure flight safety and efficiency. A sign marks the entrance to the FAA headquarters in Washington DC on October 7, 2024. (J. David Ake/Getty Images) "Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence," the memo read. The memo stated: "All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication." Trump also rescinded Biden’s order on diversity initiatives, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government," which he signed on his first day in office in 2021. In February, the Department of Education also warned state education departments that they must remove DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. That move came after Trump signed executive orders directing agencies to provide a plan to eliminate federal funding for "illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. A new study revealed that nearly half of U.S. college students don't DEI courses mandated in their schools. (Fox News) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs. Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency’s "Scientific Integrity Policy" implemented during the last few weeks of Biden’s term, to peel back any DEI requirements. That Biden-era policy said that DEI was an "integral" part of "the entire scientific process," and pushed NIH's chief scientist and top scientific integrity official to "promote agency efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion." It also instituted agency-wide policy directives ordering supervisors at the NIH to "support" scientists and researchers who are "asexual" or "intersex," while imploring NIH leadership to "confer with relevant offices" when additional DEI expertise is needed. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI "The Biden administration weaponized NIH’s scientific integrity policy to inject harmful DEI and gender ideology into research," said Health and Human Services Department spokesperson, Andrew Nixon. "Rescinding this (scientific integrity) policy will allow NIH to restore science to its golden standard and protect the integrity of science." The Biden administration also funded grants related to DEI, such as one for roughly $165,000 that was focused on "queering the curriculum" for family medicine doctors to guide them in their treatment of transgender patients. Those grants have been canceled. And earlier this week, multiple federal agencies told Fox News Digital that they have dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services over the business social network’s embrace of DEI. The Departments of Treasury, Interior and Veterans Affairs dropped LinkedIn — a move to comply with the president’s executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies.

"Under the leadership of President Trump, we have been combing through hundreds of thousands of contracts here at the Department alone and are canceling wasteful, woke, and downright ridiculous contracts that do not align with the will of the American people." LinkedIn DEI services (LinkedIn) A LinkedIn spokesperson told Fox News Digital, in response, that: "Like every business, the organizations that use our products change, often driven by shifts in their budgets and priorities. We’re keeping our focus on helping our customers achieve the objectives they’ve set." Fox News Digital's David Spector and Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.

Even before those 50,000 layoffs in 2025, Silicon Valley's Mercury News was citing some interesting statistics from economic research/consulting firm Beacon Economics. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the San Francisco Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs But then in 2023 and 2024 the industry had slashed even more tech jobs -- 80,200 -- for a net loss (over five years) of 5,500. So is there really a cutback in perks and a fear of layoffs that's casting a pall over the industry? share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. Do you agree with the picture that's being painted by the Wall Street Journal? They told their readers that tech workers are now "just like the rest of us: miserable at work."

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Not so long ago, the idea of public tech companies emerging from Latin America seemed far-fetched, and Mercado Libre once appeared as rare and mythical as a true unicorn. Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notably going public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin America demonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that became a super app and expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raised a $1 billion investment from SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to the round of more than $500 million it secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds of layoffs and facing changing gig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans to invest $110 million to boost its operations. However, the company still very much hopes to IPO and hired a CFO to prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities in six Latin American countries and a tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcing a $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 million at a $5.1 billion valuation. With $755 million raised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lender at $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It was extended in July 2022 at the same valuation, allowing Creditas to buy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbank for some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short, “Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the $500 million Series E mega-round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after its Accel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded by Victor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’ $60 million Series A in 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached a nearly $3 billion valuation from its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstage at Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill would replace Lazarte as CEO. It also conducted several rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech company supported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the company at $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conducted two rounds of layoffs in 2022 but denied having raised a down round in November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from a sovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed to have reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raised in April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at $2.28 billion in December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. After increasing its stake in 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had its first-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valued at $8.7 billion after a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuation slashed by $6.5 billion following expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek and QED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with the Chinese facial-recognition software company by the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitability in 2023 and closed 2024 with $497 million in revenue. Briefly known as BlitzPay and founded by former PayPal employees, Clip is the Square of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a $250 million round led by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raised in June 2024 confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEO told Bloomberg. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for its focus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round was a $205 million Series F led by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Bets are still open on who may join the list and how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated. Topics Freelance Reporter Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.

Title: SPAS-12 History Value: Legacy and Rising Price

Time Published: 2025-04-27T14:00:00Z

The SPAS-12 shotgun, with its rich history and significant value, stands as one of the most iconic firearms of its time. Known for its unique design and powerful performance, the SPAS-12’s history and value have only grown over the years, making it a prized collectible for enthusiasts. Check out our video reel showcasing the SPAS-12 in action on Facebook and Instagram: The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) was a combat shotgun manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Initially designed as a law enforcement and military shotgun, the SPAS-12 became iconic due to its unique dual-mode action, allowing it to function as both a semi-automatic and pump-action shotgun. Its distinctive appearance, combined with a folding metal stock, heat shield, and overall aggressive design, contributed to its cult status among firearm enthusiasts, collectors, and Hollywood filmmakers alike. The SPAS-12 was unique in that it was one of the few shotguns designed with a dual-action mode, allowing the user to switch between semi-automatic and pump-action operation. The ability to cycle between these modes gave it a tactical advantage in specific scenarios. In semi-automatic mode, it could rapidly fire shells, while in pump-action mode, it could handle a broader range of ammunition, including lower-powered shells that might not cycle in a gas-operated system. Some other notable features include: Due to its versatility and intimidating appearance, the SPAS-12 was marketed toward military, law enforcement, and civilian buyers, although it was ultimately restricted in many regions due to firearm regulations. In 1994, the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was enacted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Public Law No. 103-322). This legislation restricted the sale and importation of certain firearms based on a set of cosmetic and functional features, rather than their actual operational capabilities. The SPAS-12, with its tactical appearance, pistol grip, and semi-automatic functionality, was classified as an “excessively lethal firearm” by proponents of the ban. Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004). This flawed logic exposed the major weaknesses of the ban. The legislation focused heavily on appearances rather than functionality, meaning firearms that operated identically to banned guns but looked different remained legal. The SPAS-12, for example, was essentially just a heavier, bulkier version of many legally available shotguns. The law failed to target criminal misuse of firearms, instead restricting law-abiding citizens from purchasing certain guns simply because they looked “scary.” Further demonstrating its ineffectiveness, a 2004 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that the Assault Weapons Ban had no measurable impact on gun violence during its ten-year enforcement (Koper, 2004). Even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a meta-analysis and found “insufficient evidence” that banning certain firearms reduced crime rates (Hahn et al., 2005). The sunset clause in the AWB ensured that the law would expire on September 13, 2004, unless renewed by Congress, which did not occur (Kleck, 2001). However, due to the ban’s restrictions on importation, shipments of the SPAS-12 to the United States ended in 1994, with Franchi ultimately ceasing production of the model in 2000. Ironically, instead of reducing access to “dangerous weapons,” the ban fueled demand for firearms like the SPAS-12, driving up prices and making them more desirable to collectors. Today, the SPAS-12 remains a sought-after collectible, proving that cosmetic bans do little more than inconvenience lawful gun owners while failing to address actual crime. The SPAS-12 gained legendary status not only among firearm collectors but also in Hollywood and video games. It was famously wielded by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 in The Terminator (1984), reinforcing its image as a formidable weapon. Additionally, Robert Muldoon, the game warden in Jurassic Park (1993), carried a SPAS-12 while facing off against velociraptors. The gun also became a staple in the gaming world, appearing in franchises such as: This widespread representation cemented the SPAS-12’s place in pop culture, making it one of the most recognizable shotguns ever produced. Many firearm enthusiasts consider the SPAS-12 to be a “grail gun”, meaning it is a highly desirable and rare firearm in the collecting community. The limited availability and cultural significance of the SPAS-12 have led to a massive increase in its market value. When the shotgun was still in production, its retail price in the United States was approximately $1,500 in its final year of availability. By 2016, auction prices for the SPAS-12 had climbed to an average of $2,588 (Rock Island Auction, 2016). The value increase continued at an unprecedented rate, and by 2022, the price of an SPAS-12 at auction had skyrocketed to an average of $7,000. As of 2025, the SPAS-12 remains one of the hottest collectibles in the firearms market, with some pristine examples exceeding $10,000 at auction. This dramatic price surge outpaces many other classic firearms and highlights the enduring demand for rare and historically significant tactical shotguns (Miller, 2023).

Additionally, they offer custom heirloom-grade display cases and handcrafted leather goods built to last. The Benelli M2 also has the option to switch between semi-auto and pump, though the semi action is inertia blowback instead of gas-operated. That makes the cycling unreliable when the M2 isn’t fully shouldered/supported (like when firing from the hip). Similar to “limp-wristing” a Glock. I remember those things. The joke at time was that it was called SPAS because a spase is what it is. (Slang at the time among teens for another kid that was socially awkward.) Never owned one, but I did own a Benelli M3 Super 90. Pump/auto. Neither fish nor fowl. Hated it. Disposed of it at the first gun show I could. Liked all the M1 Super 90s I owned. Let’s see 1500 in 2000 money adjusted for inflation to 2025 would be 2,785 so 2016 probably would have been the last reasonable price. RE: “Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004).” The old piss poor sporting purpose defense of the 2A all while not defining Gun Control by its History…how dare we embarrass our Gun Control colleagues. The Founders and millions of defenseless victims of Gun Control were rolling over in their graves. Thankfully Bush II let the clinton/biden Gun Control insanity sunset. As for Franchi they produce nice shotguns. I own one since 1996. There are easier shotguns to use in pump action and reload, but when you start shooting it fast in semiauto, the muzzle rise is minimal. Also the recoil is… tame. That thing shoots fast and straight. I love it, and after many thousands of rounds, tens of thousands, it still goes as new. Top!!! “Robust build”? Except for those parts made from plastic which are getting brittle with age. Plastic doesn’t get brittle. I’ve a pair of Glocks made in 1851 and they’re still as robust as they were when Wild Bill Hickok was using them. I forgot to say. $10,000 for one of these things? What do they say about a fool and his money? This is not a three digit serial number, first generation Colt SAA calvary model. Scarcity is a bitch, see also Colt python pre2020, s&w pre lock, pre freedom group Marlin lever rifles for silliness at the low end. Could probably throw in Kimber for pre mim parts Safe, I understand. I have a 6″ stainless Python that I bought for myself as a present to myself when I got out of the U. S. Army. A long time ago. I can touch a 6 1/2″ 2nd model hand ejector target.44 Spl and a S&W 28 Highway Patrolman now. Everyone says they’re worth a lot more than I paid for them. Good. But a SPAS? No accounting for collectors, still at a loss to explain the $500+ pricing for Nagant rifles. Supply shortage caused by the war in Ukraine? Many have been spotted being used in the conflict. The market will achieve equilibrium. If they were still in production and not disappearing on a battlefield where they will never get to the US sure. Realistically it will be a long time of a lot of estate sales allowing them to trickle back into the market that has enough other desirable products to see any reasonable drop in prices for milsurp of any kind…….. except maybe m1 carbines we may eventually get some of those back in large numbers. The first thing that comes to my mind when I see this gun is “Clever girl”. Unfortunately, it’s not a shining moment for the gun.

Title: My Stock Market Abundance Plan

Time Published: 2025-04-27T13:00:16Z

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted April 27, 2025 by Ben Carlson I liked Abundance by Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein because the theme of the book is about doing stuff rather than scarcity. The big ideas from the book revolve around the fact that there’s too much red tape when it comes to things like housing, energy, healthcare and technology development. If nothing else, the idea of making it easier to build more housing is something I’m completely on board with. But there was one area of the book that was lacking — the stock market. I thought I could help these guys out and give them the Ben Carlson Stock Market Abundance Plan. Here’s the deal: Roughly 60% of American households own stocks but the top 10% owns 87% of the market. We need more people involved in the stock market. I have a two-part plan to make this happen. Just half of all Americans have savings in a retirement plan such as a 401k. We need to fix that. The Thrift Savings Plan is the defined-contribution retirement plan for federal government employees. It’s the best 401k plan there is. There are just five individual fund options, all extremely low-cost1 index funds — U.S. large cap, U.S. small cap, international, aggregate bond, and U.S. treasuries. Plus they have targedate funds made up of these fund options. The funds are managed by BlackRock and State Street. Why is this plan only available to government employees? It should be open to anyone with a job. Many employees have no access to a 401k. Part one of my abundance plan is that anyone who earns a paycheck and pays taxes has the ability to access the TSP retirement plan. In fact, you should be auto-enrolled and forced to opt out of the plan if you don’t wish to contribute. Part two of my plan involves a little more long-term thinking. I want $10,000 from the government into a Roth IRA account for every child born in America today. Don’t worry — there are stipulations on this account. It has to go into the stock market or a targetdate fund. You can’t touch it until age 21. And you can only take the money out at that age to pay for things like student loans, a down payment on a house or to start a business. Otherwise you have to let it ride in the market. After 21 years at 8% growth, $10k turns into $50k. Over 30 years, $10k turns into $100k. Just think about how helpful that would be to young people trying to get their footing in life. It would ease the burden on parents. It would allow young people to take more risks. It would make it easier for them to start a life after school. Would it be expensive? Yeah but it’s an investment in our future. Are there things I haven’t accounted for in my analysis? Sure. But I don’t want the stock market to be just a place for the upper echelon of society. The top 1% owns 50% of the stock market. The bottom 50% owns 1% of the stock market. We should make it easier for more people to save for retirement and invest in the stock market. That’s my abundance plan. Michael and I spoke to Derek about the book, how it relates to the current environment, trade wars and more: ﻿ Podcast version here: 1The small cap fund costs 5 basis points.

Title: The implications of Trump’s big bet on tariffs

Editor’s Note: President Donald Trump’s massive wager on tariffs with your money came together over years. It took just days to fall apart. This is Part 4 of an in-depth, contemporaneous look at the first 100 days of Trump’s second term. When the stock market started chewing through retirement accounts like a wheat thresher, business owners began howling about the risk of ruination, and economic analysts commenced clanging warning bells of a possible worldwide recession, many political watchers thought surely President Donald Trump would take notice. They were certain he would finally see the existential danger of slapping punishing tariffs on scores of countries and step back from his potentially catastrophic plan. Instead, in the 10th week of his new term, the 47th president is leaning into his latest favorite metaphor: that international trade is a high-stakes card game and he is the master strategist. Only he knows which countries hold a strong hand, which do not, and how bets should be placed. And he is laying down a massive wager. “For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he proclaims to an adoring crowd of Republican VIPs. They have assembled at the White House to celebrate what he calls his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Up at the podium, Trump gleefully displays a chart thick with numbers purporting to show just how much each country will pony up for access to the great American marketplace. But experts who have played the trade game much longer quickly call Trump’s big move on the second day of April a fool’s bet — one that could poison US trade relations with those friendly partners he mentioned and open the door for less friendly competitors to capitalize on his misstep. Skeptics say Trump is flirting with the kind of failure that can unwind a presidency. Trump meets their warnings with a jutted jaw and declarations that he will not blink. To understand how Trump came so quickly to such a perilous spot after much talk, many threats and occasional applications of tariffs in much smaller degrees, it’s worth considering what those close to him have said for years. He truly believes the ability to tax imported goods is a near-mythical power to wipe away trade deficits, stop illegal immigration, control trafficking in illicit drugs, and make the world bow to his will. Aside from military force, he seems to see tariffs as the most direct way a president can rule over not just the United States, but everyone, everywhere. “I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said back on Inauguration Day just as he had on the campaign trail, “because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.” It’s an intriguing claim considering how little good came out of his initial tilt with tariffs. Over the four years of Trump’s first term, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping took turns levying tariffs on pork, solar panels, steel pipes, fruit, nuts, intellectual property, recycled aluminum and more. They eventually worked out an agreement, satisfying Trump’s need to declare himself the master negotiator. But subsequent studies found the promise he extracted for China to buy an additional $200 billion in US goods and services went almost entirely unfulfilled. President Joe Biden maintained those tariffs, but as a practical matter, Trump’s first trade war ended in a draw. Still, this time around Team Trump insists it is making a bigger, longer play. By squeezing world markets simultaneously, the US will drive other countries away from their protectionist tendencies. Better trade balances will follow. Jobs that once moved away from America to find cheaper labor will come back to avoid higher import fees. Gleaming new factories will spring up like wildflowers. Trump will triumph. “Remember the armies of millions of millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones? That kind of thing is going to come to America!” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick says on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” raising the specter of factories full of laborers as a grand vision for the future. But then Lutnick clarifies: Any modern factories will undoubtedly include massive amounts of automation. He’s talking about other, better jobs for the people he says will benefit from Trump’s big tariff gamble. “High school-educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.” For many economists, labor analysts and technology specialists, it is a laughably far-fetched idea. Even if tariffs can offset some of the lower wages elsewhere, big investments in big properties — such as manufacturing plants — take years, even if investors are fully confident in the political stability of the host nation. What’s more, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden had already boosted American manufacturing jobs to higher levels than Trump ever saw in his first term. Indeed, 20% of domestic factories that are underproducing say a shortage of workers is to blame. By 2033, some researchers say more than half of all new manufacturing jobs in the US could be unfilled. CNN’s Matt Egan, one of the most astute economic reporters around, spoke to a former Ford executive and came away with a cautionary tale. Even that giant of American auto production “had trouble finding qualified workers to work in their assembly plants,” Egan says. And some of those they did find? “They ended up quitting because they didn’t realize just how difficult the job would be.” In a broad sense, Trump is right to say many of America’s once-thriving, old-fashioned factory towns descended into dust and decay in part because other countries used tariffs to protect their manufacturing industries. Some statistics show that most of America’s big trading partners have higher import fees, making US goods more costly and putting US exporters at a disadvantage. But there is precious little evidence to support Trump’s notion that America’s future economic glory will come from pushing its citizens back to assembly lines that, based on his descriptions, often sound like the kind of heavy production of the post-World War II years. And make no mistake: Despite everything Trump says, foreign nations will not pay all these tariffs. Instead, economic analysts overwhelmingly say American consumers will foot most of the monumental bill for what those experts call Trump’s taxes. Perhaps it should be no surprise then, that within days of Trump’s “Liberation” event, even nominal friends who supported him in the election are skimming wild cards toward the president’s carefully stacked tariff deck. “We’ve got to become friends with Canada again,” Joe Rogan says on one of the most popular podcasts in the world with millions of listeners per episode. “I can’t believe that there is anti-American and anti-Canadian sentiment going on. This is the dumbest f**king feud.” “The idea that this is good and makes the American economy inherently stronger is wrongheaded,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro says to his own vast audience. “Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impose hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on Americans without public or congressional input.” Estimates start appearing in the news about cars costing thousands of dollars more; the price of televisions, bananas, clothing, computers and sporting goods skyrocketing. Considering that voters’ anger over inflation helped propel Trump back to the White House, the idea that he would risk driving prices into the stratosphere with such a big, early move is alarming to even some GOP lawmakers. “High prices are obviously something no one wants to pay — I understand the concern they have,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, tells CNN while nodding to the hope that other countries might cave to Trump’s demands before the worst hits the home front. On the Democratic side, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky says the damage is already being done by Trump’s weeks of threatening tariffs, imposing them, then pausing them. “It’s the uncertainty,” McGarvey says. “It’s the on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again. … Our phones are ringing off the hook right now. People see their 401(k)s, they see their college funds for their kids just cratering.” CNN’s Jamie Gangel sees lawmakers of all stripes looking at the days and weeks ahead and quaking. “They don’t know what Donald Trump is going to wake up and decide.” The Yale Budget Lab says Trump’s tariffs will raise costs for the average American family by $3,800 annually. Some analysts picking apart how the administration calculated those retaliatory tariff rates noted the tariff formula released by the White House seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a formula generated by ChatGPT. As if to underscore the administration’s seemingly slapdash approach, the Trump plan is found to include a 10% tariff on some Antarctic islands where there are no people. Only penguins. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump in the election, posts his concerns online. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war,” Ackman writes, “we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country.” The metric for fear on Wall Street (there really is such a thing) is pegging at levels not seen since Covid-19 shattered global supply chains. The stock market is splashing red across newscasts, showing $6 trillion in lost value over a week. Respected financial institutions are putting the odds of a recession well above 50%. Even Elon Musk takes an apparent swing at Trump’s call for a 20% tariff on Europe. The richest man in the world — and a top adviser to the president — tells a right-wing political conference in Italy he’d like to see a “zero tax situation … a free trade zone between Europe and North America.” A chief architect and defender of Trump’s tariff policy, Peter Navarro, suggests Musk is trying to protect his electric car business. The Tesla CEO calls Navarro a “moron … dumber than a sack of bricks.” Musk will later apologize — to bricks. “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” the president posts on Truth Social, pushing for a rally. At a fundraiser for congressional Republicans, he insists the White House is being flooded with messages from abroad. “I know what the hell I’m doing,” Trump says, implying that his refusal to give an inch is paying off, as Republican lawmakers keep praising his steel spine. “These countries are calling us up, kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” the leader of the free world says as if he is about to lay his winning hand on the table Less than 24 hours later, he folds. The president imposes a 90-day suspension for many of the tariffs he had declared nonnegotiable. It happens so suddenly that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is testifying in a congressional hearing when he hears about the new strategy. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, rips into the White House witness for claiming to know what was happening — and then seeming just as surprised as everyone else. “WTF! Who’s in charge?” Horsford shouts. “There is no strategy! This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop!” Amid reports that an alarming shift in the bond market — a key pillar of US economic power — is what made Trump retreat, the president’s team insists he did not buckle at all. Although many were praising him hours earlier for refusing to budge on his tariff demands, they are now crowing about his wily genius. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says this was Trump’s “strategy all along.” Brilliant. The ultimate dealmaker. The praise is unending among Republicans, and the financial markets come surging back for their best day in 16 years. Trump declares victory. In the cold light of morning, reality returns. Commentators outside the MAGA echo sphere start saying all Trump did was push the world dangerously close to an economic disaster and then proclaim himself a hero for backing away from the calamity he created. The prediction of the Yale Budget Lab adjusts upward — now placing the annual tariff tax on families at $4,700. To make matters worse, some analysts say Trump’s brash bet substantially weakened the faith of other nations in the reliability of the US government. “Biggest winner is China. Hands down.” On the “Pivot” podcast, which scrutinizes the intersection of business, tech and politics, entrepreneur and New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway pulls no punches. “Every Chinese diplomat and businessman … they’re all working overtime and they’re going to European capitals; they’re going everywhere … and they are saying, ‘You may not agree with us, but you know what? We’re good partners.’” Analysts note, through all the ups and downs, the financial markets have still not returned to Inauguration Day levels when all of Trump’s tariff talk was still theory. What’s more, a social media post from Trump saying “this is a great time to buy” a few hours before his about-face brings accusations of illegal insider trading, to which the White House accuses Democrats of playing “partisan games.” In addition, when it becomes clear how many tariffs have not been suspended, and how China is now facing at least a whopping 145% fee to send goods into the US, the markets nosedive again. China calls Trump’s policies a “joke,” strikes back with its own 125% tariff on US goods, and financial experts refuse to lower their predictions of a possible recession. Indeed, Larry Fink, the CEO of the gargantuan, global investment company BlackRock, says on CNBC in mid-April, “I think we are very close, if not in a recession now.” Trump says he’s waiting on a call from China to discuss some sort of deal, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.” But it appears they don’t — at least not at the levels they did when voters put him back into office. A University of Michigan study, taken before the tariff uproar, is released and shows consumer sentiment at its second lowest level since 1952 with fears of inflation charging upward. Farmers go back to worrying about what will happen to overseas sales of their crops. Businesspeople return to fretting about rising costs and ebbing sales. Working families brace for it all to come crashing down on their bank accounts. Less than one hundred days into his second turn at the presidency, Donald Trump has bet the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Americans on his deep affection for tariffs. He has started the most significant trade war in generations. It is not clear whether he can end it. CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Title: ‘Major’ U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion."

More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis. In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Comments from the Trump administration about some negotiations on Chinese tariffs and rumors of impending trade deals with India and Japan boosted stocks. The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports. US Dollar Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet’s results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%. 1Q 2025 US Economic Growth Estimates A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn’t invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchasers will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchasers at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren’t the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic. Measures Of US Economic Activity The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and first quarter earnings release are this weekend. While Warren Buffett has avoided discussing politics recently, he might be willing to provide some insights into the expected impact on Berkshire’s diversified group of businesses.

Title: It’s Time To Buy Muni Bond Funds—Here’s Why And Where

ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Good news for savers in fairly high tax brackets: Yields on municipal bonds are good, comfortably ahead of what you can clear from Treasury bonds. Bad news: This is a treacherous field. It is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. For tax-sheltered accounts like IRAs, munis are inappropriate; there, use this survey of taxable bonds and bond funds. For taxable accounts, munis are a buy. Says Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in ten years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early (see rule #3 below), but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. What about that talk of making interest on all state and municipal debt federally taxable (for the first time)? Haskell: “Am I threatened? No.” If this happens, he says, existing bonds will be grandfathered. And if the wise people in Congress decree that henceforth states and cities can issue only taxable debt, his job is not over. The same sewers and school buildings would have to be financed, and the clientele for the bonds would expand to include investors who don’t touch them now, like foreigners and endowment funds. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. This fund survey aims to make the investment easy. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: We narrow the roster of those worth looking at to 40. First, exchange-traded funds, the newer kind of fund that until recently had scarcely anything to offer to muni investors. Here’s a list of 24 of them. These ETFs have annual expense burdens no higher than 0.18%. They each average a daily trading volume of at least $1 million, meaning that you can probably get in and out without getting eaten alive by the bid/ask spread: The older style of fund is a mutual fund. No-load mutuals impose no trading costs but tend to have higher expense ratios. Alas, the subset of municipal-bond mutuals with bargain expense ratios is tiny. All of the funds shown here come from Vanguard. Note: Where Vanguard has both a small-stakes share class starting at $3,000 and a large-stakes version for buyers putting in $50,000, the table displays only the latter. There are two problems with individual tax-exempt bonds. One is that they are hard to research. The IOU you thought was backed by a city or state may in fact be backed only by the revenue from a decrepit nursing home. Do you really want to spend your free time reading fine print? The other matter is that muni bonds are hard to trade. You were perhaps planning to hold until redemption, but things happen. You might need to raise cash. Or you might want to take a tax loss during a spike in interest rates. To get an idea of what befalls small investors trying to sell, take a look at the bond offerings on your brokerage platform. How many are listed as available for sale but with no quote on the bid side? A blank spot for the bid is an indication that, if you need to unload in a hurry, you will get hosed by a middleman. Cashing out a muni fund, in contrast, is easy. To swap for a tax loss, find a substitute fund that isn’t exactly the same. Example: Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond Index behaves much like iShares National Muni Bond but is sufficiently different that the IRS can’t call the swap a wash. After 31 days you can go back where you were, if you want to. It’s easy to find a well-managed fund costing an annual 0.1% or less. It might make sense to pay a little more to get what you want in duration (rate risk) or timing (as with those target-date funds). But not a lot more. Don’t be led astray by the double-tax-free allure of a fund holding only home-state bonds. State income tax rates are usually less than 10%, and muni yields about 4%. There is, that is, not a lot of state tax to be avoided. Kentucky’s flat tax rate is 4%, so the most that a rational Kentucky resident would pay in incremental cost to avoid local tax is 4% of 4%, or 0.16%. How curious that holders of the class C shares of the Nuveen Kentucky Municipal Bond fund pay 1.93% in annual fees, 64 times what they’d pay to hold a muni bond index ETF from Vanguard. Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary, has another 24 single-state funds on offer for the mathematically challenged. Simple rule of thumb: If Vanguard has a single-state fund for your state, buy it. If Vanguard doesn’t, buy a national fund. The customary practice for a state or city borrowing money is to offer a fairly high coupon on a bond due in 30 years, while reserving the right to call the bond in early beginning in 10 years. For the bond issuer this arrangement is rather nice. For the bond buyer it’s awful. It turns the investment into a heads-you-break-even, tails-you-lose proposition. If interest rates go down, the issuer calls in the bond. That is, the buyer has the good coupon for only 10 years. If rates go up, the issuer stands pat, leaving the buyer stuck for another 20 years at a below-market yield. This unwanted 20-year bond will trade at a discount. The lopsided set of possible outcomes makes quite a contrast to the bet on a noncallable 30-year Treasury bond. Long Treasuries are risky, but the risk is symmetric. They fall in value if interest rates climb, but they are just as likely to rise in value as interest rates go down. Muni owners should be cognizant that they have made asymmetric bets on interest rates. In other words: Muni bond yields overstate expected returns. By how much? To properly answer that question you need to assess, using each bond’s coupon, call date and maturity date, the effect of 10,000 possible paths that interest rates might take between now and 2055, and assign a probability to each path. Such a calculation would be a bit impractical. But you can get a sense of how harmful call provisions are by observing how much compensation investors demand for putting up with them. For AAA-rated munis the yield curve (2 years out versus 30 years) is 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, steeper than the yield curve for Treasuries. A portfolio of long-dated callable bonds has embedded in it some appreciable fraction of that 50 basis points as an expected loss from rate volatility. The following table of net yields aims to deliver rough justice to the situation. It debits the officially reported yields on long-term muni funds for an estimate of call damage. Taxes are allowed for, as well, at different income levels, in two high-tax states. Conclusion: For people in moderately high or very high tax brackets, municipal debt is usually more rewarding than Treasury debt. It’s just not quite as good a deal as bond salesmen would have you believe. The 22% federal bracket, which starts at $96,950 of taxable income on a joint return, is where muni bond interest begins to beat out Treasury bond interest. In the next bracket up, 24%, most couples are also paying a 3.8% investment tax, for a combined federal rate of 27.8%. What about the alternative minimum tax? This affliction largely evaporated with the passage of the 2017 tax law. If the problem reappears, which would happen if Congress fails to extend that law, AMT is still likely to matter only in money-market muni funds and in high-yield muni funds. In short, it’s not worth paying extra fees to get a fund labeled “AMT-free.” State rates, which never apply to U.S. Treasury interest and usually but not always apply to interest on out-of-state municipal bonds, range from 0% to 14.8%. Two states with stiff taxes, New York and California, are home to low-fee double-tax-free funds. New York bonds have pretty good yields. California yields, however, are not terrific and investors there are often better off buying a national muni fund. A peculiarity of the tax code gives fund investors an advantage over bond investors. Say a bond comes out at par and sinks to 90 cents on the dollar as rates rise. If you buy at 90 and redeem at 100, the 10-point gain is taxed as ordinary income (which is totally unfair). Now let’s say a fund buys bonds at 100 and, as interest rates rise, the bonds fall in price to 90 and the fund shares fall in price from $100 to $90. You buy the fund at $90 and see its shares gradually recover as its bonds mature and get cashed out at par. You now sell the fund at $100. Your $10 gain is taxed at the lower capital gain rate.

Title: Trade-war panic is so overblown that it's a great time to buy, these Wall Street strategists say

Thanks to the trade war, Americans are feeling downright awful about the economy. The latest University of Michigan consumer survey reported an 8% decline in sentiment from March, as consumers worried about inflation, unemployment, and their financial situation. It's not only consumers — the American Association of Individual Investors recently reported the 12th consecutive week of a negative bull-bear spread, meaning that more investors were bearish than bullish on the stock market. However, a growing cohort of market experts is shunning the doom-and-gloom narrative that the economy is on a collision course with recession. In their opinion, the bad vibes aren't quite aligning with reality. After all, corporate earnings are strong, the labor market is in good shape, and households have robust balance sheets. Their advice? Don't let the negative news discourage you from buying into the stock market at a discount now. Often, overly bearish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator for a market rebound. Here's why these four strategists are keeping a cool head on tariffs and are ultimately optimistic about the market. To Levine, extremely low investor sentiment means that it's unlikely for markets to fall much further. "Recession's on everybody's lips, and in some ways, that's a really good thing because, as you know, when the market is expecting something, the news of it itself is less likely to cause a downside whoosh," Levine told BI. "The market has de-risked a lot of the downside scenarios." Ultimately, the stock market crash and negative sentiment are all self-inflicted by Trump, meaning that there's nothing wrong with the underlying economy, Levine said. On the bright side, any change in policy can also greatly reduce the chance of a recession. Trump has shown himself amenable to negotiations, as he floated the idea of scaling back tariffs on China earlier this week. Levine believes that some sort of tariff deal will be struck before the 90-day tariff pause is up. "There's some expectation that this is the peak of the tariffs, and so, as those move lower, that would seem to feed into the sense that there is right tail here," Levine said. DeSpirito, who oversees several income and value funds including the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), has never been too concerned about Trump tariffs ruining the economy. Back in March, DeSpirito said on Bloomberg that it was a mistake for banks to be downgrading their stock market outlooks, and he's held steady to that view. "Periods of uncertainty are actually great buying opportunities. Once the uncertainty abates, companies are very adaptive," DeSpirito told BI. Right now, DeSpirito is seeing opportunities in healthcare services, medical devices, aerospace, and defense companies. "In healthcare, I'm finding a lot more opportunity in services than I am in large-cap pharma. Large cap pharma has a lot of issues around where they locate their intellectual property," DeSpirito said. "A number of them have large patent expirations that are upcoming." DeSpirito thinks the market is overly focused on the risk and overlooking opportunities down the road. He's confident that kinks in trade policy will be ironed out soon. "In addition to greater certainty around trade, you'll also get deregulation, which will be a positive for the market and when you think about tariffs as a source of revenue, that revenue source will create more flexibility on the policy side," DeSpirito said. Tariff concerns have led many investors to diversify outside the US stock market, but Curtis believes the "sell America" narrative is overblown. Instead of fleeing to international stocks, Curtis believes investors should be doubling down on US leaders like the Magnificent Seven. Especially now that many of the Big Tech names are down roughly 20% from all-time highs, Curtis sees a good opportunity for investors to add to their positions in high-quality companies for cheap. "This productivity gain that we're going to get from artificial intelligence is going to be profound and those companies, many of them Mag 7, hold the keys to that," Curtis said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. Curtis is also bullish on defensive sectors like healthcare, where demand for treatments will remain constant no matter what part of the economic cycle we're in. He sees innovations in GLP-1 medications and AI driving sustained future growth for the healthcare sector. "Those businesses are as good as they were over the long term prior to Inauguration Day, and those companies are incredibly well-positioned for what's about to come," Curtis said of the Magnificent Seven. It's easy to buy into a doomsday recession narrative, but Schulze doesn't see much evidence to back it up. There's been a lot of talk about how consumer sentiment is at historic lows, but actions are more important than sentiment itself, he said. "In this cycle in particular, it's more important to watch what people do rather than what they say, because when you look at the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, it's been low and declining, yet consumption has been fairly broad-based over the last couple of years," Schulze said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. US consumers might not feel so optimistic, but numbers show they're in great shape. Household debt levels are low, and many homeowners locked in low mortgage rates, insulating them from their biggest monthly expense, according to Schulze. "This is a great opportunity to be dollar-cost averaging into the weakness that we've seen," Schulze said. "A lot of negativity has been priced in a short period of time for US equities, and I don't see any structural excesses in the economy that would cause a deep recession." Jump to

This week, markets across the board have remained relatively calm, with price action reflecting a clear consolidation phase. The Nasdaq, for instance, has formed an inside bar on the weekly chart, meaning the current candle is trading within the high and low of last week's range. This often signals indecision or a buildup before a larger move. Bitcoin is following a similar pattern. After several weeks of upward movement, the cryptocurrency has entered a tight trading range, consolidating just below key resistance levels. This type of price behavior typically precedes a breakout, and the direction of that breakout could set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move. Don't Miss: Weekly Analysis: Bitcoin Trading Within a Defined Range On the higher timeframe, Bitcoin remains locked within a clear weekly range. Earlier this week, it dipped below the swing low from March 10, capturing liquidity beneath that level before bouncing back. This kind of price action suggests that buyers are still active and willing to step in at lower prices. However, Bitcoin has not yet pushed through the key range high near 88,742. This level has now acted as resistance twice, reinforcing its importance. If price returns to this area, how it reacts will be crucial. A clean break above it could open the door to a move toward the 92,000s and possibly set the stage for a run toward all-time highs. On the other hand, another rejection could mark the formation of a local top and increase the chances of a deeper pullback. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Key Levels and Market Scenarios to Watch As of now, Bitcoin is holding above 83,000, showing signs of strength despite the consolidation. If it continues to trade above this level and gains momentum, the next upside targets to monitor are 88,000 and then the 92,000s. These levels will be essential in determining whether the current consolidation leads to continuation or reversal. Should Bitcoin break below 83,000 with conviction, particularly on daily closes, a move down toward the low 80,000s becomes likely. If that support fails to hold, price could revisit the mid-74,000s, an area of previous consolidation and strong demand. For bullish momentum to remain intact in the bigger picture, Bitcoin needs to stay above 66,000, which marked the low around the election period. As long as price holds above this key higher low, the broader uptrend remains in place, and any pullbacks can be viewed as potential buying opportunities.

Wrapping Up Bitcoin is currently in a state of pause after a strong run-up, with price coiling beneath resistance and holding above key support. This kind of consolidation often precedes a decisive move, and traders should be prepared for volatility to return once the range is broken. Whether the breakout comes to the upside or downside will depend on the strength of the next move around the 88,000 and 83,000 zones. As always, staying patient and reactive to price behavior at these key levels will be critical for navigating the next phase in Bitcoin's trend. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: Letters: Stories in ink on paper have no equal in these days of 24/7 news

There is something very satisfying about having a newspaper in your hands. Photo: Getty Sunday Independent newspaper Sir — Reading news printed on paper is not the same as listening to news on the radio or looking at it on the television or on your phone. Buying a newspaper in a shop, holding a newspaper or placing it on a table to read, turning the pages, choosing the order in which you read it, doing the crossword, placing a cup of tea in the middle of the page you’re not reading, cutting out an article to keep, folding the newspaper or rolling it and putting it in your back pocket, putting it in the recycle bin, or the tempus fugit frisson you get when you open and read a crumpled ball of newspaper once used to wrap a rediscovered vase in the attic — have no equivalents in other media modalities. Newsprint on paper has a physicality all of its own. Newspapers hold a mirror to society; they also hold a lamp — to expose what is ignored or what lies hidden or buried or forgotten. The quality of newspapers is an indicator of the quality of a society. In a world of 24/7 newsfeed, Sunday newspapers occupy a special place — more content, more investigative scoops, more reflective, more glossy, more supplements, more entertainment, more time to read, more news. Newspaper journalists and editors are key workers who provide an essential service; we saw this during Covid and we see it every time there is a crisis; we also see it when we look at countries where newspapers and media are organs of propaganda or in places where journalists are denied access. Being a newspaper journalist or editor is a challenging job, not least having to compete for readers who are being bombarded on all sides by free, fake, sensationalist news. In this context I would like to thank you, in your final edition, on the job you did as editor of the Sunday Independent. Chris Fitzpatrick, Terenure Road East, Dublin 6 Sir — Pope Francis ­re-energised Catholicism by ­living a simple life based on gospel values. By his energy, ­humanity, openness, humility, compassion, repentance and reforms, he regained the confidence of the flock. His successor needs to be cut from the same cloth as him. The decline in active priests ­requires consolidation and best use of its resources by the Catholic Church. Goodwill and generosity of spirit are required at all levels of the church, which must continue to adapt and modernise to meet the spiritual needs of contemporary society. Gender inequality and compulsory celibacy are denying the faithful the service of many fine individuals who would make ­excellent priests. Women have given outstanding ­service, devotion and loyalty to the church, but are denied ordination. Imag­ine the reinvigoration and energy, in addition to a substantial increase in available priests, that would permeate all levels of the church if women could become priests. A priest should always have the right to remain single but should also be entitled to marry. Likewise, ordination should be available to a married person. In a society where the role of the Catholic Church must be predominantly pastoral and inclusive, the sacraments of holy orders and matrimony can no longer be mutually exclusive. Francis has ensured the sustainability of Catholicism into the future. It will be less ­influential in secular society. It must co-exist and co-operate with other religions and none. It will have to work hard to retain the confidence of the laity. However, as long as it’s grounded in Francis’s values of social justice, humility, altruism, equality and reconciliation, count me in as an active and committed member. Billy Ryle, Spa, Tralee, Co Kerry Sir — In 2005, Paddy O’Gorman on his radio programme interviewed a betting man in a Cork bookie shop who had landed a healthy accumulator a few weeks earlier. Pope John Paul II had died the previous day, and our friend decided to use the manna from heaven to attend the funeral. So off they popped, the pious punter, his wife and sister-in-law. Rome, of course, was packed with mourners — roadblocks and diversions everywhere, thousands at the checkpoints. But our Leeside trio were ushered forward at every turn, right up to the cortege and with the best viewing points wherever they went. Apparently, the authorities and security crews assumed they had come from Poland, the Pope’s homeland, and gave them preferential treatment. They were wearing their Cork GAA jerseys. Des Nix, Raheny, Dublin 5 Sir — I am sure Saint ­Francis of Assisi would be so proud of his namesake, our humble Pope Francis, for his empathy for the poor and marginalised. Looking back on his visit to Ireland in 2018, it was difficult for him as he didn’t have the ­euphoria that marked Pope John Paul II’s wonderful time here. At the state event in Dublin Caste to honour his visit, Francis sat thoughtfully listening to then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s warm welcoming words, which were also laced with pointed criticism of the Catholic Church. There was a sense he was being chastised for all the church’s failings in Ireland and, perhaps, even those of the State. Pope Francis, with humility and dignity, acknowledged the shared pain of what he called the “repugnant crimes” of ­clerical abuse. He also saw the fun and the good in the person, whether believer or not. His sense of hum­our must have lightened the heavy burden on his heart and soul. On Easter Sunday, no doubt gravely ill, he still was giving, praying and smiling. The world and the church will be the poorer for his leaving us. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin 18 Sir — On the passing of dear Pope Francis The TV flashback showed him visiting the Capuchin monks Who feed the poor and destitute. They interviewed a homeless person there; she said: “If I wasn’t homeless I would never have met the Pope.” Derek Seymour, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Sir — I happened to find ­myself in possession of two diff­erent sized Cadbury Twirl Easter eggs (retailing at €10 and €6 respectively) and discovered the two eggs were the same size and weight (155g). The only difference in content between the two eggs (apart from the obviousinflated packaging of the more expensive egg) was one Twirl bar. Orla Maguire, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — I googled “Who can be elected Pope?” and was advised that any baptised male could be elected. Is the church aware of the definition of misogyny? M McMahon, Malahide, Co Dublin Sir — Reading comments last Sunday concerning the general subject of letter-writing brought me back to the days when the handwritten letter was the norm. My late mother said to me on several occasions that very intelligent people in some instances had poor handwriting. Given my own scrawl, I always felt that in her subtle way she was reassur­ing me that intellectually I wasn’t quite a write-off. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Sir — Education Minister ­Helen McEntee’s recent threat to introduce legislation to compel schools to take in pupils with special needs is an attempt to distract from the real problem. There is not a school or teacher in Ireland that would refuse admission to children with special needs if the proper facilities were provided by the minister and her department. I acknowledge that there is a serious problem for parents trying to get places for their children. Compelling schools is not necessary and certainly not the solution. There have been a few small units built to cater for children with special needs, but now the department and the minister are no longer providing the necessary grants. Instead, they are suggesting that existing classrooms be used if there are spare ones. In discussion with two ­National Council For Special Education reps recently when I was chairman of a board of management, I asked them about the sensory provision for the pupils. “You can hang a ­curtain in the corner of the classroom,” was the reply I got. Such absurdity I have never heard in my 40 years of involvement with a school. This just proves that the department and the minister are more interested in getting the numbers up than providing the proper facilities. Schools, principals, teachers and boards are absolutely willing to take in children with special needs. Ms McEntee, you need to provide the funding to properly upgrade classrooms or provide the necessary funding to build new units. The solution is in your hands. Walter Lacey, Bullock Park, Carlow Sir — On buying your ­paper last weekend, I hurried to read the articles on Rory McIroy’s ­triumph at the ­Masters. ­Eamonn Sweeney, Tommy ­Conlon and Paul ­Kimmage were excellent, but Declan Lynch nailed it. John McCann, Donegal Sir — Tom Gilsenan (Letters, April 20) opines that there is “a donkey in the White House”. If I were The Donald, I would take that as a compliment of the highest order. Anyone familiar with donkeys will know of their unbelievable qualities: hard-working, calm in stressful situations, wonderful with children, low-maintenance, soothing company, productive. More “donkeys” and fewer high-maintenance temperamental racehorses are needed in ­positions of authority as far as I’m concerned. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir — Eilis O’Hanlon’s article last Sunday on trans ideology was a damning indictment of both government and opposition parties for their failure to acknowledge what the vast ­majority of people believe. The other elephant in the room that her same arguments apply to is illegal immigration. For the past number of years the last government (with Sinn Féin complicit by their silence) ­ignored the law of the land to the extent that there are now 6,000 asylum-seekers from safe countries Georgia and Algeria out of a total of 33,000 in the direct provision system. These numbers are unsustainable, even without impending tariffs. And all sides of the Dáil are silent — shame on them. Bernie Cronin, Clondalkin, Dublin 22 Sir — I was heartbroken by Maeve Sheehan’s report in last week’s Sunday Independent (‘Grace: Harrowing neglect of severely disabled young girl’).It seems to me that the HSE didn’t ward Grace due to the fact that this case was so bad, it was afraid of what would be disclosed. It must be very frightening for disabled people if they know that the agency entrusted with caring for them is going to keep secrets and is not going to be open, honest and transparent regarding their care. This presents immense fear for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters of many disabled people and for disabled people themselves. We must remember that disabled children are three to four times more likely to be abused. It is much more challenging if one doesn’t have a voice. However, we must always be cognisant of the fact that these children can communicate. They communicate by how they behave, so it’s a question of learning what that means. We can often pick up what is going on when a child is initially happy, and then all of a sudden their behaviour changes. Examples of such changes in behaviour are evident if a child starts to hit their head or if they start to bite or scratch. Doctors, nurses, social workers and gardaí need to be properly trained in this area . I would like to know the level of expertise that was involved in the Grace inquiry. It seems to me a lot of solicitors and barristers were involved and not a lot of specialists. There is a gap in our understanding of disability and abuse. If we don’t learn from the Grace case, we will find similar cases emerging. Perish the thought. John O’Brien, clinical psychotherapist, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Sir — Reading the Farrelly Commission report is very depressing. It is unconscionable that a state organisation entrusted with the protection of all vulnerable people should hide the truth to protect itself. We now know that some in the HSE have different ethical codes of practice. This is very worrying and alarming. Those of us who are whistleblowers and know the issues despair of a failed HSE system not fit for purpose. We demand urg­ent political action that leads to safeguarding of our most vulnerable citizens. Dr Margaret Kennedy, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — In recent times I have read advice from financial experts telling workers to join their work pension scheme as early as possible in their working life, as this will put them in a more favourable financial position when they retire. That is good advice. There is another side to this. When a worker starts to draw their pension, they may have a reasonable expectation that their pension payment would keep them within shouting distance of the increasing cost of living. However, my experience has not achieved that expectation. I retired in 2010 after 34 years working for a very profitable company. When I was working I received annual increases in pay, but since I retired my modest pension has not increased by one cent in 15 years. Having not received any increase in my pension payment, I contacted the company and was told that because the pension plan was in deficit, the company had “decided not to award a discretionary increase this year”. I am not a member of any trade union or retirement group. I am a lone voice without power, except for my trusty pen. I note that the CEO of this company is paid millions. The rich are getting richer. Don’t worry about the “old” people. David Riedy, Co Limerick Sir — David Quinn claims that protests on US university campuses “should not be euphemistically described as merely ‘pro-Palestinian’” (‘Student politics is no joke — radicals are sounding alarm bells’, April 20). He is correct, but for the wrong reasons. The protesters in question, like their fellow students elsewhere, are demonstrating in support of international humanitarian law and for ending the impunity that the state of Israel — plausiblyaccused of genocide by the International Court of Justice — enjoys, thanks to the unconditional support it receives from US and EU governments. It is natural that those who support that impunity should experience “hostility”, but to attribute such sensitivity to their being Jewish or Israeli is merelyto accept the Israeli state’s tactic of attributing all opposition to its crimes as antisemitic. In the days of South African apartheid, I’ve little doubt that supporters of white supremacism in South Africa suffered similar unease in the face of protests over racial equality. Raymond Deane, Dublin 7 Sir — David Quinn states that the “Boycott, Divest, Sanction” movement … essentially wants to destroy the Jewish State”. This is not true. Boycott, Div­estment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. It upholds the principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as everyone.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh By María Paula Mijares Torres Apr 26, 2025 (Bloomberg) –President Donald Trump called for “free of charge” passage of American ships through the Panama and Suez canals, renewing his focus of expanding US influence over critical commercial and naval waterways. While Trump began pushing for an exit of Chinese port operators around the Panama Canal soon after returning to the White House in January, the post on his Truth Social network on Saturday also turned attention to the Suez Canal, which cuts through Egypt to link the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. “Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America,” Trump said, adding that he’s asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. Trump’s focus — with tariffs and other measures, such as proposed fees at US ports — has been on Chinese commercial shipping and shipbuilding, with the ultimate goal of promoting a revival of US shipbuilding. The US government argues that China’s dominance in ship construction was achieved unfairly and harms US interests. US commercial shipbuilding, once a global leader, has shriveled since the 1980s due to subsidy cuts and foreign competition.

Title: Will Starlink and other satellite companies eventually rival cellular carriers?

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onApril 26, 2025 Starlink has truly opened our eyes to the power of satellite technology, delivering speeds that rival cable internet in areas previously lacking high-speed options. But Starlink isn’t just about traditional internet use. Earlier this year, T-Mobile and Starlink introduced emergency satellite-to-cell features, including full texting, to mobile phone users for the first time. More recently, Verizon and some of its MVNOs followed suit with a more limited satellite-to-cell service launch for Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 users, in cooperation with Skylo. As satellite providers increasingly team up with major carriers, you might wonder: Will satellite technology ever surpass traditional services from big providers? It’s a compelling thought, but the reality is more complicated. Let’s take a closer look at the major players in the satellite-to-cell space, what they currently offer, and their publicly announced future plans. We’ll also explore the roadblocks holding satellite technology back in the mobile world and whether these issues might eventually become a thing of the past. Although numerous companies are involved in satellite technology, only a handful have directly pursued satellite-to-cell capabilities so far. Recently, Starlink has emerged as the most widely available service, even though its features remain in public beta. Nevertheless, several other companies have significant plans for satellite-to-cell technologies in the future. Starlink is best known for its internet service, but it has also become the biggest satellite-to-cell provider as it offers this service indirectly through partnerships, such as with T-Mobile in the US. The great thing about this partnership is that T-Mobile isn’t keeping satellite features exclusive, as it has allowed subscribers from rival networks to use the feature for free during beta. Skylo provides satellite connectivity across various industries through partnerships as opposed to having its own network. While it’s far from a major player in the satellite-to-cell game right now, Skylo most notably powers Verizon’s emergency SOS features on specific devices and is working with other cellular companies and phone makers to expand emergency SOS features. AST SpaceMobile aims to establish its own low-earth orbit satellite-to-cell network similar to Starlink, but it is still in early development. Unlike Starlink, which has over 7,000 satellites (approximately 400 equipped for cellular service), AST SpaceMobile has only launched five satellites capable of satellite-to-cell connectivity features. Iridium is known primarily for traditional satellite phone services, typically requiring specialized equipment for remote or field use. Currently, it offers the Iridium Go hotspot as a standalone device providing limited satellite-to-cell features, though at very slow speeds that are not suitable as a true cellular service replacement. For what it’s worth, we’ve seen other devices like the Go, including the HMD OffGrid. The big difference is that Iridium controls its own network. Iridium briefly partnered with Qualcomm to develop satellite-to-cell capabilities; however, after this partnership fell through, it shifted its attention toward other future collaborations. Globalstar is another major traditional satellite phone provider. While it continues to primarily focus on traditional satellite customers, it is actively pursuing the expanding satellite-to-cell market, notably through its partnership with Apple. To that end, Apple has invested over $1 billion in Globalstar to support satellite-to-cell features like emergency texting on iPhone 14 and newer devices. Likely, Globalstar will eventually extend its efforts to other manufacturers as well. In addition to already working with Skylo, ViaSat also plans to work with it and other partners on its own constellation of low-orbit satellites that will be designed to connect directly to smartphones and IoT devices without requiring ground infrastructure. This system was successfully tested last year through Skylo in the United Arab Emirates, India, and Saudi Arabia, and so it’s only a matter of time before the company ramps up the effort. While HughesNet doesn’t seem to be pursuing satellite-to-cell partnerships with carriers or manufacturers in any major way just yet, that doesn’t mean it isn’t involved at all. HughesNet currently offers its SatCell Connect service for first responders and field use. As you can see, there are plenty of efforts underway to roll out satellite-to-cell technology. For the most part, partnerships remain the favored approach. Given the current trajectory, it’s unlikely that satellite technology will replace terrestrial cellular service anytime soon, if ever. One major reason is that satellite technology often faces larger regulatory hurdles than the cellular industry. This is especially true for low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. LEO constellations are crucial because they are the only type even theoretically capable of replacing terrestrial service. Traditional satellites suffer from latency and speed limitations that make such a replacement effort impractical. Even if we move past regulatory and technical challenges, there are several inherent advantages to traditional cellular service that are difficult to overcome: To be fair, Starlink’s latency isn’t that much worse than that of broadband (at least compared to regular sat), which suggests latency could become a non-issue over time. But capacity remains a major obstacle and solving it would likely require blanketing the sky with billions of satellites. That’s not just expensive, it’s also a future filled with space junk. And although satellite deployment costs may drop over time, land-based infrastructure will almost always be the more economical option. The truth is, satellite providers don’t want to replace traditional cellular service, and you shouldn’t want that either. The ideal model is a hybrid approach, where carriers provide both ground and satellite coverage. While it’s possible that some carriers may eventually develop their own satellite networks, the infrastructure investment would be massive and likely not worth the cost. From a consumer perspective, there’s no real advantage to satellite-only service either. Let’s be honest: most people don’t care (or even want to know) how their phone connects, as long as it works. In the future, satellite backup will likely become so seamless and integrated that you won’t be able to tell whether you’re connected to a ground tower or a satellite, aside from maybe a latency spike or a small indicator on your phone. And that’s the beauty of it: the ability to connect from anywhere. That’s far more appealing than a future reliant on just satellites or towers.

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

A round-up of the biggest Tech-related news that stood out this week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Motorola's Razr 2025 series dropped, Alphabet's Q1 earnings soar, Meta layoffs impact VR teams, Samsung's summer Unpacked could take place in New York, and Android 16's Beta 4 comes out. Let's dive in. Read more here There's a new Motorola Razr on the block. The Motorola Razr 2025 series arrived this week as a trio for the first time. Showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra. All three devices are bolstered with Moto AI, which is backed by Perplexity AI. The devices also have access to Google's Gemini suite as well. At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance. Razr Ultra: Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in four colorways: Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret. With its premium specs, the Ultra starts at $1,299 and comes with dual storage options of 512GB and 1TB, along with 16GB of RAM. Razr Plus: Razr's premium model just got demoted to being the middle child. This year's Plus variant comes with almost the same specs as last year. With an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display. The Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink. The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, similar to the Razr Plus 2024. It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99. Razr 2025: As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky. The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen. At its core, the phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7400X, a notch higher than its predecessor. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor. The standard model is priced at $699.99, with prices varying based on the carrier in the U.S. and Canada. The Motorola Razr 2025 series will be sold in stores starting May 15. Pre-orders begin on May 7 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store. Along with its clamshells, the company also launched the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer. Read more here Alphabet, Google's parent company, released its Q1 earnings on Thursday (April 24), and it was reported that the company's revenue saw a 12% hike year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed later that evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion. Google's core businesses, including Search, YouTube advertising, and AI, were sizable contributors to this overall growth. "We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai Google's Search also saw a gain of $50.7 billion in revenue, YouTube's advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company, and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion. And Google Cloud also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. During the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products, specifically AI Overviews. Read more here Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for Meta’s Quest VR headsets. In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said. These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added. Employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, were among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well. They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged." Read more here A new rumor suggests that Samsung could be taking its mid-year Unpacked event to New York. According to a Korean news site, The JoongAng Daily, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with its new set of foldables, Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July. NYC could allegedly be playing host after three long years. The last time an Unpacked event was held in the location was back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. An industry insider familiar with Samsung's plan told the publication that, "This time, it will be held again in New York, the most representative cultural city, after three years." There is speculation that the Korean OEM could be switching things up to prioritize the U.S. market. Read more here Earlier this week, Google rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support. The latest update didn't bring any significant changes, as Google is gearing up to launch the stable version of its OS this summer. Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, which fixes two bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. It fixes a weird battery drain, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also tends to certain system stability issues and random launcher crashes that some folks were dealing with. However, a few Pixel users have taken to Reddit to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on: Nandika Ravi is an Editor for Android Central.

Title: 5 Dividend Stocks That Are Bucking The Bear Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/04/26/5-dividend-stocks-that-are-bucking-the-bear-market/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T13:52:00Z

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Bearish scenario in stock market with bear figure in front of red price drop chart. Let’s talk about consumer staples dividend stocks today. If we’re heading for a slowdown then we need to be picky about our payouts. When the economy slows, discretionary spending is often punted but staples continue to be bought. Today we’ll discuss five dividends between 4.2% and 10.7%. These “must have” products can provide our portfolios with important recession-resistant qualities. Year-to-date staples have been flat and, in this market, that is great. Their sideways action has lapped the over-owned S&P 500 this year: XLP Total Returns Consumer staples stocks tend to have more stable operations that result in more stable share performance in turbulent markets. And they also have predictable profits that allow them to pay out better-than-average dividends. But there are exceptions. Perpetually too-popular staples like Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT) deliver sub-1% yields. This also drags down the yields of staples-focused funds. This is why we cherry pick our payouts, as always. Let’s get into these five which yield up to 10.7%. Smokers are going to keep smoking, which is why these two tobacco companies have delivered double-digit gains (against the market’s 15% decline!) since Feb. 19: Altria (MO, 6.9% yield) is best-known for its Philip Morris USA segment, which produces Marlboro cigarettes and is by far and away the company’s top revenue driver. But the company is putting increasing focus on its smokeless products, which include Copenhagen and Skoal smokeless tobacco, On! Oral nicotine pouches, NJOY e-vapor products and—through a joint venture with JT Group called Horizon Innovations—heated tobacco products. Altria has been battling volume declines in cigarettes for years, and it has suffered a few self-inflicted wounds, such as its ill-fated stake in Juul Labs. However, higher prices on cigarettes, as well as growth in its smokeless products, have helped keep earnings and its high dividend on the rise, and both are expected to continue their (admittedly slow) growth in 2025. MO Earnings Growth Ever since the market started sliding in February, investors have been snapping up MO shares to get some of that stability. But Altria is getting expensive—yes, a forward P/E of 11 doesn’t scream “overbought,” but it’s noticeably higher than the 8x-9x valuation it has typically carried over the past few years. British American Tobacco (BTI, 7.5% yield) owns a number of well-known cigarette brands, including Camel, American Spirit and Newport. But it too deals in smokeless tobacco, including Grizzly dipping tobacco, Glo heated tobacco, VELO nicotine pouches, and Vuse vapes. In late 2023, BTI announced it would take a massive noncash writedown—which a few months later would become official, at $34.5 billion—on the value of its American cigarette brands. The stock bottomed in late 2024 and has been recovering ever since, including a roughly 10% gain since the February market top. Despite the writedown, BTI’s top and bottom lines have been generally stable if not improving for years. But the company doesn’t expect sustainable growth until at least 2026, when management believes it will get more support from its smokeless portfolio. Fortunately, the company still keeps finding enough change under the couch to improve its dividend, which it has done in 26 of the past 27 years. A 7%-plus yield is stellar. A forward P/E of 9 not so much once we realize that’s at the high end of its multiyear range. Let’s move on to more traditional consumer staples businesses—but not traditional consumer staples names. The sector’s blue chips tend to be overcrowded, which is a recipe for limited yields. Instead, I prefer stocks that live outside of the spotlight but offer good to great levels of income. SpartanNash (SPTN, 4.2% yield) is a company that we’ve previously discussed as a “grocer-plus.” It operates nearly 200 grocery stores in 10 states across numerous brands, including Family Fresh Market, Metcalfe’s Market and Supermercado Nuestra Familia. But its other, larger segment is a wholesale distribution business that services roughly 2,300 independent grocers across the U.S. The company is several years into a turnaround plan that has helped to rejuvenate the top and bottom lines, but the stock’s performance hasn’t matched. As we said back in 2020, “a look at the past 10 years is probably a decent indication of what the next 10 will broadly look like.” SPTN boasts a decent 4%-plus yield that dwarfs most other grocers, it has raised its distribution for 15 consecutive years, and it pays out just less than half its earnings, so the dividend should have more upside. It’s hard to say the same about the stock price. Management did recently express interest in expanding its Hispanic grocery and convenience store presence, but its plans are in their infancy. BGS Foods (BGS, 10.7% yield) is the name behind brands such as Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Ortega and Bear Creek. Its double-digit yield is largely the product of a slumping stock, with shares off by more than 70% over the past few years amid slumping top and bottom lines. Its 10% return since the market top is something of a small miracle considering its continued operational woes. In late February, B&G reported it was booking charges of $320 million related to “intangible trademark assets” on its Green Giant, Victoria, Static Guard and McCann’s brands. BGS also kept its dividend at 19 cents per share, but it’s an open question as to how long B&G can keep it up. The dividend annualizes to 78 cents per share. The pros expect adjusted profits of 68 cents this year and 73 cents in 2026. Something has to give. FEMSA (FMX, 7.0% yield)—the merciful shorthand for Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V.—isn’t a familiar name, but it’s awfully interesting. FEMSA operates a huge chain of small-box retail stores, called Oxxo, in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Brazil. It uses the same brand for auto service stations in Mexico. It also operates drugstores under several names in Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador. And it owns nearly half of Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF), the world’s largest bottler of Coca-Cola (KO) by volume. FEMSA isn’t automatically a great defensive play, then, if our worry is the U.S. economy. We have to keep our eyes on Mexico to determine FMX’s real utility. But there’s a lot to like here. It has a dominant position in Latin America. Top- and bottom-line growth hasn’t been pristine, but it’s better than many other staples names. Estimates are for 26% profit growth this year, then another 12% in 2026. The dividend itself is generous—FEMSA has become increasingly aggressive about returning capital, and it plans on paying four quarterly ordinary dividends as well as four “extraordinary” dividends, coming out to a yield of about 7%. But while FMX has been plenty fruitful, it has also been more volatile than the average staples stock, and it’s also richly priced at 20 times earnings estimates.

Title: This Event Could Be the Next Catalyst for Intel's Stock

Time Published: 2025-04-26T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Shares of Intel (INTC) finished the week on a down note after its latest financial outlook disappointed investors. The stock’s next catalyst might be just a few days away. Lip-Bu Tan, who presided over the chip company’s quarterly results Thursday for the first time as CEO, will on Tuesday give the keynote address at an event associated with Intel’s Foundry business, which makes chips for other companies. Bank of America analysts in a Friday note said the event could be paired with the announcement of partnerships with other big tech firms. Intel has sought to grow the Foundry business; early last year, it spoke of ambitions to be the world’s second-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) by 2030. Its 2024 foundry revenue, however, fell from a year earlier—it came in north of $17 billion, roughly 30% of the company’s total—and its operating loss widened. This year reports have suggested that Intel might look to sell a stake in the Foundry operation to TSMC; that company, however, has denied talks. Investors were tracking the possibility that a spinoff or sale of Foundry might be in the works well before Tan took over. Investors continue to look for signs of dealmaking. Optimism about a range of possibilities, ranging all the way up to a sale of the entire company, has moved the shares in recent months. That could still be the case. But Tan has said cost-cutting is also a priority: On Thursday, while not formally announcing layoff plans reported earlier in the week, he made clear they are coming. Bank of America analysts, who have a neutral rating for Intel's stock and a $23 price target that is a few cents above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, said Intel is “too big to turn around quickly, but optionality [is] still there.” The stock has lost over a third of its value in the past year through Friday's close.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

Time Published: 2025-04-26T02:15:42Z
Full Content:
26 April 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The compiled reports reflect a broad spectrum of Nepal’s economic and governance dynamics, highlighting issues of regulatory enforcement, infrastructure development, and investment patterns. While NEPSE saw a minor rebound after days of decline, gold prices fell by NPR 1,000 per tola, and consumers continue to bear inflated petroleum costs despite a global price slump—benefiting Nepal Oil Corporation’s profit margins. Regulatory tightening was evident with Nepal Rastra Bank penalizing financial institutions and the Insurance Authority revising foreign employment fund rules. Simultaneously, Facebook faces a registration ultimatum, while Durga Prasai’s multi-billion-rupee loan default case underscores growing scrutiny of corporate misconduct. On the legislative front, the government introduced a bill restricting Everest climbs without prior experience and restructured taxi service standards. Meanwhile, infrastructure remains a mixed picture—rapid bridge construction in Saptari contrasts with chronic delays in Achham and Bajura. In trade and investment, local goods from Humla found markets in China, and Koshi Province reached out to Indian investors. Similarly, the NRNA Australia pledged investment interest, pending a friendlier climate. Despite having sufficient domestic production, the government controversially approved areca nut imports, raising questions about policy priorities. Other highlights include Sun Nepal Life’s rights share issuance, a capped agriculture budget amid high provincial demands, and calls to upgrade critical road segments affecting tourism. Despite global political shifts, MCC aid to Nepal remains intact, reinforcing continued strategic ties with the U.S. Nepse sees minor uptick after consecutive losses The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a slight rise of 2.08 points (0.07%) on the final trading day of the week, closing at 2,658.02. After four days of steady decline, Thursday saw a mild recovery driven by increased investor activity. Out of the traded companies, shares of 83 firms rose, 161 declined, and one remained unchanged. While most sector indices dropped, the trade index climbed by 17.72 points, hydropower rose by 7.73 points, and investment increased by 2.81 points. Gold prices dropped to NPR 189,600 per tola on Friday, down from NPR 190,600 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver prices held steady at NPR 2,000 per tola. On the global market, gold was trading at approximately USD 3,325 per ounce. Despite a 23.53% decline in international crude oil prices since the start of this fiscal year, the Nepal Oil Corporation has passed on minimal price reductions to consumers while posting profits of NPR 9 billion. Petrol prices have dropped by only 6.43%, while diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel were reduced by 8.75%. The price of cooking gas has remained unchanged. MCC assistance to Nepal unaffected by U.S. political shifts Despite the re-election of Donald Trump and changes in U.S. foreign policy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will continue its support to Nepal. According to Reuters, the Trump administration, under close ally Elon Musk, has ordered the suspension of MCC programs in most countries, except for Nepal and three others. Trump has questioned the effectiveness of such aid programs, arguing against the misuse of American taxpayer funds. Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has issued a one-week ultimatum to Meta (Facebook’s parent company) to register in Nepal. Speaking at a program organized by the National Information Commission, he warned that failure to register would result in a ban. The minister emphasized that Meta earns substantial revenue from Nepal and must comply with tax and regulatory obligations, stating that no foreign corporation can be allowed to bypass national laws. Since the Mothihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline came into operation six years ago, over 57 million kiloliters (5.71 billion liters) of diesel have been imported into Nepal. The Madhesh Regional Office of Nepal Oil Corporation reports that between 1,353 to 3,568 kiloliters are imported daily. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the import volume reached 851,338 kiloliters, with daily imports averaging 2,840 kiloliters in the last fiscal year. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken disciplinary action against five financial institutions for breaching banking norms. These include three development banks—Mukti Nath, Narayani, and Salpa—and two finance companies—Janaki and Pokhara Finance. Among the violations, Mukti Nath’s chairman Bharat Raj Dhakal was found involved in unauthorized construction activities, leading NRB to issue an official warning. For the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Agriculture has capped the budget for new agricultural projects at NPR 1 billion across provincial and local levels. However, proposals from these governments have already exceeded NPR 30 billion. Minister Ramnath Adhikari stated that this ceiling includes funding for rural roads, markets, livestock programs, organic fertilizers, and crop improvement. The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) of Australia has expressed its intention to increase investments in Nepal. In a meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NRNA Australia president Anil Pokhrel emphasized the desire of the Australian NRN community to invest more, provided Nepal ensures an investor-friendly environment. Discussions also included strengthening trade and economic ties, leveraging the investment framework, and enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Nepal Insurance Authority has made a second amendment to the regulations governing the Foreign Employment Group Insurance Fund (PUL). Under the new rule, insurance companies must deposit premium records from the 1st to 15th of each month into the designated bank account by the 1st of the following month. Similar requirements apply to the second half of the month. Insurance companies must also submit details of claims and premium receipts to the fund manager, who must confirm the transactions. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has introduced new national standards for taxi services under the “National Standards for Vehicles Used as Taxis 2081,” replacing those of 2076. The updated classification divides taxis into three categories—Ordinary, Deluxe, and Luxury—based on features like size, performance, and amenities. These rules apply to all taxis, including existing and newly registered ones. A proposed provision in the new Tourism Bill 2081 bars individuals from attempting Mount Everest unless they have previously summited a 7,000-meter Himalayan peak. The bill, registered in the National Assembly by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, also requires climbers to submit health certificates. Those deemed medically unfit will be barred from mountaineering or joining climbing teams. This bill will replace the Tourism Act of 2035 B.S. At the Nepal-India Partnership Summit held in Purnia, Bihar, the Koshi Province Committee of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) encouraged Indian investors to consider projects in the province. Committee president Mukesh Upadhyay highlighted investment potential in tourism, agriculture, and other sectors. The event was held in collaboration with organizations like the Sub-Himalayan Research Institute and the Nepal-India Centre. Sun Nepal Life Insurance Company is set to issue 27% rights shares, totaling 10,696,320 shares at NPR 100 per share. The total value of the issue is NPR 1.07 billion. Shareholders recorded by Baishakh 4 are eligible to apply during the open window from Baishakh 30 to Jestha 19. Nepal SBI Merchant Banking is managing the rights issuance. The Gandaki chapter of the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) has urged the government to expedite improvements along the Narayanghat-Butwal section of the East-West Highway. Chairman Hariprasad Sharma Gaire stated that delays in upgrading the road have caused significant hardship for both tourists and locals, with ongoing dust and mud making travel unpleasant. The government has permitted the import of over 11,000 tons of areca nut for the next six months, even though local production—estimated at 14,500 tons annually—is sufficient. Critics argue that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies yielded to pressure from interest groups, especially after scrapping the import quota system last month. Six bridges have been completed in Saptari within the first nine months of the current fiscal year, and seven others are nearing completion, according to the Lahan Road Division Office. Chief Ashutosh Karna said that while load testing remains pending, these efforts aim to expand road infrastructure in the district. Notable projects include bridges on the Ghode Daha River and along the Rajbiraj-Chhinnamasta road. Despite allocating NPR 3.57 billion for 13 road projects in Achham and Bajura, delays persist across 14 out of 19 contracts awarded by the Infrastructure Development Office. Among these, two are designated as provincial pride projects. So far, NPR 1.89 billion has been spent, with NPR 573 million allocated for the current year. Deadline extensions have not resolved construction delays. Local producers in Humla have successfully exported traditional food products to Taklakot, China, under a cross-border trade agreement. Mukunda Rokaya, an entrepreneur from Simkot Municipality-6, reported that the initial shipment—featuring millet and buckwheat flour, walnut oil, and more—generated NPR 1.8 million in revenue. Controversial businessman and healthcare entrepreneur Durga Prasai is being investigated for loan defaults totaling over NPR 7 billion, related to three of his projects. Previously known for leading anti-loan repayment protests, Prasai now faces allegations of threatening bank officials, including a former NRB governor. He has been taken into police custody as investigations continue.

Title: Special Report: We Are Being Warned That There Will Be Empty Shelves Throughout The U.S. “Starting In A Couple Of Weeks”

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Experts are telling us that the supply chain disruptions that we are facing are likely to be more severe than anything that we witnessed during the last pandemic. Anyone that believes that we can easily replace 438 billion dollars of imports from China is just being delusional. There are thousands of products that are made in China that are simply not made anywhere else. Yes, we will do what we can to mitigate the damage, but there is only so much that we can do. I just heard from one business owner that has already received numerous price increase notifications from his suppliers. And apparently there are already hundreds of products on Amazon that have had their prices raised substantially… Amazon merchants are hiking prices for everything from diaper bags and refrigerator magnets to charm necklaces and other top-selling items as they confront higher import costs. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29% in categories, including clothing, jewelry, household items, office supplies, electronics and toys. In many other cases, products that are manufactured in China will no longer be coming to the United States at all. In fact, President Trump is even admitting that most Chinese businesses “won’t do any business here” as long as tariff rates remain this high… Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently that no one thinks the current status quo with China is sustainable. The president was asked by Time if he agrees with that sentiment. “Oh I agree,” Mr. Trump responded. He said China “won’t do any business here, because at 145%, it’s going to be very rare that you see business.” Nobody can deny that President Trump is quite correct about this, and the numbers that we are already seeing are quite staggering. For example, it is being reported that the “volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%”… US businesses began scaling back or canceling orders as President Trump ratcheted up the trade war with Beijing after returning to the White House. The volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%, compared to the same period last year, according to container-tracking software provider Vizion. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Container bookings for shipments from China to the United States dropped by a staggering 64 percent during the first week of April compared to the previous week… The drop in predicted arrivals at Los Angeles follows reports from data provider Vizion of a “crash” in container bookings in April. For shipments from China to the US, bookings fell 64pc in the first week of the month compared to the previous week. Analysts blamed the crash on importers who were cancelling shipments to “reassess costs, timelines, and broader trade strategy”. This is leaving more container ships half-empty – and prompting more shipping companies to cancel voyages in a bid to reduce losses and stop fees plummeting. Imagine a truck that is speeding along at 70 miles per hour and someone slams the brakes all the way to the floor. That is essentially what we are facing. FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller is warning that trucking activity out of the L.A. area is likely to drop 50 percent and we are likely to see “massive layoffs”… Year-over-year trucking activity out of Los Angeles down 23%. It will likely drop to 50% in the coming weeks if there isn’t trade war resolution. Massive layoffs coming to the West Coast trucking sector The bottom line is that a lot less stuff is going to be coming to our stores. In fact, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council is convinced that “starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff”… Some of the products likeliest to go missing from store shelves in the coming months will be lower-cost footwear, apparel, toys and electronics, for which manufacturing is heavily concentrated in China, Gold said. Other perishable items coming from China, like apple juice and fish, have limited shelf lives and were more difficult for retailers to stockpile. “Like back during Covid where we had shortages of toilet paper, we are going to start seeing that in more and more goods,” said Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “Starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff, and if the administration waits to resolve the problem until we have shortages and hoarding, that is just too late.” His assessment was echoed by an expert that was interviewed by the New York Post… China accounts for about 54% of all US containerized imports from Asia – from electronics, toys, apparel, furniture and building materials. It generally takes two to three weeks to make the journey from China to the West Coast ports. “Things that can’t be inventoried, you’ll see (shortages) in a matter of weeks, maybe not even months,” Rita McGrath, strategic management scholar and professor at Columbia Business School, told The Post. And the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot essentially told President Trump the same thing… Earlier this week, America’s most powerful retail executives trooped into the White House to deliver a blunt prognosis: tariffs on Chinese goods risked causing “empty shelves” in two weeks without a change of course. The three companies who attended the meeting – Walmart, Target and Home Depot – are among the most exposed to the president’s policies, which include tariffs of up to 145pc on Chinese goods and higher port fees for Chinese-made vessels. We are heading into a full-blown nightmare. Even if the U.S. and China were to reach a trade deal tomorrow, and that is definitely not going to happen, it would still take an extended period of time before our supply chains returned to normal… Even if Trump were to reduce the tariffs, the disruption caused to the supply chain could take weeks or months to unravel, given the time it takes for ships to across the Pacific and for the other pieces of the supply chain to snap back into place. “You have an eight-week period where volumes are going to crash before they can even come back up, and that’s if things return to normal,” said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight and Analytics. “All this comes at a time of the year when volumes really should start to increase.” For now, it appears that the Chinese are digging in for the long haul. On Friday, we learned that China’s Politburo has decided to implement a plan to assist those that are being impacted by the trade war… In an economic-analysis meeting on Friday, the 24-man Politburo, China’s main decision-making body headed by President Xi Jinping, said authorities would roll out specific plans to support companies and individuals affected by the trade war. They pledged to “coordinate domestic economic work with international economic and trade engagements, resolutely focus on doing our own affairs, steadfastly expand high-level opening up, and focus on stabilizing employment, businesses, markets, and expectations”, according to a meeting readout released by Xinhua. “By enhancing the certainty of high-quality development, we can effectively respond to the uncertainties brought by drastic changes in the external environment,” it said. Here in the United States, those that are getting hammered by the trade war are just going to have to deal with it. This is a really bad time for this to happen. Economic conditions were already starting to slow down, and a major conflict with Iran could erupt at any time. It is often said that when it rains, it pours. It is definitely raining now, and if the U.S. and China cannot reach a deal soon we are going to get absolutely soaked.

RECAP: Asian shares rose yesterday in line with a global relief rally as trade tensions cooled and US Federal Reserve officials indicated they would be open to cutting interest rates earlier than anticipated. The SET index moved in a range of 1,127.46 and 1,161.03 points this week, before closing yesterday at 1,159.00, up 0.7% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 34.94 billion baht. NEWSMAKERS: US President Donald Trump has signalled a potential U-turn in his trade war with China amid continued market volatility, saying the high tariffs on Chinese goods will "come down substantially, but it won't be zero". COMING UP: On Monday, France releases employment data. On Tuesday, the US releases consumer confidence and job openings updates, and China reports manufacturing PMI. On Wednesday, Germany reports first-quarter GDP and updated inflation data; the US releases quarterly GDP and crude oil inventories, and the Bank of Japan announces interest rate decision. STOCKS TO WATCH: InnovestX Securities says that if the Thai policy interest rate is cut next week, it could provide positive sentiment for stocks, in addition to the expected boost when Thai ESGX funds begin trading on May 2. However, ongoing uncertainty about US-China trade is a concern. As well, Q1 earnings of large listed companies are starting to arrive, which may introduce further volatility. Recommended stocks are BDMS with a fundamental target price of 32 baht, CPF (30 baht) and BCP (47 baht). TECHNICAL VIEW: InnovestX Securities sees support at 1,120 points and resistance at 1,190. Kasikorn Securities sees support at 1,130 points and resistance at 1,160.

April 25, 2025 13:50 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed Friday, leading shares of several other adtech and AI stocks higher, after showing signs of success with AI features. Alphabet's Class A shares jumped over 4% to just above $166, before paring gains in recent trading. Shares of several other tech companies in digital advertising that use AI tools also gained, including Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and AppLovin (APP). (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) The Google parent reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings Thursday, with CEO Sundar Pichai telling investors Google Search growth was driven by "engagement we're seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" in just under a year since its launch. Several analysts, including those at Citi and Wedbush, boosted their price targets for the stock in the wake of the results, pointing to its AI potential. Bank of America analysts, who also raised their price target, said they believe Wall Street "may be underappreciating" opportunities tied to search features like AI Overviews and AI-driven cloud demand. That trend could suggest more growth for other companies with cloud and digital ad businesses, with several set to report earnings in the coming weeks. Snap is scheduled to report next Tuesday, with Meta and cloud giant Microsoft set to follow Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. AppLovin is scheduled to release results the following Wednesday, May 7, with Pinterest's report due a day later.

Title: Copycat Ozempic makers just lost a big court fight

A federal judge in Texas handed Novo Nordisk (NVO+4.01%) a big win late Thursday in its battle against cheaper versions of its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, rejecting a bid by compounding pharmacies to keep making the drugs while a legal challenge moves forward. In a sealed order U.S. Judge Mark Pittman denied a request for preliminary injunction a trade group representing compounding pharmacies that would have prevented the Food and Drug Administration from taking action against its members for making knock-off versions using semaglutide, the active ingredient in the weight loss drugs. Small-scale compounders must now immediately stop making their versions of Ozempic and Wegovy. Larger, federally licensed compounders have until May 22 to keep producing the copycats. The popular drugs had been in short supply for some two years, which led the FDA to declare a shortage, thus allowing pharmacists to legally make compounded versions of the patented medications. Many telehealth companies also jumped into the market with compounded drugs. However, in February the FDA determined that the semaglutide shortage was over, leading to the lawsuit by Outsourcing Facilities Association. “We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders’ attempts to undermine FDA’s data-based decision that the shortage of Wegovy® and Ozempic® is resolved,” said Steve Benz, Corporate Vice President, Legal and U.S. General Counsel, Novo Nordisk in an statement. He said that the company will continue driving legal actions forward “and escalate our efforts as necessary, while closely engaging with regulators and law enforcement.” Compounding pharmacies make drugs tailored to individual prescriptions for a specific patient and are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. Eli Lilly (LLY+1.39%) has also taken aggressive legal action against compounding pharmacies, and on Wednesday filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies that offer cheaper versions of its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.

All rights reserved by Germán & Co. Reproduction is strictly prohibited. By Germán & Co. Karlstad, Sweden | April 25, 2025 ________________________________________ The transformation of our relationship with news resembles the shift from voyaging on a sailing ship to piloting a supersonic jet. In the age of handwritten letters and horse-drawn mail coaches, news travelled like vessels charting ancient sea routes: steadily, predictably, with ample time for fact and rumour to be sifted before docking at the harbour of public consciousness. A letter from distant kin might take months to cross continents, and each word it bore was treasured with patience—information was scarce and therefore sacred. Today, we navigate a “digital Macondo hyperocean,” where, instead of one carefully composed missive, we are submerged in an unending torrent of fragments clamouring for our attention. News no longer passes through traditional verification customs; anyone may cast a message, like a piece of paper, into a bottle—into the cyber sea of Macondo—and millions may retrieve its contents simultaneously. Rather than a single official bulletin, the modern “port authorities”—governments and institutions—issue manifold and often contradictory communiqués. We inhabit a dishonest realm where every statement drifts under suspicion of falsehood. ________________________________________ In those forgotten years when the postal carriers—uniforms as strict as their expressions—imposed order upon the wilderness of streets with their mystic system of numbers, the world possessed a rigidity that made it legible. Even digits divided the righteous from the sinners: evens to the right, odds to the left. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had yet to witness the seventeen artificial roses that would blossom from his blood in the plaza, and the gypsy Melquíades had not yet returned with his parchments of miracles. Now we wander like blind men through a labyrinth of our design, our fingertips raw from brushing against walls that shift by the hour. We yearn for the certainty that once guided letters from lover to beloved across impossible distances, yet the compass needle spins madly, mocking our desperation. The boundary between right and left has dissolved like sugar in the bitter coffee of existence—a minor tragedy beside the greater dissolution that follows. In this perpetual twilight, white no longer stands apart from black, nor light from shadow. The grey mist that descended upon Macondo during those five years of unrelenting rain has settled permanently in our souls. We peer at moral questions through their haze, unable to discern their accurate outline, while ancestral ghosts whisper counsel that fades before we can grasp it. And here lies the most terrible revelation—an heirloom of despair passed down through generations: we have forfeited even the sacred right to choose. Our freedom languishes in the same distant chamber where undeliverable letters are heaped, forgotten in dusty corners where lamps never glimmer. The illusion of choice gleams before us like the golden fish Úrsula once dreamed of, always visible yet forever beyond reach, condemned to circle in waters too deep for our understanding. If we remember when we complained about the postal service, we did so because we did not know what the future would bring; it was impossible to imagine that ZIP codes would impose order on chaos and that envelopes—sealed with a quick lick and a spark of hope—would carry our faith across continents. The postal network, conceived by visionary officials and traced daily by letter carriers who mapped the world with every route, served as an invisible compass: a shared spell through which nations unable to understand one another knew precisely how to be found. Indeed, in every odd-numbered address lay a promise, in every even number, a certainty. ________________________________________ But now, adrift in a present that reeks of stale hand sanitiser and cables severed by tariff wars, we grope blindly through shattered coordinates. Postal routes, once sacred, have been replaced by supply chains that snap like threads of spittle in a dying man’s mouth. The Universal Postal Union, which in glorious times stitched together continents like the points of a single love letter, lies in tatters, replaced by a masquerade in which trade powers recite lies in diplomatic accents. In this deracinated age—a world without fixed coordinates, where addresses dissolve like salt in rain—there are no saviours in postal uniforms, no envelopes bearing redemption. The mailman’s whistle has gone silent, replaced by the hollow reverberation of footsteps that never arrive, never depart. They linger as spectres in the dust, those echoes: false promises of connection, of permanence. Empires crumble on schedule. Tyrants rot. Rebels in overalls, clutching Orwell’s tattered manifesto, rise from furrows only to inherit the same rot they sought to burn. History is not a straight road but a ouroboros, its jaws clamped tight on its tail, spinning the earth into a dizzying gyre of repetition. We exist in the parenthesis between ruin and renaissance, scribbling our names on air, sending letters to a future that rewrites itself endlessly. There is no fixed point, no destination—only the ceaseless orbit, the Sisyphean march, the myth of progress unravelling like a frayed postal route into the void. ________________________________________ Late last week, the Financial Times reported that President Vladimir Putin had “generously” offered to freeze Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at whatever line most suited Moscow. The pitch was whispered to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s self‑styled envoy—during a meet‑and‑greet in St Petersburg. Never mind the optics: who better than a property developer to broker peace between armies? Washington, meanwhile, floated the notion of gifting Crimea to Russia and turning a polite blind eye while four more regions stayed under occupation. Voilà—peace! The proposal was trumpeted as the Kremlin’s first “formal” softening in three years, and some Western headlines applauded Putin’s "restraint" as though brutality measured in half‑steps were magnanimity. Less enchanted, European diplomats warned that the offer was likely bait: a showy concession designed to tether Trump to deeper Russian demands. Still, the story rolled on—amplified by Bloomberg, cross‑stitched by Swedish reporting, and wallpapered across the 24‑hour news feeds. Back home, President Trump’s standing was buckling. A Supreme Court setback and the worst poll numbers of his career formed the backdrop to the St Petersburg overture. Into that vacuum stepped The Mirror, gleefully quoting Trump, labelling Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" during a sour White House clash—footage Russian broadcasters replayed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ________________________________________ In a tableau torn from Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, a handful of nimble traders—moral compasses rattling like Raskolnikov’s heartbeat—scooped up billions on a toy‑company stock that whiplashed with every tariff tweet—sí, te quiero, poquito, nada: tariff on at noon, tariff off by dusk—while the broader energy sector bled nearly $150 billion in market value over the same 48‑hour whiplash—Brent futures slid 7 percent, the XLE energy ETF sank 6.2 percent, ExxonMobil alone vaporised roughly $22 billion in market cap, Chevron $18 billion, and the European duo of BP and Shell a further $25 billion. Clean‑energy names fared no better—ICLN (the global clean‑energy ETF) sank 8 per cent, First Solar erased $4 billion, Enphase another $3 billion, while Vestas and Ørsted together shed roughly €6 billion—altogether about $35 billion in green‑power market cap evaporated. Nor did Big Tech escape the downdraft: the so‑called Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla—collectively shed roughly $350 billion in market value during the same two‑day window (Apple − $80 billion, Microsoft − $70 billion, Nvidia − $60 billion, Amazon − $45 billion, Alphabet − $40 billion, Meta − $30 billion, Tesla − $25 billion). In the market’s brutal zero‑sum arithmetic, one player’s windfall is another’s ruin. This time, the crater opened beneath ordinary pension funds—state teachers’ and firefighters’ plans with heavy XLE exposure surrendered an estimated $9 billion in paper value. When you roll in police, municipal‑worker, and federal Thrift Savings allocations, public‑sector pension systems saw roughly $27 billion vanish inside two trading sessions. ________________________________________ Enter, stage left, the indispensable Mr. Dmitry Peskov—because what self‑respecting Kremlin melodrama would dare proceed without its dapper master of ceremonies? A career diplomat‑turned‑spin‑doctor, he glides through marble corridors brandishing a résumé as glossy as a freshly lacquered nesting doll: fluent in English, Turkish, French, and Arabic (thank you, MGIMO—Russia’s Hogwarts for budding power‑brokers), a formative posting in Ankara, and a society‑page marriage to Olympic ice‑dance diva Tatiana Navka. The man even sports a clipped Oxford accent, as if the Queen herself had coached him between caviar courses. And of course, this week’s Absolutely‑Limited‑Time Offer™—pitched with the grin of a duty‑free perfume hawker and the menace of a Bond villain—features: 🌹 One (1) Romanov‑era Fabergé egg—nothing whispers “trust me” like jewel‑encrusted poultry. 🌹 Lifetime first‑dibs on rare‑earth contracts—corner the battery market while saving the planet (fine print rendered in invisible ink). 🌹 Billions in natural‑gas sweetheart deals—blue flame, red tape, green cash. 🌹 And—crash the cymbals—the shimmering hallucination of a TRUMP KREMLIN TOWER®, stabbing the Moscow skyline and powered exclusively by Gazprom gratitude. The Moscow Times calls this glittering hamper “bait” to reel in Donald Trump; Peskov, ever the courteous angler, insists they are merely “areas of mutual economic opportunity.” Happy birthday, democracy—your cake is Fabergé, the candles burn methane, and the guest of honour just sold the bakery. The pièce de résistance? A February 10 executive order pausing enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for 180 days “in the interests of national security.” Just in time to clear the path for all those mutual opportunities. ________________________________________ In memory of Pope Francis—the man of humility, inclusion, and the migrant—hailed, astonishingly, by both Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian leader of the Russian state, and Donald Trump, the former and current President of the United States, as though concord itself had sprouted wings. Their unlikely agreement in praising the pontiff bridged ideological chasms, creating a rare moment when these two powerful heads of state found common ground in their admiration for a man who consistently advocated for the vulnerable and marginalized.

Reproduction is strictly prohibited. The controversy surrounding the Trump administration's halt of Equinor's Empire Wind 1 project has intensified this week. New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit challenging the Interior Department's decision, arguing it violates federal administrative procedures and established permitting protocols. Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups and labour unions has announced plans for nationwide protests against what they describe as "politically motivated energy policy reversals." Secretary Burgum defended the administration's position in a press conference on Tuesday, stating that all offshore wind projects are under review to ensure "economic viability and energy security." Ørsted announced a strategic review of its U.S. operations in response to the current regulatory climate, potentially delaying additional offshore wind investments. Meanwhile, in Europe, Finland has joined Sweden and Italy in accelerating nuclear power development, announcing plans to extend the operating licenses of its existing reactors and streamline approvals for new small modular reactor technologies. This week, the International Energy Agency released a report indicating that global renewable energy installations continue to grow slower than projected in specific markets due to policy uncertainties, supply chain constraints, and inflationary pressures. Crude oil markets experienced significant volatility this week, with prices rebounding slightly following last week's sharp decline. Brent crude settled at $72.40 per barrel on Thursday, up 3.2% from last week's three-year low, as markets reassessed the impact of China's retaliatory tariffs. On Wednesday, OPEC+ ministers held an emergency virtual meeting to discuss market conditions but maintained their current production strategy. ExxonMobil announced a $12 billion investment in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas development, citing the administration's supportive stance toward domestic fossil fuel production. Similarly, Chevron has reactivated previously paused drilling projects in the Permian Basin. Several automakers are reconsidering their U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing investments following the administration's rollback of federal incentives. Ford announced it will delay the planned expansion of its Tennessee battery plant by at least 18 months. General Motors is reportedly reviewing the timeline for transitioning certain production lines to EVs at its Michigan facilities. BYD broke ground on its first European manufacturing facility in Hungary this week, accelerating its international expansion despite growing trade tensions. The facility will produce battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles primarily for European markets. Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, reversed its technical staff and granted preliminary approval for Petrobras to drill near the Amazon River mouth, sparking protests in Brasília and criticism from environmental organisations. President Lula defended the decision as "necessary for Brazil's energy sovereignty" while promising additional ecological safeguards. India's Power Ministry announced new grid integration measures to accommodate both coal expansion and growing renewable capacity, acknowledging the country's dual strategy will continue through the decade. The announcement came as parts of northern India experienced rolling blackouts amid an early heat wave. Energy sector stocks have shown divergent performance this week, with fossil fuel companies generally gaining while clean energy shares declined. The S&P Global Clean Energy Index fell 3.2% over the week, while the S&P 500 Energy Sector index rose 2.1%. Analysts attribute this pattern to anticipated policy shifts favouring conventional energy sources. Natural gas prices in the U.S. rose to a six-month high following forecasts of warmer-than-average temperatures across much of the country, increasing cooling demand expectations. European gas prices remained stable as storage levels continue to exceed seasonal averages. The markets are closely watching next week's Federal Reserve meeting for signals about interest rate trajectories, which could significantly impact energy investment patterns through the remainder of 2025. 📌 U.S. Climate and Energy Policy Reuters – "NY files legal challenge against Trump administration's Empire Wind halt" (April 23, 2025) Bloomberg – "Burgum defends energy policy amid mounting offshore wind controversy" (April 22, 2025) Politico – "Environmental groups plan nationwide protests over wind project cancellations" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Renewable Energy and Nuclear Power Financial Times – "Ørsted announces strategic review of US operations amid policy uncertainty" (April 21, 2025) World Nuclear News – "Finland accelerates nuclear development plan to meet carbon goals" (April 22, 2025) IEA – "Renewable Energy Market Update – April 2025" (April 20, 2025) 📌 Fossil Fuel Markets and Investment S&P Global – "Oil prices rebound from three-year lows as market reassesses China tariff impact" (April 24, 2025) Reuters – "OPEC+ holds emergency meeting, maintains production strategy" (April 23, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "ExxonMobil announces $12B Gulf of Mexico investment push" (April 23, 2025) Energy Intelligence – "Chevron restarts paused Permian drilling projects" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Electric Vehicle Market Dynamics Automotive News – "Ford delays Tennessee battery plant expansion amid EV incentive uncertainty" (April 22, 2025) Reuters – "GM reviewing EV transition timeline for Michigan facilities" (April 23, 2025) Financial Times – "BYD begins construction on first European manufacturing plant" (April 21, 2025) 📌 Geopolitical Energy Developments Reuters – "Brazil's Ibama approves Amazon drilling despite staff recommendations" (April 22, 2025) Estado de São Paulo – "Environmental protesters gather in Brasília following Amazon drilling decision" (April 23, 2025) Economic Times – "India announces new grid integration measures amid northern blackouts" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Economic and Market Trends Bloomberg – "Clean energy stocks slide as fossil fuels rally on policy expectations" (April 24, 2025) CNBC – "Natural gas prices hit six-month high on warming forecasts" (April 24, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "Energy investors eye Fed meeting for interest rate signals" (April 25, 2025) No discussions yet.

Title: It Is The Era Of Great Detachment: Time For A New Management Playbook

ByAnjali Chaudhry ByAnjali Chaudhry, Contributor. Isometric group of businessmen carrying piles of documents in cardboard boxes left the office, ... More unemployment, dismissal, career crisis, economic crisis leading to massive layoffs It’s a precarious time to be a manager in today’s workforce. Nearly 200,000 employees have been laid off in just weeks—a number not seen since the 2020 recession—due to sweeping efficiency mandates from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The latest workplace trend, dubbed “What did you do last week?”, pushes productivity into short, tangible bursts, leaving little room for meaningful and substantive work. Layered atop this is an unrelenting news cycle filled with tariff wars, geopolitical instability, and economic headwinds. Unsurprisingly, Glassdoor reports the lowest employee confidence index since tracking began in 2016. Gallup data reinforces the sentiment: employee engagement is at a decade low. Experts now call it the era of Great Detachment. Decades of research show that disengagement leads to lower quality work, reduced safety, and decreased profitability. In this climate, managers are in a double bind, between efficiency mandates and employee expectations. On the one hand, they are the foot soldiers having to implement the strident call for efficiency while being constrained by the lack of support or training. On the other hand, they must manage employee expectations that are stuck in the post-pandemic era. One of the very first executive orders terminated remote work arrangements in the federal government. Many businesses across industries including behemoths such as Amazon, JP Morgan, and AT&T followed suit with their own return to office mandates. Yet, employee preferences tell a different story. Remote work preference has jumped from 8% to 33% since 2019. Meanwhile, only 7% now prefer onsite work—down from 60%. These numbers reflect a major disconnect that managers are forced to reconcile, often without tools or autonomy. To answer the pressing questions—How do I motivate employees? How can I encourage innovation amidst uncertainty?—leaders must start by restoring a sense of agency in their teams. Today’s workforce is teeming with diversity—not just in demographics but in terms of what employees want, need, or even expect. The psychological contract between employer and employee is more idiosyncratic than ever making a ‘one-size fit all’ management style a very bad idea. Rather than making unilateral assumptions about what will work, it is time to engage with the employee one-on-one. Having an open and honest dialogue has always been a hallmark of a good manager. For those wondering how, two promising techniques worth investing in are active listening and appreciative enquiry. Active listening calls for demonstrating empathy and genuine interest and thus creating safe space for employees to share what they need to succeed. Appreciative enquiry is about engaging in dialogues that begin with exploring what is working and then, supporting employee to build on it. Being authentic is the key. A week-to-week accountability model creates pressure to convey busyness and deliver quick wins. Managers need to buck the trend for efficiency demands as thus avoid the cycle of “performative productivity” for employees. Instead, empower employees to prioritize meaningful work—activities that drive long-term value even if they don’t yield immediate results. Easier said than done, yes, but prioritizing employee productivity that goes beyond the optics is a win-win as it delivers value for the organization while signaling to employee that their contribution matters. Managers not as a boss but becoming what employees need, want, and expect. Today’s managers are squeezed between the top-down pressures of leadership and the bottom-up expectations of their teams. And yet, their success hinges on how their employee perform. In this new era, traditional management roles no longer suffice. To help employees do well, it behooves managers to transition from being 'Da Boss’ to becoming what employees need. Become an Agile Coach. The AI revolution is reshaping employee skill sets needed for organizations to innovate and stay competitive. Managers should partner with employees to identify gaps and create personalized development plans. This reskilling may call for supporting employees in carving out time for self-training, for sourcing learning opportunities, or connecting them to programs from educational institutions or industry groups. Serve as a Guide and Cheerleader. In environments where layoffs loom, many employees struggle to articulate their value. Be a spokesperson who brings employee challenges and concerns to leadership just as you can help amplify their contributions and offer visibility that go beyond short-term KPIs. Recalibrate Expectations and Model Resilience. Sometimes, tough love is necessary. If teamwork or long-term thinking is being undervalued in today’s ‘what’s in it for me’ mindset, it’s the manager’s job to recalibrate values and re-center collaboration. Employees look to their managers for guidance when there is ambiguity and therefore, modeling behaviors your employees need to thrive may be vital. In these uncertain times, what employee may need the most is a leader who conveys resilience, strength, and positivity. Myth of work-life balance as businessman lay down working at home using laptop and headset for ... More conference call meeting and take care his daughter child playing with cat In today’s always-on world, Employees report being perpetually in a crunch mode with long hours, unrelenting urgency and being constantly checked in. Burnout is rampant, not from lack of time off, but from the inability to truly disconnect. The busyness of work that begins as a badge of honor results significant burnout that chokes individual’s productivity. For a long time, work-life balance was viewed as a panacea. However, in today’s hyper-connected world, the idea of balance is viewed as being unrealistic and can makes things worse by setting unreasonable expectations. So, instead of work-life balance, consider the concept of work-life boundary that makes a case for clear demarcation between work and non-work lives. Boundaries can be time-bound such as the traditional 9 to 5 workday, or psychological, as in checking out mentally from the job demands to focus on personal life or even emotional, that is, a taking a break from the stresses and strain of work demands. Unfortunately, employees often lack the ability or the autonomy to engage in any of these boundary controls. Managers can help. It could mean respecting employee’s preference for personal time, empowering employees to develop a more structured work-life, or modeling behaviors that give autonomy to the employees to take a break from work. Championing and enabling work-life boundary may be key to fostering a culture of well-being where reducing anxiety, burnout, and stress is a priority. A Gallup study of Fortune 500 CHROs revealed a critical blind spot: while most expect their employees to prefer blended work-life models, almost half of the surveyed employee actually prefer clear separation. This mismatch is a silent driver of disengagement—and a unique opportunity for managers to lead differently and win employee trust by giving them autonomy to manage their preference for work-life boundary. Admittedly not all job types allow accommodating employee desire for boundary control. For instance, a 9 to 5 work routine is not an option in healthcare setting but being open and approachable to helping employees figure out strategies for crafting their work arrangement can significantly help support hyper-stressed and over-worked employees. Two decades ago, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard penned Let My People Go Surfing, advocating for flexible time away from work. Despite generous PTO policies, a 2024 Harris Poll found that 75% of U.S. employees don’t use their allotted time off. Why? Pressure to stay connected, fear of job insecurity, and mounting workloads. Today, burnout is at crisis levels. While extended vacations may be impractical during economic downturns, the core idea remains relevant: managers must champion employee well-being to sustain performance. Productivity mandates and efficiency targets may be essential—but they must not come at the cost of human creativity and resilience. Restoring employee agency is not just a feel-good strategy. It’s a competitive advantage. Leaders who listen, advocate, coach, and set boundaries aren’t just surviving the Great Detachment—they're building the kind of workplace where innovation and engagement thrive, even in turbulent times.

Title: SpaceX Tries to Poke Holes in Rival AST SpaceMobile's Next-Gen Satellite Plans

SpaceX is criticizing rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to test a next-generation satellite, arguing that the company’s proposal is flawed and potentially threatens orbital safety. In a Thursday letter to the FCC, SpaceX urged the agency to ensure that "enormous experimental satellites" follow the rules. The FCC is weighing whether to grant an experimental license so AST SpaceMobile can test a larger, more powerful version of its BlueBird satellite. This "FM-1" satellite spans 223 square meters, making it about three times larger than AST's first-gen BlueBird satellites, five of which are currently in orbit. The FM-1 is important since AST aims to launch and operate a fleet of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity for carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. AST is also facing a tight timeline since its partners want to begin offering satellite connectivity to customers as soon as next year. Although SpaceX doesn’t oppose the FM-1 satellite itself, the company has gripes with AST SpaceMobile’s proposal. In its letter to the FCC, SpaceX argues the “experimental license application for the FM-1 satellite contains worrying discrepancies in its orbital debris mitigation plan that require clarification before granting authorization to launch.” The discrepancies include how AST says the FM-1 satellite will be retired in 2.9 years by burning up in the Earth’s atmosphere once the satellite’s mission is complete. SpaceX’s analysis, using NASA software, claims the satellite will orbit the planet for 6.6 years after it completes its mission, violating the FCC’s disposal rule for low-Earth orbiting satellites. In addition, SpaceX claims “the actual collision probability of the FM-1 satellite is close to ten times higher than AST reports,” when other satellites, rocket pieces, and space debris orbit at the same altitude. “Strikingly, AST makes no effort to explain how it can mitigate the harm the ‘largest commercial phased array antenna in LEO’ will cause for optical astronomy,” the letter adds. (That said, AST has been working with the scientific community to address the potential astronomy interference.) SpaceX has become more vocal in attacking AST when both are developing cellular satellite services. In its letter, SpaceX stresses that AST’s new satellite follows the same requirements the company faced when the FCC authorized its second-generation Starlink satellites. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in October, the company accused SpaceX of using anti-competitive tactics to “intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators.” In the meantime, the FCC told AST last week that its application for the FM-1 satellite was "incomplete," and sent AST 10 questions, which AST has until April 15 to address. The FM-1 satellite is currently slated to launch in July, a delay from Q2. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): YouTube tests AI Overviews carousel in search results. YouTube is experimenting with an AI Overviews feature that surfaces short clips from videos deemed most relevant to a user's search query. Available only to a small number of US-based YouTube Premium users, the AI-generated highlights are presented in a carousel format within search results. The test applies only to select English-language queries related to product research or travel. This feature mirrors the controversial AI Overviews in Google Search, which have been linked to declining site traffic. Importance for marketers: If widely deployed, AI Overviews could reduce visibility and video views, affecting branded content discoverability on YouTube. Trump signs executive order launching AI education initiative. President Trump has issued an executive order establishing a national AI education initiative and a new White House Task Force on AI Education. The order directs resources toward AI training in schools, teacher development, and an AI-focused Presidential Challenge. Despite recent cuts to the Department of Education, the administration aims to prioritize AI in discretionary grants and research. The initiative's success will depend on cross-sector collaboration and effective coordination across government departments. Importance for marketers: Broader AI literacy and workforce readiness could accelerate AI adoption across industries, influencing future demand for AI-based marketing solutions and services. Google finds UK workers can save 122 hours a year using AI for admin tasks. Google's AI Works pilot program in the UK showed that workers—especially older women in lower-income roles—can save 122 hours annually using AI for administrative tasks. Simple interventions like training and "permission to prompt" doubled AI usage among participants. The study suggests AI adoption barriers include legitimacy concerns and lack of confidence. With minor training, weekly AI usage rose from 17% to 56%. Google estimates AI adoption could add £400 billion to the UK economy. Importance for marketers: Demonstrates measurable time savings and the importance of upskilling, with implications for marketing operations and productivity improvements. Baidu launches cheaper, upgraded AI models to stay competitive. Baidu introduced two improved versions of its Ernie chatbot—Ernie 4.5 Turbo and Ernie X1 Turbo—at significantly reduced cost. The Ernie 4.5 Turbo model is now 80% cheaper than its predecessor, while the reasoning-focused X1 Turbo is 50% less expensive. The move comes amid rising competition from Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Zhipu AI, as well as global leaders like OpenAI. Baidu's share price rose after the announcement. Importance for marketers: Lower pricing and improved performance from Chinese AI providers could increase global adoption, reduce costs for marketers, and spark competitive pricing shifts across the industry.

Importance for marketers: Native shopping in ChatGPT could open a powerful new sales channel, enabling frictionless AI-assisted buying journeys and direct product exposure for Shopify merchants. Investor claims AI is already replacing workers—especially in law and HR. VC Victor Lazarte claims AI is "fully replacing people," particularly in legal and HR roles. Critics point to recent courtroom mishaps involving flawed AI-generated legal documents as evidence that the technology isn't ready. Meanwhile, biased hiring AI continues to disadvantage certain job seekers. Importance for marketers: The rhetoric around AI replacement may shape how companies evaluate automation tools. Marketers must balance AI use with brand reputation, ethics, and accuracy—especially in regulated or people-centric sectors. Meta expands AI assistant access on Ray-Ban smart glasses in Europe. Meta is rolling out its Meta AI assistant to Ray-Ban smart glasses users in seven European countries. The AI can respond to voice prompts, offer translations, and identify real-world objects.

IMF: AI's economic gains will outweigh emissions costs. The IMF estimates AI could boost global GDP by 0.5% annually from 2025–2030, outweighing increased emissions from energy-hungry data centers. Still, the report warns that benefits won't be distributed equally, and urges more sustainable deployment. Importance for marketers: This reinforces the importance of aligning AI innovation with ESG goals. Marketers promoting AI solutions should address sustainability and societal impact to resonate with stakeholders and regulators. YouTube adds AI-generated background music tool for creators. YouTube's new "Music assistant" lets creators generate copyright-free instrumental tracks by entering text prompts. Available to some users of the Creator Music beta, it generates multiple options for download and editing. Importance for marketers: The tool enables fast, legal background music creation for video content, helping brands produce compliant multimedia assets without relying on stock libraries. Creators Guild of America launches legal CGA Rider to protect content creators. The CGA has released a binding "CGA Rider" document that creators can attach to contracts with brands or agencies. It covers content rights, payment terms, revision limits, and AI usage permissions. Several platforms have already adopted it. Importance for marketers: As AI use and content reuse increase, marketers must align with creator rights protections. Using CGA-backed standards helps foster trust and compliance in influencer partnerships. Italian newspaper Il Foglio finds success with AI-written sections. Il Foglio published a daily four-page AI-written section for a month and plans to continue weekly. Editor Claudio Cerasa says AI excels at irony and summarizing books, but lacks critical thinking.

Title: The Meta Trial Shows the Dangers of Selling Out
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/the-meta-trial-shows-the-dangers-of-selling-out/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Meta has a lot at stake in the current FTC lawsuit against it. In theory a negative verdict could result in a company breakup. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg once faced an even bigger existential threat. Back in 2006, his investors and even his employees were pressuring him to sell his two-year-old startup for a quick payoff. Facebook was still a college-based social network, and several companies were interested in buying it. The most serious offer came from Yahoo, which offered a stunning $1 billion. Zuckerberg, though, believed he could grow the company into something worth much more. The pressure was tremendous, and at one point he blinked, agreeing in principle to sell. But immediately after that, a dip in Yahoo stock led its leader at the time, Terry Semel, to ask for a price adjustment. Zuckerberg seized the opportunity to shut down negotiations; Facebook would remain in his hands. “That was by far the most stressful time in my life,” Zuckerberg told me years later. So it’s ironic to observe, through the testimony of this trial, how he treated two other sets of founders in very similar situations to him—but whom he successfully bought out. This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech. The nub of the current FTC trial seems to hinge on how US District Court judge James Boasberg will define Meta’s market—whether it’s limited to social media or, as Meta is arguing, the broader field of “entertainment.” But much of the early testimony exhumed the details of Zuckerberg’s successful pursuit of Instagram and WhatsApp—two companies that, according to the government, are now part of Meta’s illegal monopolistic grip on social media. (The trial also invoked the case of Snap, which resisted Zuckerberg’s $6 billion offer and had to deal with Facebook copying its products.) Legalities aside, the way these companies were upended by a Zuckerberg offer made the first few days of this case a dramatic and instructive study of acquisition dynamics between small and big business. Though almost all of these narratives have been covered at length over the years—I documented them pretty thoroughly in my own 2020 account Facebook: The Inside Story—it was striking to see the principals testifying under oath about what happened. Hey, my sources were pretty good, but I didn’t get to swear them in! In their testimony, star witnesses Zuckerberg and Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom agreed on facts, but their interpretations were Mars and Venus. In 2012, Instagram was about to close a $500 million investment round, when suddenly the tiny company found itself in play, with Facebook in hot pursuit. In an email at the time, Facebook’s CFO asked Zuckerberg if his goal was to “neutralize a potential competitor.” The answer was affirmative. That was not the way he pitched it to Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger. Zuckerberg promised the cofounders they would control Instagram and could grow it their way. They would have the best of both worlds—independence and Facebook’s huge resources. Oh, and Facebook’s $1 billion offer was double the valuation of the company in the funding round it was about to close. Everything worked great for a few years, but then Zuckerberg began denying resources to Instagram, which its cofounders had built into a juggernaut. Systrom testified that Zuckerberg seemed envious of Instagram’s success and cultural currency, saying that his boss “believed we were hurting Facebook’s growth.” Zuckerberg’s snubs ultimately drove Instagram's founders to leave in 2018. By that time, Instagram was arguably worth perhaps 100 times Zuckerberg’s purchase price. Systrom and Krieger’s spoils, though considerable, did not reflect the fantastic value they had built for Facebook. The founders of WhatsApp did reap a stratospheric buyout, because in 2014 Zuckerberg threw $19 billion to acquire their then tiny operation. But, as told through testimony of some of its executives and funders, the acquisition hinged on promises that cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum would retain control. The WhatsApp cofounders hated advertising and were adamant that no ads should ever appear on their service. But documents introduced in the trial indicated that Facebook was basing its valuation on the premise that WhatsApp would be monetized, apparently with those despised ads. The founders left in 2018, when it became clear that Zuckerberg was calling the shots. “I espoused a certain set of principles, even publicly, to my users, and I said, Look, we are not gonna sell your data, we are not going to sell you ads, and I turned around and sold my company,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. His penance for this “crime,” he told me, was spending $50 million to create the Signal Foundation. Though these founders were pressured to sell, there weren’t literal guns to their heads—and they did cash out in exchange for pursuing their dreams. So we shouldn’t feel too sorry for them. But lately people in Silicon Valley have been chattering about startup guru Paul Graham’s “Founder Mode” theory, which assumes that the person most responsible for creating a company is the best one to run it—and that the world itself benefits from such people. Zuckerberg, of course, is an iconic founder. But the trial is revealing a narrative beyond the FTC’s legal argument about anticompetitive acquisitions: Zuckerberg’s penchant for snuffing out founders to advance his own goals. Of course, sometimes founders are well advised to take the money and run. Consider the case of Clubhouse, the audio-based social networking product that exploded during the pandemic. Its founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, fended off multiple suitors, including a rumored $4 billion offer from Twitter. But after the pandemic—and some poor strategic choices—the service deflated like a punctured balloon. In 2023 it laid off half of its staff. On the other hand, it’s still around, and at least in one of its recent town halls, Davison still seemed to be having fun. One question that Mark Zuckerberg did not have to answer during his testimony was how he viewed his own transition from prey to predator. But I did pose that question to him during my book research. We were discussing the mental anguish he suffered during the 2006 crisis. Zuckerberg told me that he often advises young founders not to give in to pressure. This advice, of course, was not offered to those running companies he wanted to buy. So I asked him directly—given his lesson from the Yahoo experience, did Systrom and Krieger make a mistake by selling to him? There was a long pause, not an uncommon phenomenon when Zuckerberg considers a question where a candid answer might put him in a damning position. Finally he gave a response that dodged the issue, saying that Instagram could never have reached its heights without Facebook’s support. He said pretty much the same thing in court this month. On a legal basis, Meta will not be judged on how he bought off the dreams of founders, but whether he gamed the marketplace through his purchases. No judge will rule on the calculus of selling off a dream. In Kevin Systrom’s testimony, he opined that Zuckerberg denied resources to Instagram in part out of jealousy. The photo-sharing app, which he didn’t invent, was growing faster than Facebook’s blue app, a Mark Zuckerberg Production. When reporting Facebook: The Inside Story, I became familiar with this tension and put it to Zuckerberg: Was he in fact jealous of the Instagram team? “Jealous…” he repeated. Yes, I said. And that you would prefer growth of Facebook’s Blue app to Instagram’s? He said no, and explained to me how he thought about it. Early on … it made sense to leave the founders alone and let them build their best products. “That was incredibly successful,” he says. “And it made sense for the first five years. But now we’re at the point where all the products are big and important. I don’t want to build just multiple versions of the same product. We should have a more coherent and integrated product strategy.” And if that meant losing founders, so be it. “I can understand if you’re an entrepreneur who built one of those things and had awesome success, you’d wake up and say, ‘Okay, I’m proud of what I did, but this isn’t for me going forward.’ That’s how I see it, and we’re going in the right direction.” Those close to Kevin Systrom, though, believe that had Zuckerberg not asserted control, he would have remained at Instagram for 20 more years. Jim asks, “What was it like interviewing some of the pioneers of modern-day computing for Hackers?” Thanks for the question, Jim. You are asking me to access the feelings I had over 40 years ago when I was talking first-hand to people who are now legends. But in the circles I traveled they were virtually unknown, even computer science pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. And to my knowledge no reporter had documented the world of MIT hackers, who pretty much invented computer culture. I do recall as the interviews accumulated, I came to realize that the story I was telling was significant and would have continuing relevance. Also, some of them outright stretched my mind. These people were so interesting that after the book was published I kept talking to computer folk. I still am. Submit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

Title: Market Volatility And Monday Morning Quarterbacks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2025/04/25/market-volatility-and-monday-morning-quarterbacks/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T13:49:08Z

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Google announced earnings that were better than expected, however, the company warned of headwinds ... More because of tariffs. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Updated, April 25, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the spelling of Procter & Gamble. Key Takeaways Stocks staged a broad rally on Thursday, led by tech stocks. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.75%. That was followed by both the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, both gaining 2%. Meantime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a gain of 1.2%. Ten of the 11 S&P sectors closed higher with Consumer Staples being the only sector to close lower. As we get further into earnings season, we’re seeing a continuation of something that began with United Airlines. Companies are struggling when it comes to forecasting in this environment. Alphabet, who beat on their earnings report, said tariffs will be a headwind. American Airlines, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and others have all specifically called out the unique nature of the current geopolitical situation and economic policies being implemented. We’re also seeing massive shifts in supply chains. Apple recently announced it hopes to move most iPhone production to India by 2026. I expect these types of announcements and changes will continue as we get earnings reports from more household-type names. Right now, the only trend to this market is that there is no trend. Technicians and fundamentalists are all struggling to make heads or tails of what is happening. That makes for a challenging situation. Therefore, I think it's important to take a step back here and discuss the broader trading and investing environment as well as how it might make sense to approach the market. We are seeing a heightened level of volatility sustain itself. Even if you are not someone who trades options, this is important because higher volatility means the expected trading ranges for stocks will be wider. It was just a few months ago when the expected move in the S&P 500 was +/- 50 points for a week. Friday alone the expected move in the S&P 500 is over 60 points and looking to next week, the expected move is over 170 points. Those large, expected moves in the index trickle down to individual stocks as well. Apple has an expected move Friday of $4 whereas a couple months ago, expected moves of the day were half that. Large moves have practical implications for both investors and traders. If you are someone who invests in stocks and does dollar cost averaging, you’ll want to take the wider trading ranges into consideration. If you were buying more stock anytime price fell 1%, you may now want to wait for 1.5% to 2%. You should also expect a greater volatility in your account value when market volatility is higher. At the moment, with the VIX around 27, the market's daily expected moves are around 1.5x historical averages. If you have a portfolio that is closely correlated to the market, expect your daily swings to be larger. If you are an options trader, a higher volatility market is what you want. Option premium is what we call, “rich.” What that means is, if you could normally collect $5 selling something like a put that expires in a month, you can now collect $7.50 to $10. Greater volatility means people are willing to pay more for options, this of course makes sense with puts to many people, as you see the downside protection. But those short calls, be it in a covered call or spread, may not go down as much as expected. Again, higher volatility, means that a wider range of stock movement (both up and down) is expected, so all options hold more premium. One of the most important things when volatility is like this is keeping position size small and defining your risk before you place a trade. These types of markets will bring out a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacks, meaning it'll be easy to say what you should have done. Before you go beating yourself up with what you should have sold or should have bought, remind yourself that there is an emotional aspect of trading. I've been doing this my entire adult life and I still succumb to the emotional aspects at times. Therefore, understanding your risk tolerance ahead of time is crucial, it helps take as much emotion as possible out of the trade as you have already walked through mentally, what can go wrong. For today, I'm keeping an eye on volatility. Some of the more esoteric measures of volatility actually have come down over the past few days, and ideally, we'll see that carry over into the VIX. However, next week is a big week for economic data and earnings. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report and employment for April are just two of the many economic reports due. Then companies like Apple and Meta Platforms, among a number of other companies, are scheduled to announce earnings. Therefore, I'm not so sure we'll see that VIX contraction just yet. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Title: Spatchcock a chicken for an easy — and inexpensive — meal for 4
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/25/spatchcock-chicken-recipe/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T13:20:26Z
Full Content:
By Gretchen McKay, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette With decades of cooking and testing recipes under my apron, I’m no spring chicken. (Sadly.) But I certainly love to eat a good spring chicken, especially if preparing the meal for my family entails an easy recipe that’s built on inexpensive, everyday pantry ingredients and fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables. This simple, budget-minded dinner for four is perfect for the first sunny days of spring. Nothing is more comforting than the aroma of a roasting chicken, but when you’re busy with work or kids or just would rather spend those two or three hours outdoors, you might consider that a stuck-indoors, winter activity. Yet if you follow my lead and spatchcock (butterfly) a whole bird — removing the backbone and then cracking it with the heel of your hands to flatten it — you will not only cut precious cooking time in half, but the breasts and thighs will also cook more evenly. As for the sides, shine a light on carrots and a salad of tender butterhead lettuce tossed with crunchy radish and cucumber. To keep costs down, I shopped at several stores rather than filling my shopping cart at the most convenient (and often more expensive) grocery. For instance, when a whole roaster chicken found where I do most of my everyday shopping looked like it was going to eat up too much of my $25 budget, I talked myself into using chicken thighs instead. Then, I happened to dash into Aldi to pick up a last-minute bag of lemons ($2.89) after a little shoe shopping and, voila! I found a plump, 4-pound roaster in the meat section for just $8.59 and I was back to my original plan. While the carrots I sliced and roasted as a side dish were downright cheap at 99 cents per pound, the $3 I paid for a nice-sized head of fresh Boston lettuce was a bit of a surprise. At least the radishes and cucumber were cheap. Eggs are still kind of pricey, even at today’s “bargain” price of around $5 a dozen. But the crumbly, shortbread-like French butter cookies I made for dessert (followed by late-night snacking) only required two, so no big whoop, right? Not to sound like a broken record, but this probably bears repeating in these tough economic times: Smart shoppers peruse their refrigerators and pantries before they go grocery shopping, both to get some fresh ideas for dinner (what leftovers aren’t people eating?) and to make sure they don’t buy something they already have or need to use up ASAP.

Title: Spatchcock a chicken for an easy — and inexpensive — meal for 4

By Gretchen McKay, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette With decades of cooking and testing recipes under my apron, I’m no spring chicken. (Sadly.) But I certainly love to eat a good spring chicken, especially if preparing the meal for my family entails an easy recipe that’s built on inexpensive, everyday pantry ingredients and fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables. This simple, budget-minded dinner for four is perfect for the first sunny days of spring. Nothing is more comforting than the aroma of a roasting chicken, but when you’re busy with work or kids or just would rather spend those two or three hours outdoors, you might consider that a stuck-indoors, winter activity. Yet if you follow my lead and spatchcock (butterfly) a whole bird — removing the backbone and then cracking it with the heel of your hands to flatten it — you will not only cut precious cooking time in half, but the breasts and thighs will also cook more evenly. As for the sides, shine a light on carrots and a salad of tender butterhead lettuce tossed with crunchy radish and cucumber. To keep costs down, I shopped at several stores rather than filling my shopping cart at the most convenient (and often more expensive) grocery. For instance, when a whole roaster chicken found where I do most of my everyday shopping looked like it was going to eat up too much of my $25 budget, I talked myself into using chicken thighs instead. Then, I happened to dash into Aldi to pick up a last-minute bag of lemons ($2.89) after a little shoe shopping and, voila! I found a plump, 4-pound roaster in the meat section for just $8.59 and I was back to my original plan. While the carrots I sliced and roasted as a side dish were downright cheap at 99 cents per pound, the $3 I paid for a nice-sized head of fresh Boston lettuce was a bit of a surprise. At least the radishes and cucumber were cheap. Eggs are still kind of pricey, even at today’s “bargain” price of around $5 a dozen. But the crumbly, shortbread-like French butter cookies I made for dessert (followed by late-night snacking) only required two, so no big whoop, right? Not to sound like a broken record, but this probably bears repeating in these tough economic times: Smart shoppers peruse their refrigerators and pantries before they go grocery shopping, both to get some fresh ideas for dinner (what leftovers aren’t people eating?) and to make sure they don’t buy something they already have or need to use up ASAP. They also make sure their stomachs are full so there’s no impulse buying or taking shortcuts with already-prepared foods, which tend to be more expensive than scratch dishes. Ingredients I was able to leave off my shopping list (but wouldn’t have added a lot to the final tally) include the olive oil and mustard used in the vinaigrette and marinade, a cup and a half of rice to serve with the chicken, and some of the spices and herbs used for flavoring and aromatics.

Title: AI Valley: Microsoft, Google, and the trillion-dollar race to cash in on Artificial Intelligence

Kasparov contemplated that if he was playing a human, he would have thought of a few anticipatory moves and used his speed to create tension forcing his opponent to make mistakes. But the emotionless machine had rapidly calculated many moves ahead and played with such tenacity that it unnerved him enough to surrender the game. Kasparov’s defeat marked a major milestone in machine intelligence. I remember the sci-fi fantasy movie Her (2013), in which a lonely man falls in love with his operating system. It becomes his constant companion, sensing his needs and moods and conversing like a human through the day. That science fiction is now real. Launched in early 2023, the AI application, Pi, enables users to create their own personal assistants with the mission to make them happier, healthier, and more productive. This obsession of programmers to teach machines to replicate human behaviour has led to an unprecedented revolution in technology. Pulitzer Prize winning author, Gary Rivlin’s new book AI Valley chronicles the evolution of computing from the early days of the invention of silicon chips, the earliest programming software to the remarkable race being played out right now to win the artificial intelligence battle with trillions of dollars at stake. In the form of a page turning thriller, Rivlin’s book details how AI has rapidly permeated everyone’s lives. The iPhone arranges the photographs you click into albums on its own, word processors correct your grammar, write letters for you, programmes do homework, answer your phone, and pay your bills. Generative AI apps like ChatGPT can now make your still photos dance and even convert screenplays into high quality films. If you had to only read one book about the rapid advances of technology, this is it. Rivlin has covered the history of nearly every player in the race to the top of the game including the VCs who funded and the companies they funded. Companies tumble out of the book at the pace of nearly a company a page, covering Microsoft, Intel, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Google, and hundreds of start-ups including newer AI ones like DeepMind, OpenAI and Nvidia. The biggest hero of this book is easily Satya Nadella. Microsoft, the earliest mover in the computing space was left out when FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) became the new darlings at the stock market. After two decades of no growth, missing the search, mobile computing and social tech revolutions, Nadella rapidly shifted the focus of the organisation to cloud computing and AI when he took over as CEO. With investments in the two largest AI companies OpenAI and Inflection AI, Microsoft swiftly multiplied revenues and within a few years, at $3 trillion in market capitalisation, is back as the hot stock ahead of Google ($1.8 trillion), Amazon ($1.6 trillion), Facebook ($1 trillion) and Netflix ($0.5 trillion). Rivlin uses multiple data points to show how Generative AI is not like a conventional start-up investment due to the large-scale funding needed in mining huge amounts of data, high speed processing computing power and expensive tech talent that just doesn’t get excited with only stock. Even with such high entry barriers, GenAI has managed to raise seed funding of billions of dollars. If this book was a film, it would be the story of Reid Hoffman, a former product manager at Apple, called the Midas VC in Silicon Valley, for his extraordinary ability to seed-fund some of the biggest tech companies of our times and of Suleyman, his protégé, the Syrian whizkid who formed two of the biggest AI companies, DeepMind, and Inflection AI. While Hoffman is the founder of LinkedIn, he’s more famous for his investments in companies like PayPal, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Flikr, Groupon, Convoy, and OpenAI and has used his extensive networking skills to build these companies to great scale. Rivlin says that Hoffman used to brief the Pope at the Vatican annually on how AI will change the world in education, medicine, agriculture and living. DeepMind, for instance, made the most meaningful AI breakthrough in 2022 when it discovered AlphaFold which gave humans an understanding of protein structures that would help new drug discoveries and therapies in pursuit of immortality. The book balances the narrative with the pitfalls and challenges of too much AI, of computers suffering hallucinations, or spewing irrelevant answers occasionally. AI machines need to be continually trained by humans to respect racist, sexist, and religious sentiments as Rivlin warns of the dangers of unregulated AI, with its abilities to create a pandemic or even empty out a bank. AI is not a love affair, it’s a rage, says Rivlin, as he talks of how every VC is hunting for an AI idea to fund and how the companies they fund scramble for supremacy. US politicians have always tried to rein in big-tech and just like the speed of adoption of technology, the call from Congress to testify comes faster too. In 1999, after nearly two decades selling software, Bill Gates was summoned to explain his predatory practice of bunding his software for competitive dominance and threatened to break his company. In under a decade, Facebook was called in on data privacy, but Sam Altman of OpenAI was called in barely within his first year to explain how machines will be stopped from doing evil. When it comes to technology, time and again, it’s been proven how the current leaders of tech are humbled by the new. For instance, the early chatbots Siri and Alexa did not try to improvise like ChatGPT whose strikingly human qualities like the ability to tell a joke, admit mistakes, and ask follow-up questions fetched it 900 million downloads in nine weeks. ChatGPT also leapfrogged Google search and provided direct answers instead of 10 blue ticks for linked articles. The chapter titled ‘Kevin Roose, I love You’ recounts the hilarious incident of how the writer was seeking ideas for Valentine’s Day from the chatbot Sydney when it suggested that it loves him and that he should leave his wife! Time magazine ran the entire transcript where the chatbot told Roose, ‘You make me feel things I never felt before, you make me happy, you make me feel alive!’ It demonstrated the ability of machines to learn how to influence humans and persuade them to act in destructive and harmful ways. The oldest fear about automation has always been that it’ll take away human jobs. The irony then is that the first guy who lost his job due to artificial intelligence was Sam Altman, the young founder of OpenAI, the first AI company, who was sacked by his board for announcing AI to the market before they knew about it. Rivlin chronicles every move and counter move in the drama of his sacking and of his glorious comeback. As you ruminate after reading the book, you realise that every path-breaking technological development since Kasparov’s defeat, be it software, apps, cloud computing and storage, data, voice, and image capture is driving humanity towards its own replacement. In the poignant ending of the movie Her, the man sadly realises that his AI assistant who he is in love with is not exclusive to him but is in love with thousands of humans at the same time. And in the final moment of heartbreak, the AI chatbot is upgraded and vanishes from his computer. His ex-wife comes over to share his grief as they sit on the roof of his apartment building and watch the sunrise over the city. Now that is something AI can’t do!

But Atlanta-based startup Pindrop just hit a new milestone helping fight the increase in fraud that the technology has brought. After more than 10 years in business, the firm surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and such growth is driven by its efforts to fight deepfakes—digitally created hoax recordings, images or videos. CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan said the company has seen a 111% increase in deepfake-related fraud attempts since 2022. The company even had a moment in the spotlight last year: It identified a fraudulent robocall impersonating former President Joe Biden’s voice that was used in New Hampshire to discourage Democrats from voting. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes; Photos by Getty Images: LAW Ho Ming; Michael A. McCoy/Stringer Tesla’s stock surged despite the company posting some of its worst quarterly results in years this week, as Elon Musk said he would step back from his DOGE duties. But even if Musk becomes a more active CEO again, the problems the EV maker faces—like declining profit margins, intensifying competition and a tarnished brand image—aren’t going away anytime soon. Worse, it’s becoming clear Musk has run out of ideas for how to fix them, writes Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. Just one hour after Forbes released an investigation into metaverse company Infinite Reality, which had previously announced a massive $3 billion fundraise from a single anonymous investor, the company revealed the investor’s identity. The company said the investment was “represented by” Sterling Select, a venture firm affiliated with Sterling Equities, whose cofounders are former principal owners of the New York Mets and prominent figures in the New York real estate industry—and known for their ties to Bernie Madoff. Sterling Equities’ general counsel denied any involvement with the funding round. NurPhoto via Getty Images The Chinese government may exempt some goods from its 125% tariff rate on all U.S. imports over reported concerns about the economic impact of the steep levies—imposed in response to Washington’s “reciprocal” tariffs. It would follow a similar carve out made by the Trump Administration earlier this month for certain items like Chinese-made smartphones and laptops. In a sign of the shifting cultural tides, 39% of companies said they would scale back on engagement for LGBTQ Pride Month this June, a survey from Gravity Research found. The executives surveyed from top companies cited conservative activists and President Donald Trump, who has waged a war on DEI and targeted the transgender community. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google parent company Alphabet topped earnings expectations as it was the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology giants to report results from an uncertain first quarter. Google stock jumped about 4% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are expected to report their earnings next week. The White House is reportedly considering a number of proposals to incentivize Americans to have children amid declining birth rates in the U.S., including a potential $5,000 “baby bonus.” When asked about the proposal, President Donald Trump called the bonus a “good idea,” though it would need to be approved by Congress. After President Donald Trump suggested it on Truth Social, the Trump Organization fired its ethics attorney, whom Harvard University hired to help with its lawsuit against the federal government. The Trump Organization began working with attorney William Burck in January to help prevent conflicts of interest between the company and Trump’s presidency, but the move to fire him raises questions about Trump’s independence from his business empire. ILLUSTRATION BY FORBES; IMAGES BY GOOGLE GEMINI AI Talk to any financial advisor these days, and he or she is likely to have a strong opinion about something known as “structured notes.” These complex products are sold as the “have your cake and eat it” investments of the wealth management world. Their specialty is flexibility—some are geared toward growth and others toward income. Returns are capped and in all cases the goal is to limit downside risk. They are manufactured by big banks like JPMorgan using derivatives, and are often sold as “stock market-linked” with “sleep well at night” protection. They come with maturities ranging from six months to five years, provide principal protection and sometimes offer annual yields of 10% or more. Up until the last few years, structured notes were mostly the domain of hedge funds and other sophisticated investors or ultra-wealthy clients. But thanks to clever engineering, the notes are now being offered by scores of brokers and sold in bite-sized $1,000 increments. The current market volatility and uncertainty has caused them to surge in popularity. Last year the broker-sold U.S. structured notes market reached a record high of nearly $150 billion, up 46% from the previous year, according to London’s Deriva Intelligence. JPMorgan was the top issuer in 2024, followed closely by the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays. WHY IT MATTERS "The surge in downside protection securities signals a proactive approach by both advisors and investors in response to today's market uncertainty,” says Forbes staff writer Sergei Klebnikov. “As these complex products which seek to limit losses become increasingly accessible, it's imperative that investors understand the nuances of different costs and risks involved."

More of their meeting at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on April 21, 2025. (Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 40% or more in the upcoming months? Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that’s like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don’t be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over. This contrarian view isn’t just gut instinct - it’s part of the macro-conscious, fundamentals-first philosophy that drives our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. That same philosophy also guides our thinking beyond individual stocks. If you believe markets are rational and always priced right, consider this: the U.S. may be running a demand deficit far more dangerous than its trade deficit. Read: The Real U.S Trade Deficit Armageddon Let’s be real - Nvidia has a boom-bust pattern that’s hard to ignore. Every time the hype gets too hot - whether it’s crypto, gaming, or AI - Nvidia’s stock overshoots and pays for it later. What makes you think it will be different this time? Nvidia is a classic example of how you have to bear extreme volatility while chasing returns. We combine different categories of stocks to lower the volatility while maintaining exposure to the upside in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 25:The Microsoft Copilot app is displayed on a smartphone on April 25, 2025 ... More in Berlin, Germany. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock has declined approximately 7% this year, primarily due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts. However, this concern appears largely overblown as Microsoft’s business model centers around Azure cloud services and software rather than hardware, making it substantially less vulnerable to tariff-related disruptions than hardware-focused tech companies. Separately, for another strong tech name, see Should You Buy GOOG Stock After A Q1 Beat? Looking beyond short-term fluctuations reveals an impressive trajectory: Microsoft's stock has gained approximately 65% since early 2023, driven by: Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% revenue increase, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $262 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Despite a slight margin contraction (from 36.7% to 35.4%) due to increased AI and R&D investments, Microsoft maintains an exceptionally healthy 35% net margin. The company's EPS has increased 29% from $9.65 in 2022 to $12.41 in the trailing twelve months. Microsoft has demonstrated remarkable resilience during market downturns: Microsoft has positioned itself as essential infrastructure for the AI revolution. Similar to how Nvidia provides the GPU processing power, Microsoft delivers the computing resources, data storage, and networking capabilities that underpin AI development across numerous companies, including OpenAI. This allows investors exposure to the broader AI growth story without needing to predict which specific AI application will ultimately dominate. Microsoft represents a compelling investment opportunity despite near-term volatility. Its cloud-first business model shields it from significant tariff impacts, while its position as fundamental infrastructure for the AI revolution provides substantial long-term growth potential with less risk than pure-play AI companies. Currently trading around $390, Microsoft's stock has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31x. Although this is higher than the 24x P/E ratio observed in 2022, it is still below the stock's four-year average P/E of 35x, suggesting potential for further appreciation. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception.

(Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It offers better returns than your bank savings, ignores market crashes, and is tailored for the new economic landscape. Who are we referring to? It’s TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Still overlooking it? We understand. It’s not an exciting tech name or a new AI superstar. It may seem dull. However, this is precisely the tactical error you should sidestep if you aim to grow your wealth. Evading significant fluctuations is crucial for wealth accumulation. The High-Quality portfolio, which aims to minimize volatility while providing compounding upside, has surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Let’s see if you still consider TDG stock unexciting after what we’ll share. You’ve heard enough about tech stocks that fluctuate like trapeze artists. But what if there exists a stock that offers tech-like returns without the chaotic movements? One that provides you with a 5.5% dividend– right now – and possesses the strength to increase that payout continuously? Introducing the defense stock that quietly exceeds expectations – TDG At 5.5%, this dividend outperforms most savings accounts, money markets, and even Treasuries. But here’s the catch – this dividend isn’t a “set-it-and-forget-it” yield. It has momentum behind it. What does this signify? This isn’t merely a dividend investment – it’s a cash-generating machine with growth potential. With healthy margins and swift revenue growth, dividends are set to increase as well. This implies that yields could rise or stay consistent as the stock price appreciates. Either way – you benefit! You enjoy growing income year after year. Many income stocks offer substantial dividends. Few provide them in conjunction with stability and capital appreciation. Contrast that with your favorite tech stocks. Nvidia: -62% in 2022, Meta: -75% drop from peak to trough, and Tesla – well, let’s not even discuss that. With this defense investment, you’re compounding quietly and steadily. And guess what – with its impressive margins, robust cash flow, and a DE ratio of 30%, this stock has considerable capacity to manage increased interest costs as debts are refinanced at higher yields in the coming years. This indicates that the risk to dividend growth is minimal. Think defense stocks are dull? Think again. Tariffs have returned. U.S.-China tensions are rising. The new industrial policy wave (whether called re-shoring, de-risking, or “Make America Build Again”) represents a favorable environment for defense expenses. Defense firms are not only safeguarded – they are positioned to prosper. And TDG has remained steadfast during market crises in the past. However, as the saying goes – never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is crafted to diversify stock-specific risks while providing access to potential growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Eira is an editor for Mind the Product. She's been a business journalist, editor, and copywriter for longer than she cares to think about. The Washington Post gets cosy with OpenAI, Anthropic underlines its commitment to safety and Intel proposes more layoffs and restructuring, here are the news stories that caught our attention this week. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has partnered with OpenAI to integrate the newspaper's journalism into ChatGPT. ChatGPT now provides users with summaries, quotes, and direct links to original articles from The Washington Post. The newspaper said it continues to be LLM-agnostic and build its own range of AI-powered solutions for both its business and its users. UK AI video generation startup Synthesia is set to launch a new AI agent tool designed to make videos more interactive, according to Sifted. The AI agent will be released in “the first half of this year” and is aimed at improving user engagement by allowing viewers to interact with video content, potentially transforming passive viewing into an active experience. Synthesia also reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April and received a strategic investment from Adobe Ventures. This follows a $180 million funding round in January. Chip maker Intel plans to lay off over 20% of its workforce in a bid to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. As Intel reported its Q1 earnings CEO Lip Bu-Tan also sent a message to employees that lays out plans for restructuring and expands the company’s return to office mandate from three days to four. The layoffs are thought to affect about 22,000 staff, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 at the end of 2024. In a bid to assure us of its commitment to transparency and a proactive culture of safety, Anthropic has published a report showing how its Claude AI model has been exploited by malicious actors and which details the company’s efforts to mitigate this misuse. The report, called Detecting and Countering Malicious Uses of Claude: March 2025, reports that, for instance: According to Anthropic: “This report outlines several case studies on how actors have misused our models, as well as the steps we have taken to detect and counter such misuse.” The report said that users are starting to use AI frontier models to semi-autonomously orchestrate complex abuse systems that involve many social media bots. The company expects this trend to continue as agentic AI systems improve. It also points out that generative AI can accelerate capability development for less sophisticated actors, potentially allowing them to operate at a level previously only achievable by more technically proficient individuals. Anthropic has been largely commended for its transparency in publishing this report. On LinkedIn for example, commentators praised the company for its commitment to safety.

Time Published: 2025-04-25T10:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Rocket Lab’s three planned barge landing tests faced significant delays. A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.
