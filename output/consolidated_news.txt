We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures popped on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off, as investors waited for crucial consumer inflation data that could reset interest-rate bets. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) climbed roughly 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) pushed 0.4% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) also added 0.2%, on the heels of a mixed day on Wall Street. Stocks took a leg higher in pre-market as Wall Street banks posted surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record annual profit and a 50% jump in fourth quarter net income. Its full-year profit of $58 billion was the highest ever in American banking. Its stock rose 1% before the bell. BlackRock (BLK) stock popped after quarterly profit jumped over 20% as assets hit a record $11.6 trillion. Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) shares also gained after the banks booked bumper quarters. Markets are now bracing for Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for December, seen as potential pivot point for stocks after wholesale inflation for the month came in cool. It will be a crucial test of whether an inflation resurgence is a risk to the US economy as investors debate the Federal Reserve's moves on interest rates in 2025.

The CPI report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show annual headline inflation at 2.9% and a monthly rate of 0.4%, up from November's levels. A strong reading could restart the selling in stocks and bonds that has marked the start of 2025.

Title: The Right-Wing Judge on a Mission to Destroy ESG Retirement Planning
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/190212/reed-oconnor-esg-investment-blackrock
Time Published: 2025-01-15T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
There are more than 800 federal judges in the United States. None of them create as much work for their colleagues as Reed O’Connor, a federal judge who serves in the northern district of Texas. For nearly two decades, O’Connor has delivered one ideologically driven ruling after another. No matter how many times those decisions are overturned by the appellate courts and the Supreme Court itself, he persists. In his latest haphazard ruling, O’Connor held last week that American Airlines violated its legal obligations to employees by allowing BlackRock, the company’s 401(k) manager, to consider “environmental, societal, and governance” factors when making investment decisions and casting proxy votes. If upheld on appeal, the ruling threatens to upend the entire retirement plan industry by opening 401(k) managers to litigation and penalties for using ESG factors as part of their investment strategies—something that nearly every manager has done in recent years. At issue in the case is whether the airline violated its legal obligations to employees by investing their 401(k) plans with BlackRock, one of the nation’s three largest investment managers, while the investment firm pursued environmentally and socially conscious goals. The class-action plaintiffs claimed that the airline financially harmed its 401(k) participants by not sufficiently scrutinizing BlackRock’s ESG principles when investing and casting proxy votes in shareholder meetings. BlackRock currently manages more than $10 trillion in retirement funds. Like nearly all such managers, it adopted a series of ESG policies over the last decade. Those policies led it to use its proxy voting powers on behalf of shareholders to encourage companies to adopt more socially and environmentally conscious policies. In perhaps the most famous episode, it sided with a group of activist investors in a 2021 proxy vote to put three members on ExxonMobil’s board who would push for investments in renewable energy. The plaintiffs claimed that this approach violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known as ERISA. The law sets basic standards for pensions and employee benefit and retirement plans offered by employers. Those employers have a fiduciary requirement to administer their plans on behalf of their employees to minimize risk, avoid conflicts of interest, and so on. Two of these obligations are known as the “duty of prudence” and the “duty of loyalty.” In the plaintiff’s telling, considering ESG issues when making investment decisions violates these duties because they inherently reduce the fund’s performance. “[American Airlines and its subsidiaries] have violated ERISA by selecting and retaining ESG funds that pursue nonfinancial or nonpecuniary objectives like ESG social policy objectives, rather than investment funds that have the exclusive purpose of maximizing financial returns for investors,” they argued in their complaint. American Airlines rejected that assertion and noted that it followed industry standards when offering investment products to employees via BlackRock and reviewing the managers’ actions, which it deemed to be prudent. It also denied that it acted disloyally to its employees by using BlackRock, even though it (and most other investment managers) is a shareholder in American Airlines itself, based on existing precedent. The airline further warned that adopting the plaintiffs’ approach could itself be illegal. “Acceptance of Plaintiff’s theory would compel ERISA fiduciaries to ignore actual investment performance and instead screen out investment options ‘based on non-pecuniary factors’ (i.e., the manager’s proxy voting record when the rationale for such votes is speculative at best), potentially harming participants by depriving them of access to some of the best performing, most popular, and highest rated funds in the market,” the company wrote. “Ironically, this is the exact practice that Plaintiff insists is forbidden by ERISA.” O’Connor ultimately accepted the plaintiffs’ assumption that ESG principles inherently reduced shareholder returns and sided with them. But he struggled to separate out ESG investing, which he found to be unlawful, with investment managers such as BlackRock considering environmental and social factors when deciding how to invest funds, which he found to be acceptable. “If the reason for investing in the company is because these social expenditures are viewed as reasonably reducing, for example, the material risk of government expropriation of the oil fields or mitigating against other types of impactful labor strife, this is not ESG investing because the focus is fundamentally fixed on maximizing a financial benefit,” O’Connor wrote as part of a hypothetical scenario. “But if the reason is due to the belief that the company has a responsibility to improve the society in which it operates notwithstanding the lack of or reduced economic benefit to the company,” the judge continued, “such a non-pecuniary consideration would qualify investments based on these social expenditures as a form of ESG investing.” Even accepting some of O’Connor’s assumptions, his reasoning would require litigants and judges to engage in some casual telepathy to determine a fund manager’s motives. Suppose, for example, BlackRock said that it would draw down its investments in oil and gas companies because of the risk that future climate-minded regulations would impact profits. Is that an unreasonable assumption? Or could it be attacked as a pretext to adopt ESG principles by other means? O’Connor complicated matters by only giving the plaintiffs half of what they wanted. While he ruled that American Airlines had violated its duty of loyalty by not spurning or challenging BlackRock for its ESG initiatives, he rejected the plaintiffs’ assertion that the company had violated the duty of prudence along the way. O’Connor complained that the airline had not acted imprudently when supervising employees’ retirement plans, namely by “selecting and retaining investment managers, overseeing proxy voting, and not intervening in the Exxon proxy vote.” He held that the plaintiffs had offered no evidence that the airline had gone against the industry’s best practices by continuing to rely on BlackRock, noting that no one else had removed the firm after the ExxonMobil vote, either. And while the plaintiffs pointed to the Texas legislature’s recent divestiture from BlackRock over its ESG policies, O’Connor admitted that the lawmakers’ moves, while “based on their sound view of the public interest,” weren’t bound by ERISA’s requirement to follow prevailing industry standards. The split ruling leads to a paradoxical result: In its telling, American Airlines violated ERISA by not challenging BlackRock’s ESG efforts in general and the ExxonMobil vote in particular, but would have also violated ERISA if it had imprudently dropped the management firm after the ExxonMobil vote. O’Connor tried to square the circle by describing the retirement plan industry as “oligopolist” and “cartel-like,” and claiming that “industry norms are not enough to safeguard against breaches of loyalty,” but the paradox remained. This mishmash of a ruling is par for the course with O’Connor. The judge became famous in the 2010s for habitually ruling that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. In 2018, he ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional because a Republican-led Congress had zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty. The decision was widely condemned as lawless, even by some of the ACA’s critics. In 2021, the Supreme Court nixed the lawsuit on standing grounds in a 7–2 ruling, with even Justice Clarence Thomas voting to uphold the ACA. More recently, O’Connor butchered the Indian Child Welfare Act through a series of profound misreadings of Indian law and precedent, again leading to a 7–2 reversal by the justices. O’Connor is also widely seen as an extremely friendly judge to conservative legal interests. Right-wing plaintiffs routinely file lawsuits in his division in hopes of getting them assigned to him. Elon Musk, the far-right CEO of X, updated the company’s terms of service last fall to require that any user lawsuit brought against X be filed in O’Connor’s division in Texas, even though the company is headquartered in California. It is unsurprising that the plaintiffs chose his court to file an anti-ESG lawsuit in, or that he might be interested in enforcing right-wing policy goals. Last December, for example, O’Connor threw out a proposed plea deal between the Justice Department and Boeing over its 737 MAX crashes because of a provision that would have required a federal monitor to be selected “in keeping with the [Justice] Department’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.” The judge claimed that “the parties’ DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the government and Boeing’s ethics and anti-fraud efforts.” The Supreme Court is already hearing two cases this term derived from O’Connor’s trial-court rulings. In one of them, Garland v. VanDerStok, the justices appeared poised to uphold a ghost-gun regulation that the judge had previously struck down. And the court agreed last week to review the lower court rulings in Becerra v. Braidwood Management Inc. In that case, O’Connor struck down an ACA mandate that required companies to provide coverage for preventative-care services, siding with a group of Texas employers who wanted to deny coverage for anti-HIV medications for their workers on religious grounds. If neither the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals nor the high court reverses O’Connor in the American Airlines case, it could potentially reshape how the 401(k) management industry considers risks when making investments in general, as well as severely damage ESG efforts in particular. More litigation will follow, as well as potential financial hits to major American companies themselves—O’Connor has yet to rule on the penalty for American Airlines in this case. It is usually hard to predict whether the Supreme Court will take up a particular case at this stage in the proceedings. With O’Connor, however, we can assume that the court’s intervention is more likely than not. Matt Ford is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Title: Morgan Stanley: “[TSMC’s] Customers Like AMD And Broadcom Are Releasing CoWoS-S Capacity Due To Weaker Demand,” Allowing NVIDIA To “Convert This Capacity To CoWoS-L For GB300A Production”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few days, the proverbial waters have become quite murky due to the lack of visibility over TSMC's supposed travails related to its bespoke wafer-level system integration platform, CoWoS. Now, however, analysts at Morgan Stanley have stepped up to offer some much-needed clarity on this topic and its implications, if any, on NVIDIA's product roll out. As per a recent report by The Information, NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers purportedly continue to face overheating and glitching issues, apparently prompting the chipmaker's mega customers, including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, to pare their respective Blackwell orders. The report went on to note that Blackwell's woes stem from the "way [those] chips connect," alluding to a possible flaw within TSMC's bespoke advanced packaging solution, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), which enables the integration of multiple chips into a single package. This report struck a nerve with investors, especially as NVIDIA had declared back in 2024 that it was able to rectify Blackwell's performance-related teething issues by implementing minor changes to the photomask, a specific template that is used to create patterns on chip wafers. However, soon after, DigiTimes calmed perturbed investors by leveraging its internal sources within TSMC to report that, contrary to The Information's report, TSMC has "maintained" its existing Blackwell orders, negating the rumored decrease in orders from NVIDIA's mega customers. Morgan Stanley’s view on TSMC’s CoWoS order fluctuations highlights that some customers, like $AMD and Broadcom, are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand. $NVDA, however, has stepped in and requested $TSM to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production.… https://t.co/jneCfh0goi — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 15, 2025 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh note, shedding some much-needed additional light on this topic. According to the Wall Street titan, some TSMC customers, including AMD and Broadcom, "are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand." This aligns with a separate note penned by Nomura, which notes that NVIDIA "could slash CoWoS-S orders from TSMC and UMC by up to 80% in 2025 due to weaker demand for Hopper platform chips." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's Hopper chips utilize TSMC's CoWoS-S tech while the newer Blackwell chips leverage the global chip fabrication giant's CoWoS-L packaging tech. Coming back, Morgan Stanley then goes on to note that, in light of CoWoS-S capacity cancelations, NVIDIA "has stepped in and requested TSMC to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production." Morgan Stanley also declares: "Despite these shifts, TSMC’s overall CoWoS demand remains steady, with a slight potential increase in GB300A production later this year." This means that The Information's report might have been partially correct: there have been order cancelations at TSMC. However, as clarified by Morgan Stanley, the cancelations only affect orders that leverage TSMC’s CoWoS-S packaging technology and that NVIDIA's Blackwell orders likely remain unaffected.

Title: US stock futures drift higher ahead of CPI release, bank earnings on tap

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed sharply higher Wednesday as cooling inflation and strong quarterly earnings from Wall Street banks stoked bullish sentiment on stocks. At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 703 points, or 1.7%, the S&P 500 index added 1.8%, and the NASDAQ Composite climbed 2.5%. Sentiment has been boosted Wednesday after data showed the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI gained 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. However, the surprise came with the so-called “core” figure, which strips out volatile components like fuel and food. This rose 0.2% on a monthly basis and 3.2% year-on-year, below expectations for 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively. Still, some on Wall Street continue to see risks for inflation and reiterate expectations for just one cut this year. "Our baseline remains for just one further 25 bps cut from the FOMC, with the most likely timing being March or May. Risks remain skewed to a later date," Macquarie said in a note. Heading into the report, concerns had been swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. Markets are positioning for a much slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2025, with the Federal Reserve forecasting just two rate cuts - a trend that could bode poorly for risk-driven assets. There had been fears before this release that the Fed may actually be forced by sticky inflation to raise rates this year. In the corporate sector, a number of major banks impressed with their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, offering a boost to the waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2% after the investment banking giant posted record annual profit as its dealmakers and traders reaped a windfall from rebounding markets in the fourth quarter. The Wall Street bank also touted increased share buybacks. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock soared 6% after the investment bank’s profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter, driven by strong reading results. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock gained nearly 7% after the lender reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter, buoyed by stronger investment banking earnings. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, climbed 5% after reporting a beat on both the top and bottom lines as its assets hit a record high in Q4. Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (NASDAQ:BECN) rose more than 7% after the building products distributor said QXO had made an deal worth $11 billion to buy the company. President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday that Israel and Hamas reached ceasefire and hostage deal to end 15 months of war on the Gaza strip. (Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)

Title: Hold onto your current job if you want to keep working remotely
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-hybrid-work-from-home-jobs-persisting-fewer-new-roles-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-15T09:15:02Z

Americans who want to keep their work-from-home arrangements may need to cling to their jobs. Corporate giants like Amazon, AT&T, and JPMorgan have notified employees they must return to the office five days a week this year. This comes as the share of remote and hybrid postings on job platforms has ticked down in recent years — which has made landing one of these roles more difficult. As of November, the share of postings on Indeed for remote and hybrid jobs had declined to 7.8% from over 10% in 2022, according to the platform's data. On LinkedIn, the share of remote or hybrid postings had declined to roughly 21% as of December, down from 26% two years prior. But remote and hybrid jobs haven't faded away. In December, roughly 23% of US workers worked from home at least part of the time, up from about 19% two years prior, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, about 10% worked completely from home. "We keep hearing stories that 'work from home is over,' and while, yes, it is true for some firms, others must be doing the reverse," Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist and cofounder of the remote-work-research website WFH Research, told Business Insider. Bloom's research has found that the share of paid full days worked from home in the US has been fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bloom and other economists told BI that the divide between remote or hybrid job postings and work-from-home rates suggested that some employers could be prioritizing in-person hires while letting some of their existing employees continue working more flexibly. They said this strategy could allow companies to boost their in-office attendance without drawing the ire of employees who've grown used to a remote or hybrid arrangement. "We know that companies frequently make exceptions to return-to-office mandates for employees to avoid losing them, so policy changes might affect new hires more than incumbent employees," Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told BI. This approach would allow workers to retain their flexible work arrangements — but make it more difficult for them to snag a remote or hybrid role at another company, Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn's Economic Graph Research Institute, told BI. "If you already have a job and you are grandfathered into this flexible work, you're maintaining it in a lot of cases," Kantenga said. "Companies are using those new positions to roll that flexible work back a little bit, but they're not necessarily rolling it back for the workers who already have it." Even if more businesses prioritize in-person hiring, it could take awhile for work-from-home rates to fall significantly, Lisa Simon, the chief economist at Revelio Labs, said. That's because hiring, layoffs, and resignations have slowed, which means that "very few people have actually changed jobs in the last two years" and businesses haven't added many new workers who would be subject to recent RTO mandates, Simon told BI. However, the modest share of available remote or hybrid jobs could be somewhat misleading. Simon said that a slowdown in hiring for white-collar roles — where flexible working arrangements are more common — could be pushing down remote and hybrid job postings. Additionally, Bloom said some companies might not want to commit to a flexible working arrangement in the job posting but could ultimately allow the employee to work from home at least some of the time. "They don't want to repeat the 2021 mistake of promising generous work from home only to have to painfully reverse this later," he said. Bloom added that for some roles — like university professors — working from home on days when they don't have classes is a norm of the job. However, a job posting might not classify this position as remote or hybrid. Pollak said remote and hybrid roles are generally underrepresented in job postings because they tend to have lower turnover than the typical in-person job. "A hotel may replace its entire staff of janitors three times a year but only replace its remote customer-support staff every two years," she said.

Title: Futures muted with CPI, bank earnings ahead - what's moving markets

Investing.com - US stock futures are steady ahead of the publication of a crucial US inflation report and the release of quarterly earnings from several banking giants. Economists predict that a gauge of consumer price growth that could play into the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy accelerated slightly in December. Meanwhile, with a post-election stock market surge possibly easing, investors are looking to the results from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other lenders to help reignite the rally. 1. Futures steady US stock futures hovered around the flatline on Wednesday, as investors prepared for the release of key US inflation data and a slew of earnings from major Wall Street lenders. By 03:29 ET (08:29 GMT), the Dow futures contract, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly unchanged. The main averages logged a mixed close following a choppy session on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipping and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 ending higher. A softer-than-expected reading of US producer price growth fueled an initial rise in equities, but the report was not enough to materially impact the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Traders were paying particularly close attention to a jump in airfare prices, which contribute to a crucial measure of inflation favored by Fed rate-setters. 2. CPI ahead Attention now turns to the release of a gauge of consumer prices, which could provide further clarity around the state of inflation. Economists estimate that the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI is seen at 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. Stripping out items like food and fuel, the so-called “core” figure is projected to come in at 0.3% on a monthly basis and 3.3% year-on-year, matching November. Heading into the report, concerns have swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. US government bond yields have touched multi-month highs in recent days, weighing on the attractiveness of stocks, as investors have dialed back bets that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts this year. The central bank slashed borrowing costs by a full percentage point in 2024. While bond investors may have been encouraged by the soft producer prices print, some analysts have flagged that even a CPI number in line with forecasts may not be enough to stem the bearish sentiment. 3. Bank earnings Several major lenders are due to report their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, with investors eyeing them as a potential source of life for a waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup (NYSE:C), as well as asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), are set to announce their numbers prior to the opening bell on Wednesday. Investment banking and trading revenues will likely be a focal point, especially following a surge in stocks after Trump's election victory that was fueled by hopes on Wall Street for a new era of looser regulations and lower taxes. A dip in corporate borrowing costs could buoy top-line results as well. Analysts have also predicted that the Fed's rate cuts may have bolstered net interest margins, or the difference between what a lender pays out for deposits and makes from borrowing. 4. US to push TSMC, Samsung to tighten China chip supplies - Bloomberg The US is planning more regulations aimed at limiting the flow of advanced chips made by TSMC and its peers into China, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, adding to a flurry of restrictions imposed by the Biden administration. The proposed measures will encourage manufacturers such as TSMC (TW:2330), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to more carefully scrutinize their customers for ties to blacklisted Chinese organizations, Bloomberg said. The report comes just days after the US introduced additional restrictions on the export of cutting-edge artificial intelligence chips, in a continued effort to cut China off from advances in the fast-growing technology. 5. Crude gains Oil prices advanced Wednesday, helped by a drop in US crude stockpiles as well as fears that new sanctions on Russian oil exports will disrupt global supplies. By 03:30 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) rose by 0.5% to $76.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.4% to $80.27 per barrel. Prices slipped on Tuesday after the US Energy Information Administration predicted oil would come under pressure over the next two years as supply would outpace demand. That said, the market has found some support from a report from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday that showed a decline in crude stockpiles in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer. Traders also continue to focus on the Russian oil sanctions, amid uncertainty around how much Russian supply will be lost in the global market and whether alternative measures can offset the shortfall.

Title: Washington Post in CRISIS: Resignations, retrenchment and revenue slump

The Washington Post (WaPo) suffered a $100 million revenue loss in 2024, primarily due to a massive decline in digital readership, dropping from 22.5 million daily users to just 2.5 to three million. In response to financial struggles, WaPo laid off approximately 100 employees. The paper also experienced significant staff resignations, including high-profile editors and columnists, following the decision not to endorse Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. The publication's credibility and influence have been severely eroded by internal conflicts over editorial decisions such as not endorsing Harris, which led to a loss of 250,000 paid subscribers. Bezos's decision not to endorse Harris, which he defended in an op-ed, sparked a significant exodus of long-time staffers further damaging the publication's reputation and newsroom. WaPo's struggles highlight the challenges faced by traditional media outlets in a polarized and digital-first media landscape, raising questions about its ability to regain stability.

WaPo's struggles highlight the challenges faced by traditional media outlets in a polarized and digital-first media landscape, raising questions about its ability to regain stability. The Washington Post (WaPo), once a bastion of American journalism, finds itself in a state of unprecedented decline as it grapples with a staggering $100 million revenue loss in 2024 and a near-collapse of its digital readership. WaPo's struggles are emblematic of a publication caught between shifting political tides and internal turmoil. During the peak of the 2024 presidential election, the newspaper's website averaged just 2.5 million to three million daily visitors â a stark contrast to the 22.5 million daily users it boasted at the start of the Biden administration. This 87 percent decline in digital traffic has had a devastating impact on the paper's bottom line, with subscription and ad revenue plummeting by $100 million in 2024 alone. The resulting loss of revenue has forced WaPo to lay off roughly 100 employees this month, marking yet another chapter in its ongoing financial and editorial crisis. The layoffs impacted about four percent of the publication's workforce and primarily targeted business divisions. (Related: Washington Post to lay off nearly 100 employees in latest round of cuts.) A WaPo spokesperson said the publication "is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." They added: "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position the Post for the future." The paper's woes were further compounded when it lost 250,000 paid subscribers in a single blow after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intervened to block an endorsement of outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle. The decision not to endorse Harris, a move that broke with decades of tradition, sparked a wave of resignations and internal dissent. Bezos defended his decision not to endorse the Democrat in an October op-ed, writing that "presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election." Later, the Amazon founder insisted that his refusal to back Harris "was the right decision" he was "proud" to have chosen. WaPo faces credibility crisis with staff resignations While Bezos defended his decision not to endorse Harris, the WaPo newsroom did not take too kindly to it. Many longtime staffers left the paper including Robert Kagan, the paper's editor-at-large. Kagan, the husband of former Department of State official Victoria Nuland, stepped down in October. Several staffers followed suit and handed in their resignation letters. Managing editor Matea Gold and reporters Josh Dawsey, Michael Scherer, Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager jumped ship and joined other mainstream media publications. WaPo was also rocked by two resignations this month. Columnist Jennifer Rubin announced her exit just days before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, lambasting the paper for failing to uphold its journalistic mission. "Bezos and his cronies accommodate and enable the most acute threat to American democracy â Donald Trump â at a time when a vibrant free press is more essential than ever to our democracyâs survival and capacity to thrive," Rubin wrote in her resignation letter. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes also resigned after WaPo refused to publish her satirical cartoon depicting Bezos and other Big Tech figures groveling before Trump. These departures have left the publication's newsroom and editorial sections severely depleted, further eroding its credibility and influence. WaPo's decline is a cautionary tale for legacy media outlets navigating an increasingly polarized and fragmented media landscape. Once a symbol of journalistic excellence, the paper now struggles to retain readers, revenue, and relevance. Its slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness," rings hollow as WaPo itself teeters on the brink of irrelevance. Whether Bezos can steer the publication back to stability or whether it will continue its downward spiral remains an open question. For now, WaPo's future looks as uncertain as the democracy it claims to defend. Watch Harrison Smith of "The American Journal" discussing WaPo owner Jeff Bezos panicking as leftists abandon his publication. Ths video is from the KryptoKing187 channel on Brighteon.com.

Later, the Amazon founder insisted that his refusal to back Harris "was the right decision" he was "proud" to have chosen. WaPo faces credibility crisis with staff resignations While Bezos defended his decision not to endorse Harris, the WaPo newsroom did not take too kindly to it. Many longtime staffers left the paper including Robert Kagan, the paper's editor-at-large. Kagan, the husband of former Department of State official Victoria Nuland, stepped down in October. Several staffers followed suit and handed in their resignation letters. Managing editor Matea Gold and reporters Josh Dawsey, Michael Scherer, Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager jumped ship and joined other mainstream media publications. WaPo was also rocked by two resignations this month. Columnist Jennifer Rubin announced her exit just days before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, lambasting the paper for failing to uphold its journalistic mission. "Bezos and his cronies accommodate and enable the most acute threat to American democracy â Donald Trump â at a time when a vibrant free press is more essential than ever to our democracyâs survival and capacity to thrive," Rubin wrote in her resignation letter. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes also resigned after WaPo refused to publish her satirical cartoon depicting Bezos and other Big Tech figures groveling before Trump. These departures have left the publication's newsroom and editorial sections severely depleted, further eroding its credibility and influence. WaPo's decline is a cautionary tale for legacy media outlets navigating an increasingly polarized and fragmented media landscape. Once a symbol of journalistic excellence, the paper now struggles to retain readers, revenue, and relevance. Its slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness," rings hollow as WaPo itself teeters on the brink of irrelevance. Whether Bezos can steer the publication back to stability or whether it will continue its downward spiral remains an open question. For now, WaPo's future looks as uncertain as the democracy it claims to defend.

Global elites suggest declining populations could accelerate AI and robotics adoption, offering economic advantages by replacing human labor with machines, particularly in developed nations. Critics warn of deepening global inequality, as nations with strong infrastructure and education may thrive in an automated economy, while others risk being left behind. AI and robotics are rapidly replacing both white-collar and blue-collar jobs, with no profession immune, raising alarms about widespread unemployment and societal disruption. Individuals must elevate their roles to stay relevant, as automation reshapes the workforce, with those unable to adapt potentially marginalized in a depopulated future. The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate.

The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate. In a startling revelation that has sparked widespread debate, global elites are openly discussing the potential benefits of depopulation as a catalyst for the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. This controversial perspective, highlighted in a recent Brighteon Broadcast News segment by Mike Adams, suggests that countries with declining populations may have a strategic advantage in transitioning to an automated workforce. However, the ethical and social implications of this shift are raising alarms among critics, who warn of a deepening global divide between nations equipped to embrace automation and those left behind. The conversation was ignited by comments from a BlackRock executive, who argued that shrinking populations in developed countries could accelerate the replacement of human labor with machines. "Countries that have shrinking demographics will rapidly develop robotics and AI technology," the executive stated. "If the promise of these technologies transforms productivity, as most of us believe it will, it could elevate the standard of living even with declining populations." This perspective challenges the traditional view that population decline is inherently negative, instead framing it as an opportunity for economic transformation. The executive further explained that nations with restrictive immigration policies and declining birth rates would find it easier to substitute human workers with machines, avoiding the social complexities of integrating a growing labor force. "The paradigm of negative population growth is going to change," he asserted. "The social problems of replacing humans with machines will be far easier in countries with declining populations." However, this optimistic outlook is not without its critics. Opponents argue that this vision of the future risks exacerbating global inequality. Countries with robust education systems, infrastructure, and rule of law may thrive in an automated economy, while those lacking these foundations could be left further behind. "For countries with rising populations, the answer will be education and rapid development," the executive acknowledged. "But for those without a foundation of rule of law or education, they're going to be left. That's where the divide is going to get more pronounced." The debate underscores a broader ethical dilemma: should humanity prioritize technological advancement over the preservation of human labor? As AI and robotics continue to advance, the potential for job displacement across industries is becoming increasingly apparent. Mike Adams, in his broadcast, emphasized that no profession is immune. "Much of humanity is being replaced by AI systems," he warned. "AI software is replacing white-collar jobs, and AI robots are replacing blue-collar jobs, including in agriculture." Adams recounted conversations with individuals in creative fields, such as graphic design, journalism, and law, who remain skeptical about the threat of automation. "They don't get it," he said. "They describe their job processes, and I tell them, 'You just described exactly what an AI agent can do right now.'" He pointed to the rapid evolution of AI tools, which can now perform tasks like photo editing, video production, and even creative writing with minimal human input. "It's not a question of if AI will make your job obsolete," Adams asserted. "The answer for almost everybody is yes, it will." The implications of this shift are profound. As automation reshapes the workforce, individuals and societies must grapple with how to adapt. Adams urged listeners to consider how they can elevate their roles to stay relevant in an AI-driven world. "The real question is how you can position yourself to stay on top of AI automation," he said. "Otherwise, you risk being thrown into the depopulation category, which is what the globalists are doing." This provocative discussion raises critical questions about the future of work, economic equity, and the role of humanity in an increasingly automated world. While some see depopulation and automation as a pathway to prosperity, others fear it could lead to a dystopian future where human labor is rendered obsolete and global inequality reaches unprecedented levels. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the choices made today will shape the trajectory of societies for generations to come.

As AI and robotics continue to advance, the potential for job displacement across industries is becoming increasingly apparent. Mike Adams, in his broadcast, emphasized that no profession is immune.

Title: Eyes on the prize with history to be made by two of the four clubs in novel All-Ireland finale

Time Published: 2025-01-15T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
For a change, next Sunday’s All-Ireland club finals bring a high degree of novelty. The championship has been through many changes, particularly in more recent years, but the trend towards serial success has at least temporarily come to a halt. Pre-pandemic, Corofin became in 2020 the first club to win three successive All-Irelands and, but for the pandemic, Ballyhale Shamrocks might well have emulated them in the abandoned year that followed, in 2021. This weekend, for the first time in 32 years, all four clubs are appearing at this stage for the first time. You could argue that both the Cuala footballers and Na Fianna hurlers are simply following in the footsteps of the “other code” within their clubs. The Dalkey team won back-to-back All-Ireland hurling titles in 2017 and 2018, whereas Na Fianna were football finalists in 2000. To hold that against the current teams would be nit-picking, as they will be representing the historically less-fashionable side of their respective houses. Cuala’s defeat of Kilmacud in the county final was their first football title, just as Na Fianna, who skinned the same opponents with a dying-seconds goal in their final, were collecting only a second Dublin hurling championship. Their respective opponents in Croke Park, Errigal Ciarán and Sarsfields, are uncomplicatedly first-timers. Errigal are actually Tyrone’s first contestants in the senior club final, maybe surprisingly given their success at intercounty level in the past two decades as well as the strike rate of their junior and intermediate clubs – 11 finals and four titles – at national level in the same time frame. Sarsfields didn’t even emerge from Cork as champions, having lost comprehensively to Imokilly in the final. But their opponents’ status as a divisional side – barred from provincial competition – cleared the way for them to contest Munster. Their performances stunned observers, especially in the final when they burned off regular champions Ballygunner in the early stages and maintained the heat as the match progressed. A Cork side had reached the Munster final just once in the previous 14 years and you had to go back a further seven seasons for the once-dominant county’s most recent title, Newtownshandrum in 2009. It had been eight seasons since a club from the county had even won a single match in Munster. Theirs has been a story of triumph in adversity and not just on the field. In 2023, Storm Babet brought floods that destroyed their pitch in Riverstown. For a year they had to couch-surf in neighbouring clubs, their facilities restored only a few months ago. [ Con O’Callaghan inspires Cuala to reach Croke Park deciderOpens in new window ] Should Cuala win on Sunday, they will become only the second club after St Finbarr’s to have lifted both All-Ireland trophies. Their success has been seen as the gauge of Dublin GAA’s reach into the southside suburbs in the 50 years since Kevin Heffernan revived the county as an All-Ireland force. On the eve of a first four-in-a-row in 2018, former captain and manager Tony Hanahoe made the point. “Now that Dublin have arrived and are there, there are two or three generations who won’t ever understand how far down we had gone at that stage. For one who remembers these things, the rise in the interest in the game and the success rate has been astounding. “The greatest example of that is Cuala. If, 30 or 40 years ago, you had attempted to convince me that there would be an All-Ireland winning club from out around Killiney, I’d have laughed in your face.” Na Fianna are based in more traditional territory but both come into the “super club” category, with 3,000 or more members – a reflection on how hard it is to establish a club in Dublin, which fosters outsize catchments. [ Na Fianna of Dublin and Sarsfields of Cork secure first All-Ireland club hurling final appearanceOpens in new window ] The county could become the third to win both club All-Irelands in the same year, following Cork in 1973 (Glen Rovers and Nemo Rangers) and 1979 (Blackrock and Nemo) and Galway in 2006 (Salthill and Portumna). Pride of place in the history of dual All-Ireland challenges has to go, however, to Cork’s St Finbarr’s, who in 1981 reached both finals, beating Walterstown in the football but losing the hurling to Ballyhale. It is now five years since the traditional St Patrick’s Day date went by the board for the club finals. For all the grumbling about how this calendar switch to January has undermined attendances, there were signs that the public were losing interest in the regular March fixture. Fewer than 18,000 attended in the last year of the Patrick’s Day finals and 12 months previously – not helped by arctic weather and Ireland’s rugby Grand Slam decider with England being on television at the same time – just 15,000 made their way down Jones’s Road. It was a far cry from peak crowds at the turn of the century. In 1999 for the Crossmaglen v Ballina and St Joseph’s Doora-Barefield v Rathnure double bill, a record 40,106 turned up. But with the exception of 2004′s Caltra v An Gaeltacht and Newtownshandrum v Dunloy pairing, which drew 38,500, attendances settled in the low 30,000s. The new split season has created pressures for top intercounty players, obliged to go around the clock if their clubs do well. Christmas has always been affected in successful clubs, making a calendar year attractive but, in the consensus view, impractical. On the Irish Independent sports podcast, Birr’s Michael Verney – for all of us, that most dignifying combination of All-Ireland finalist and reporter – gave the hardship argument short shrift. “You hear, isn’t it terrible that players are missing out on Christmas. I can tell you that the players who have to – in inverted commas – ‘sacrifice’ Christmas are the envy of every other club in the country. That is a fact.” By Sunday evening, that process will intensify as two of the weekend’s clubs create history. sean.moran@irishtimes.com Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: New Ireland U-20 head coach Neil Doak looking to build on recent success

Head coach Neil Doak poses for a portrait during the Ireland U-20 squad announcement at PwC HQ in Spencer Dock, Dublin. Photo: Ben McShane/Sportsfile Neil Doak Ireland U-20 head coach Neil Doak has vowed to play rugby that “excites players and spectators” after he named his squad for the Six Nations today. Doak (right), who is coaching his first Six Nations, aims to build on Ireland’s extraordinary run in the competition after back-to-back Grand Slams followed by a second-place finish last year – despite winning four games and drawing one against England, losing out on bonus points. “Ultimately as a coach you have to understand the players. There is no point asking players to do things that they’re not really comfortable with and so we’ll adjust as we go along,” he said. "We'll obviously look at the other teams and see where we can exploit some avenues but from my point of view, I want to play a brand of rugby that excites the players and excites spectators. “We also know that we want to be successful as well. And what we’re got to try and do as coaching staff and as management is help the players be really good problem solvers, give them scenarios, give them a framework that they can sort build things off, make good decisions.” Ireland host England in Cork on Thursday, January 30 and Doak is not worried about the short turnaround, with just over two weeks until the opening game. “It's a short window to try and prepare a team and put it together, so there’s a decent bit of work that has to go into it beforehand. Hugely positive win against Italy pre-Christmas and played Leinster [development XV] last Saturday. "The boys did well with the chopping and changing, which is always difficult and trying to get those combinations and sort of get everybody on the same page, but the players have done very well over the three camps. "I think in the Italy game we scored two or three tries in a short window which took us away from them, but I was hugely impressed with the way that the second-half team in the Leinster development match, dealt with it. “Difficult conditions, a bit of drizzle, it wasn’t as fluid as we had hoped it would be and I thought we showed great character, got into the right areas of the field and we delivered a few times and sort of just kept us in front. It stands us in good stead, especially the back end of the games, that we can deliver points. I was hugely pleased with that 40-minutes.” Connacht academy player Éanna McCarthy was named captain and the Cork-born back-row, along with five returning players from last year’s competition, gives Doak a great leadership group for the tournament. “When we put the squad together and the management together, and tried to build what we were about, for me I’m a bit more action-orientated. I want to get in the middle. "Last week, Éanna was physical, he was direct and we’re going to need that in abundance against England first up. If he can lead from the front, we can get the rest of the squad in behind him and we’ll be in a good spot. “I think if you look at the England squad, I think they’ve maybe nine or 10 back from that World Cup winning squad. For us, that exposure and experience, I think that was good leading into the World Cup last year. "The returning players were able to sit in front of the rest of the squad and just give them an insight of what South Africa was going to be like. How intense it is, game after game after game after game. That experience stood us in good stead. "I think the returning players, they will be key parts to the squad and the success of the squad. Because the younger guys coming in can bounce things off them and get a better understanding of what it is all about.” Ireland U-20 Squad Forwards (17): Billy Bohan (Galway Corinthians RFC/Connacht); Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Michael Foy (UCC RFC/Munster); Conor Kennelly (Highfield RFC/Munster); Connor Magee (Banbridge RFC/Ulster); Tom McAllister (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster); Éanna McCarthy (Galwegians RFC/Connacht) (capt); Alex Mullan (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster); Aaron O’Brien (St Mary’s College RFC/Leinster); Bobby Power (Galwegians RFC/Connacht); Mahon Ronan (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Alan Spicer (UCD RFC/Leinster); Alex Usanov (Clontarf FC/Leinster); Henry Walker (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster); David Walsh (Terenure College RFC/Leinster); Adam Watchorn (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Mikey Yarr (UCD RFC/Leinster) Backs (14): Andrew Doyle (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Connor Fahy (Clontarf FC/Leinster); Paidi Farrell (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Daniel Green (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster); Dylan Hicks (Garryowen FC/Munster); Gene O’Leary Kareem (UCC RFC/Munster); Clark Logan (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster); Ciarán Mangan (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster); Derry Moloney (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster); Charlie Molony (UCD RFC/Leinster); Andre Ryan (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster); Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution FC/Munster); Sam Wisniewski (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster); Will Wootton (Sale Sharks/IQ Rugby)

January 14, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Students used the University of Otago's Bloomberg terminals to research stocks to invest in. Photo / Alex Robertson A trio of finance students at the University of Otago’s Business School technically made a profit of $101,110 from virtual share trading over a five-week period as part of a global competition. Shenjian Li, Mingxuan Yu and Junxiu Lyu invested $1 million of imaginary capital into 55 United States and Canadian listed companies, including BlackRock, Trump Media and Technology Group and an array of finance, technology, commodity and pharmaceutical-related companies. They followed an earnings-based investment strategy, holding no more than five stocks at a time and selling them for a gain or loss after those companies released their financial reports. The total payoff was equal to an annualised return of about 162%, putting them in the top 11% of the Bloomberg market trading challenge in which they competed against more than 2000 teams from universities across 46 countries. “It’s the sort of [investment] performance that professional hedge fund managers would like to obtain in their funds,” Otago Professor Emeritus of finance Timothy Falcon Crack said. The students used the University of Otago’s Bloomberg terminals to research their investments through company earnings reports, financial analyst reports and news articles. “Even though it wasn’t real money, we still had to make decisions based on real-world data and could only buy and sell stocks in the Bloomberg Lab,” student Junxiu Lyu said. Their investment returns dropped 10% in the second week of the challenge but they still held their stock positions. “Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night to check [our investments], and one day I saw 15% losses,” student Shenjian Li said. They were the only New Zealand team to enter the competition and beat all the Australian teams. The team, called Otago Alpha, placed 262nd overall among 2453 teams from 383 universities. They were mentored by senior finance lecturer Dr Olena Onishchenko. Plus: The hottest stocks investors are buying.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties.

Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 9.33.07 AM.jpeg The Nifty’s bounce yesterday has created a “bullish harami” formation given the Monday drop which is similar to what was seen on January 7 and means that bulls have to push the index through 23340 for a larger advance. The 17th to 23rd January time window is nearing, so support in the 22830 - 23000 area and resistance in the 23355 - 23470 zone will be watched closely. While our prop oscillators on the daily and the weekly continue to be bearish, the former has now entered oversold territory.

In view of ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India aims to boost its textile and garments industry in next month’s budget with financial support, tariff cuts on key inputs and incentives to produce locally, two government sources said.

Moreover the government is likely to forecast nominal economic growth of 10.3 per cent-10.5 per cent, according to one of the officials. That’s higher than the forecast of 9.7 per cent for the current year to end-March given by the government’s statistical department this month.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY). NFO Period: 16th January –30th January, 2025 Bengaluru, January 14, 2025: Groww Mutual Fund has introduced the Groww Nifty India Railways PSU ETF, aiming to offer retail investors the opportunity to invest in the Indian Railways ecosystem, a fundamental pillar of India’s infrastructure. The NFO period of the scheme is from 16-30 January, 2025 This ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Nifty India Railways PSU Index -TRI, comprising Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) essential to the railways sector, spanning infrastructure, financial services, logistics, and technology. Capitalizing on India’s Growth Story* Indian Railways is critical to the country’s transportation and logistics ecosystem, with a vast network spanning 68,584 km and over 7,325 stations. It facilitates seamless transportation for 6.7 billion passengers annually—equivalent to the world’s population—and handles 27% of India’s freight movement. The sector is undergoing a significant transformation, supported by a record ₹2.52 lakh crore in government capital expenditure for FY 2024-25. Initiatives include the transition to safer, more efficient rolling stock, station upgrades, high-speed rail projects, and the adoption of renewable energy solutions like solar installations, aligning with sustainability goals while reducing operational costs. In adherence to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, Punjab National Bank (PNB), nation’s leading public sector bank, urges its customers to update their “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information by 23.01.2025 to ensure smooth functioning of their accounts. This is applicable only for those customers whose accounts were due for KYC updation as of 30.09.2024. As part of the KYC compliance exercise, PNB customers are requested to provide their updated information like identity proof, address proof, recent photo, PAN/Form 60, income proof, mobile number (if not available) or any other KYC information at any branch. It can also be done through PNB ONE/Internet Banking Services (IBS) or registered e-mail/post to their base branch by 23.01.2025. Failure to update KYC details within the stipulated time may result in restrictions on account operations. “The WPI inflation expectedly rose to 2.4% in December 2024 from 1.9% in November 2024, while printing slightly lower than ICRA’s estimate (+2.6%). The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

Read more Gold prices steadied in yesterday’s session, as market participants digested latest US inflation data as well as a report on President-elect Donald Trump’s planned trade tariffs. US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today.

Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY).

The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

Title: Will There Be A DeFi Cycle In This Crypto Bull Run?

Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images As the crypto market enters a new phase of bullish momentum, the question on everyone's mind is whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) will once again take center stage. While the DeFi boom of 2020 catalyzed the broader blockchain ecosystem, this cycle may take a more evolved and measured approach, emphasizing utility and long-term sustainability. DeFi has transcended its experimental origins to become a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized infrastructure, it has democratized access to financial services for millions of people worldwide. DeFi isn’t a fringe experiment anymore, but a proven disruptor. In 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people were unbanked, and another billion were underbanked. DeFi offered a pathway to financial inclusion, enabling users to bypass traditional gatekeepers. Today, stablecoins anchor the market, and DeFi lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and staking protocols have changed how capital flows for good. To evaluate the possibility of a DeFi cycle, we need to examine the current market dynamics. The ongoing bull run has seen a resurgence in Bitcoin and large cap asset prices, with total market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion USD. However, DeFi’s growth hinges on more than just market optimism. The rise in DeFi TVL has brought on several new innovative solutions in the market. Among the emerging players shaping this next phase is Nudge, a company introducing a new primitive in the DeFi ecosystem: programmable incentive payments called “nudges.” According to Markus Maier, co-founder of Nudge, “Nudges are programmable incentive payments that allow protocols to pay users for reallocating assets, liquidity, or activity on-chain. Think of it as getting paid—or ‘nudged’—to shift your assets, change to a staking provider, or start using a new Layer 2 solution.” Nudge’s approach, termed “reallocation primitives,” represents a shift in how resources are utilized across DeFi platforms. Users can earn rewards for reallocating their assets while protocols gain measurable and scalable tools for user acquisition and retention. This concept moves beyond traditional token rewards, offering a more targeted and efficient mechanism for ecosystem growth. “The inspiration behind nudges,” Maier adds, “was the crowded landscape of protocols competing for the same pool of users and capital. By enabling users to earn from reallocating their resources, we create new incentives that align their actions with the broader ecosystem’s success.” Other rising players include Convex Finance and Tokemak. Convex Finance, built on top of Curve Finance, enhances yield opportunities for liquidity providers and Curve stakers by streamlining rewards and boosting incentives. Tokemak, on the other hand, serves as a decentralized liquidity provider, optimizing capital deployment across the ecosystem with its unique liquidity reactors. While retail-centric DeFi solutions like Nudge aim to make financial tools more accessible to individual users, there is another category of DeFi applications that focuses on institutional utilities, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. For example, Singapore's Project Guardian explores institutional DeFi by experimenting with tokenized bonds and deposits to assess the potential of decentralized financial infrastructures. Backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), it aims to integrate tokenized assets with permissioned liquidity pools, providing a secure and scalable blueprint for institutional adoption. One of the critical factors influencing the future of DeFi is regulation. As governments worldwide grapple with the challenges of overseeing decentralized systems, the impact of new policies on DeFi cannot be overstated. Regulatory clarity could either propel DeFi into mainstream adoption or stifle its growth. Recent developments suggest a mixed bag for the industry. The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)regulation aims to create a comprehensive framework for crypto assets, including DeFi protocols. While this offers a path toward legitimacy, critics argue that overly stringent requirements could hinder innovation. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ramped up its scrutiny of DeFi platforms, emphasizing the need for compliance with existing securities laws. This has prompted many projects to consider decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structures to navigate regulatory hurdles. "While regulation is necessary, it must be balanced to foster innovation," says Maier. For a more in-depth look at regulatory considerations, I recommend reviewing the Key Elements of an Effective DeFi Framework, published by the Crypto Council of Innovation in which I was a co-author. Here, we have outlined the principles for crafting policies that encourage innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. Several factors could reignite a DeFi cycle in this bull run: “The next DeFi cycle will prioritize utility over hype,” added Maier. While uncertainties around regulation and market sentiment persist, the fundamentals of DeFi remain strong. With innovative platforms like Nudge leading the way and continued advancements in blockchain technology, the stage is set for a potential DeFi resurgence in this bull run. The next few months will be crucial in determining whether DeFi can overcome its challenges and reclaim its position as a driving force in the crypto ecosystem. One Community. Many Voices.

Today's revolutions in mobile computing get all the glory, but the best desktop PCs endure. Whether for high-powered gaming, rendering complex 3D scenes, or crunching data-drenched spreadsheets, the best desktops still do it better. At PCMag, we've tested thousands of desktops since our beginnings in 1982, and our analysts and editors represent more than a century of experience in desktop testing and reviews. We use standardized methodologies to measure CPU and graphics performance against relevant comparison PCs and assess all models on design, usability, upgradability, connectivity, and more. Our reviews encompass business PCs and workstations, gaming PCs, all-in-ones, and even mini PCs. Our current pick for the best mainstream desktop PC for most people is the 2024 Dell XPS Desktop for its budget-to-high-end configurations and expansive, high-style case. Below, see the rest of our always-shifting recommendations, followed by a deep-dive buying guide on everything to factor into your desktop purchase. With the highly versatile XPS Desktop 8960 for 2024, Dell remains a top dog of desktops. Dell configured our review unit as a high-end tower with lots of graphics oomph, which ripped through just about every benchmark we put it through. With an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics card inside, it's also ready to ramp up for game time. However, we also picked it for its versatility in configurations. Starting at just $800, this desktop shows impressive range in the kinds of customers it can serve. If you desire a high-end desktop for more than gaming, stop looking: The latest Dell XPS Desktop is here. Not only is it ready for just about any task you can throw its way, but Dell's XPS Desktop case also leaves room for a decent amount of upgrades and an ample port selection. It's also available in far more affordable configurations, opening this product up to aspirational upgraders who want to start small. What is the price of the Dell XPS Desktop 8960 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Acer has developed a bit of a value dynasty for itself, with the previous title holder's direct successor now atop our list as the best desktop for most people. The Acer Aspire TC-1780-UA92 takes what the 1760 model accomplished and levels it up with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor inside paired with 8GB of memory and the same 512GB SSD capacity. With the Aspire TC-1780-UA92, Acer stands above every budget tower we’ve tested since. Its sub-$600 starting price nets you plenty of power, space for upgrades, and modern amenities like a front USB-C port and card reader, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, and dual HDMI ports for two monitors. Yet again, anyone seeking the best PC for their family or household with a tight budget will be served well by this Acer model. Its value-oriented array of components continues to be better than what we see from most budget PCs, and it includes features found in high-end machines not too long ago. Expect this Acer tower to be a reliable daily driver for years after purchase. What is the price of the Acer Aspire TC-1780-UA92 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? MSI handily took the budget gaming rig crown with its Codex R2 model, a sub-$1,000 desktop with modern features, competent performance, and lots of room for expansion. The Codex nails all of the criteria we value in entry-level gaming PCs, particularly allowing you to invest in the product down the line with upgrades to core components like the CPU and GPU in addition to memory and storage. It's also competitively priced for the hardware it houses, able to serve up 1440p performance for less than a grand. Budget-bound PC gamers who don't want to sacrifice performance and get more out of their new gaming desktop than their 1080p or 4K console setup can muster should seriously consider the MSI Codex R2. This is one of the most affordable entries into 1440p gaming that we've seen, making it an instant recommendation for frugal buyers. What is the price of the MSI Codex R2 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Known primarily for its high-performance components and gaming PC cases, Corsair's years-old foray into complete systems has resulted in one of the best PCs we've seen for compact gaming. Don't be fooled by this diminutive desktop's dashing wood-paneled design: The Corsair One i500 packs an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU that topped our benchmark charts, thanks in no small part to its high-efficiency, liquid-cooled parts inside. Plus, the One i500's components are all upgradable despite its small frame, even the GPU, though you'll need to mail in the tower for that. To get so much power out of such a space-friendly design, we think that once-a-generation process is worth it when the RTX 4090 eventually gets surpassed. Anyone looking for the best desktop for compact gaming and having the cash to make their dream come true should consider the Corsair One i500 before looking further. If you don't like the wood paneling, Corsair sells a metal-paneled version to match your aesthetic. Also, despite this PC clearing $3,000, you might be shocked to learn it's better-priced than most gaming rigs housing an RTX 4090. What is the price of the Corsair One i500 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Skipping the M3 generation of processors proved well worth it for Apple's miniature Mac. The latest Mac mini takes on Apple's M4 processors to incredible effect, particularly in the M4 Pro we tested for our review. The M4 Pro Mac mini blew away like-configured mini desktops and challenged workstations several times its size in some tests. This is before even getting to Apple's redesign, which introduced more ports and better cooling. Whether at its starting budget-priced configuration or tricked out to get serious work done, the new Mac mini is a no-brainer. What's so impressive about the new Mac mini is its ability to serve widely different audiences. It's one of the best budget desktops, starting at just $599 with the M4 chip, 16GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD. At $1,399, it becomes a pint-size M4 Pro powerhouse ready to compete with legitimate workstations. You don't see that kind of value versatility in most desktops. What is the price of the Apple Mac Mini M4 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Versatility is king when recommending a PC to all sorts of general users, and it doesn't get much more adaptable in the desktop space than the HP Envy Move. This all-in-one is designed to move around the home, with a lightweight design that includes a handle and self-deploying feet. It can be used in any room as needed with relative ease, thanks to the included keyboard with a built-in touchpad, and even an internal battery for a few hours off the charger. The Move includes a capable 13th Gen Intel processor, a bright 23.8-inch 1440p display, and a decent webcam, so as to not diminish its capacity as a normal desktop. The reasonable pricing helps, too. If you're a casual, everyday user looking for an all-in-one desktop, you should be happy with this one. For those of you who may not make extensive use of the mobility, we'd still recommend it as an effective general-use AIO. For those who may want to move it around the house or office, it's painless to do so, and various family members can enjoy it for a range of tasks. Just note that the performance doesn't hit the higher end of some more potent AIOs, if that's what you need. What is the price of the HP Envy Move in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? You won't find a huge swath of business-focused AIOs, but HP's EliteOne 870 G9 is the best in class right now. Its sharp professional design and quiet operation are an ideal fit for an office, while its excellent performance and clear webcam can produce what you need to work effectively. Its speakers are loud, and the base stand features wireless charging, as a bonus. A hearty collection of ports rounds out this well-balanced machine. AIOs are not always the most cost-effective solution versus more traditional PCs, so from that perspective, you may consider towers and standalone monitors for fleet deployment. You can service the tower separately from the monitor, should one go bad, while everything is tied together here. If this design still makes more sense for your business, though, the included 1080p webcam is a big plus for home or office workers, as is the support for Windows Hello logins. What is the price of the HP EliteOne 870 G9 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Asus' NUC 14 Pro is the best current mini PC overall, carrying Intel's NUC torch into the future. This mighty little puck is ready for desks at home or in the office, with specific models featuring an Intel Core Ultra chip with vPro security for added peace of mind. With a comprehensive set of options for connectivity and upgradability, not to mention mounting hardware for stowing behind a monitor, this NUC revival is the most impressive mini PC we've reviewed in some time. This next NUC fits for anyone looking to fill a home office or cubicle with a tiny but punchy PC that can drive through basic productivity work. If you're seeking a PC that can disappear easily into a desk setup and accept upgrades to maximize its effective life, seriously consider the Asus NUC 14 Pro. What is the price of the Asus NUC 14 Pro in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? While we tested it at a much more potent configuration, Dell's Precision 3680 starts at a much more approachable price. This is an incredibly scalable workstation since its case needs to accommodate all of those possible levels of performance, and it features options for error-correcting-code (ECC) memory, which is essential for work in industrial control applications, critical databases, and infrastructural memory caches where data errors can be much more dire. What makes the Precision 3680 so easy to recommend is that it's applicable to many tiers of professional computing work, from an entry-level workstation to a top-tier tower of power ready to churn intense rendering and AI workloads. This desktop's effectiveness and value depend significantly on how you configure it for your computing needs before checkout, which puts a lot of power in your hands. What is the price of the Dell Precision 3680 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? This is one of the most potent mini desktop workstations we've tested, with impressive performance from a 3.9-liter chassis. Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF got on this list by achieving the diminutive size we look for from mini PCs without compromising too much on speed. Given the desktop's small size, we also appreciate the antenna-free Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios. This desktop also starts at less than $1,000 and can scale up far past what our review configuration provides—a major plus. Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF is another highly scalable workstation, though it's a much tighter affair inside. You could upgrade this desktop for at least another generation. ECC memory helps future-proof the system and makes it capable of working in industries with zero tolerance for data corruption. What is the price of the Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? To help you make the best decision in your search for the best desktop, we've gathered a list of the most frequently asked questions surrounding the topic, as well as a few more unsolicited but helpful facts to inform your choice. Below that, you'll find a condensed list of the above recommendations for easier spec comparisons. We've reviewed an impressive variety of the best desktops above, right? We don't deny that a laptop or tablet is a better pick for people who depend on business travel or whose computing consists mostly of basic surfing and typing from the living-room couch. But desktops are often the best choice and the best value for small offices, families, creative pros, gamers, and tech tinkerers. While the best desktops don't come in as many distinct form factors as laptops, you'll find lots of variation in computing power and room for upgrades and expansion. The key is to spend as little as possible to get exactly what you want or need out of your next desktop computer, whether that's a suitable budget buy or a high-power PC with a price tag to match. Reliability is a nebulous concept when it comes to computers: It could mean consistency of performance, or it could also mean the strength and support of its warranty, just to name two interpretations. Certain brands have developed reputations for reliability, namely computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. But no single brand can lay a blanket claim to any such title. Since that might not be the most satisfying answer to such a question, we also have our Readers’ Choice coverage of the desktops category, which polls readers like you to determine widely held opinions on the various desktop options out there. Once you have winnowed down models based on other, more solid criteria, the wisdom of the crowd might help you develop an idea of the most reliable brands to count on in your search for the best PC for you. One of the best desktops' most alluring promises is the value they deliver. With desktop PCs and their components, your money simply goes further. Instead of buying a $700 laptop with a competent Intel Core i5 or Ultra 5 processor, you can get a $700 desktop with a more powerful Core i7 or Ultra 7 CPU and maybe even a dedicated graphics card. You can find complete mini PCs for super light work and display-signage tasks for less than $400 and perfectly serviceable small towers for $300 to $600. Gaming desktops with dedicated graphics cards start at around $700. You can also find all-in-one desktops, with the display and all of the computing components built into a single device, starting at around $400. The thing with desktops is that opting for a cheap one does not carry some of the same risks you'd face with a like-priced laptop. A $250 Black Friday special or a steeply discounted refurbished desktop could perform just fine for basic computing, and you wouldn't need to worry about the wear and tear on cheap materials that you might with a laptop of a similar price. That inexpensive laptop would be subject to the vagaries of daily commuting and the occasional drop from a coffee table. The desktop, in contrast, would need to stay put and just work. At the top end of the market are business workstations, tricked-out gaming rigs, and magnificently engineered all-in-one PCs that cost several thousand dollars. Not only will a $3,000 gaming tower provide immense computing power today, but it should come with so much room for expansion and potential for upgradability that its useful life will be far longer than any laptop. And that's before you even delve into the wild world of custom PCs: automotive-grade paint jobs, liquid cooling, and fanciful lighting and wiring. IT-manageable, security-conscious business desktops—most of them nowadays made by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own pricing dynamic and tend to cost more, all else being equal. That's because of their premium warranty or support plans, as well as the possible addition of enterprise-specific silicon focused on manageability or security. Sometimes, part of the cost premium of business desktops reflects the PC maker’s guarantee that it will stock replacement components and upgrades for that line of machines for a fixed future period. That allows IT pros to count on the ability to continue servicing a fleet of a given business machine over that period. The Mac versus PC debate is one of the oldest in modern technology, and we're not going to pick a side or try to settle that particular religious war here. But if you're not wedded to one or the other by years of habit (or the peripherals and software you own) and are open to switching, here's a quick rundown of your choices. Windows 11 is the latest iteration of Microsoft's operating system. Most people typically rely on desktops that use it and previous versions of the OS, so you'll be assured of the best compatibility and the widest selection of third-party software. Desktops running Windows are also readily available below $500, making them attractive to casual users, families looking for a second PC, and bargain hunters. Macs are an excellent choice if you're already in an Apple-centric household since macOS is seamlessly compatible with iPads and iPhones. You can also send and receive messages on any device connected to your iCloud account. However, the cost of entry will be higher than with the least expensive PCs. Google's ChromeOS is a viable alternative to Windows and macOS, but desktops running it (called Chromeboxes) are rare and best suited to niche uses like powering a restaurant menu display. A fourth option is to buy a desktop with no operating system at all and install an open-source one of your choosing, such as Ubuntu Linux. We don't recommend going this route unless you're technically savvy, willing to experiment, and OK with fixing software compatibility issues and other quirks. Macs and Windows PCs are available in all three of the major desktop form factors: mini PCs that can fit on a bookshelf, sleek all-in-ones with built-in (and usually high-resolution) displays, and traditional desktop towers that are bulky but have room for more expansion. These three forms each have strengths and weaknesses, and none of them is an obvious best choice for everyone. You'll have to choose based on what you plan to do with your desktop and where you plan to put it. For truly cramped quarters, light workloads, and people who love the efficient use of space, a mini PC could be the best choice. They come in sizes ranging from tiny sticks not much larger than a USB thumb drive to small-form-factor (SFF) towers that may be nearly a foot tall but have compact footprints. The smallest sizes have the benefit of disappearing behind an HDMI-equipped monitor or TV, and they contain a processor, memory, storage, and ports to hook up keyboards and mice. They're economical and power-efficient, and they can serve as adequate web browsing or multimedia viewing platforms. But know that the models at the truly tiny end of the scale have no room for adding extra internal components, and their preinstalled parts are usually difficult or impossible to upgrade. Regardless, you can find a fair mix of what qualifies as mini PCs that can be customized or upgraded with better components. They're bigger than the "stick"-style PCs but much more flexible and expandable. Traditional tower desktops are capable of even more flexibility but also bring a lot more bulk. Nowadays, the differences between midsize and full-size towers are less well-defined, and some of the new PC case designs—from cubes to glass boxes—defy easy categorization. Still, nearly all desktop towers have generous amounts of interior space and full-size (a.k.a. ATX) motherboards, so you can install one or more (sometimes, many more) secondary storage drives, more RAM in empty slots on the motherboard, a video card if one isn't installed, and in some remote cases, even a second graphics card for extreme gaming or graphics-accelerated tasks. (Note that not all desktop mini towers and towers can take a graphics upgrade. That is where reviews come in.) An all-in-one (AIO) desktop is quite a different animal from both of these form factors. An AIO can save you some space since the display is built in. An AIO's value proposition comes down to space saving and whether you are shopping for a desktop display simultaneously. Though you can find budget AIOs with basic feature sets, lower resolutions, and non-touch screens, many new models include touch-enabled screens, and some AIO panels have exceptionally high native resolutions of 4K (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) or even 5K (5,120 by 2,880 pixels). Touch displays make them excellent choices for watching movies or serving as a multimedia hub in the kitchen or other public areas of your home, though the absolute highest resolutions target content creators rather than consumers. With a few exceptions for business-oriented models, you will give up a lot of room for expansion in an AIO versus a traditional desktop tower. Cracking open an AIO for an upgrade or fix, while not impossible, is a bigger deal than opening the side of a desktop tower. Apple's recent iMacs are particularly difficult to open. One of the main benefits of a desktop tower is that it will use a desktop-grade CPU. That may sound obvious, but it's a key distinction. AMD and Intel, the two biggest makers of PC processors, provide desktop-class and laptop-class chips to system manufacturers, but often, the CPU model names are similar and tricky to tell apart. For example, you will see Intel's Core i7 in laptops and desktops, but having a "true" desktop CPU versus one made for a mobile device makes a big performance difference. A desktop CPU gives you more power for complex content-creation work, PC gaming, or math and scientific projects. Faster processors with four, six, eight, or even as many as 18 cores will benefit software written to take advantage of the extra cores. The desktop version of a given CPU will consume more power and generate more heat than versions designed for laptops, which must be incorporated into environments that have less thermal and power-delivery leeway. A desktop CPU also has greater wiggle room to incorporate a key feature, multithreading, that allows each of the CPU's cores to address two processing threads at a time instead of just one. When engaged with suitably equipped software, multithreading (which Intel calls "Hyper-Threading") can deliver a major performance boost. The best desktop chips may require liquid cooling systems, limiting their use to high-end towers with lots of interior space. Processors in these families are specialized and expensive, and you’ll only want them if you have specific software needs that you know, explicitly, can leverage their higher base and peak clock rates, as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not casual purchases. Conversely, many AIOs and mini PCs use the same efficient, cooler-running types of CPUs that you'll find in laptops. Intel typically labels these mobile-first chip designs with a CPU name containing "U" or "H," whereas most desktop chips instead have a "T" or a "K" or just a zero at the end. A mobile CPU might have the same number of processor cores as its desktop counterpart (four- and six-core chips are common in both), but its maximum power consumption will often be far lower. Also, the typical base and boost clock speeds may be lower, and the chip may not support multithreading. Regardless, many desktop PC buyers will be fine with these lower-powered CPUs for everyday work and a little more. For a typical tower using a true desktop-grade CPU, mainstream users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful choices, but overkill for most folks who aren’t serious PC gamers, intense multitaskers, or prosumer video or image manipulators. If CPU power is critically important, though, these should suffice. The Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series are worthwhile only if you know too few cores or threads are holding back your workflow, or you have extreme needs in terms of internal storage (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources). Again, see our deep dive on desktop CPUs to understand the nuances of these higher-end choices. Look out for Intel "Arrow Lake" Core Ultra processors to start hitting desktops soon after their launch in late 2024. These are the first Intel desktop chips with neural processing units for dedicating AI crunching. All computers have a CPU, but most laptops and many cheaper desktops don't have a dedicated graphics processor or GPU. Instead, their display output comes from a portion of the CPU, a slice of silicon known as an integrated graphics processor (IGP). An IGP is fine for basic tasks, such as checking your email, browsing the web, or even streaming videos. Doing productivity work on an IGP is completely within bounds. Indeed, most business desktops rely on IGPs. In any case, an IGP is not the answer for anyone who wants to run intensive 3D games, render architectural simulations, or perhaps train an artificial intelligence algorithm. These situations—especially games, but often pro-grade apps, too—can benefit from more muscular graphics. Times like these call for a graphics card, which will bring its own GPU to the game, and the most powerful of these are found in the best PCs for gaming. Choosing a graphics card is a complex affair. Gamers should consider the capabilities of their monitor first. A 4K monitor or one with a high refresh rate (144Hz or greater) will require a profoundly powerful GPU (or occasionally even two GPUs) to display games at the monitor's maximum potential. If you're just looking to do some middle-of-the-road gaming on a 1080p monitor (and not looking to win any professional esports crowns), a mainstream card will do just fine. Meanwhile, creative professionals and other power users should consider the graphics-acceleration recommendations of the apps they plan to run, using the software maker's system requirements as a guide. Graphics-accelerated video rendering or AI programs can benefit from the same types of GPUs as intensive 3D games. Professionals eyeing workstations will want to consider Nvidia's RTX A series lineup or AMD's Radeon Pro models. Check out our deep-dive guide to graphics cards for much more on the nuances of today's video cards. While powerful CPUs and GPUs are mostly relegated to desktop towers, nearly every desktop form factor can handle copious amounts of storage and memory. This is thanks to the advent of higher-capacity memory modules, especially solid-state drives (SSDs). The latter take up vastly less space than the spinning hard drives of old. It's still possible to find desktops with only spinning hard drives, but we recommend avoiding these and choosing an SSD as the main boot drive whenever possible. Some desktops feature a single-drive combination of an SSD and a hard drive. A "true" SSD is the only way to go as a boot drive today, though, considering how far prices have dropped in the last couple of years. A single 500GB or 512GB SSD is fine for most users. A 250GB or 256GB SSD is also a common size for a boot drive these days, but it's a little tight if you store much locally. Anyone with large media and game collections will want to consider several terabytes of storage across multiple drives. Consider choosing a fast SSD as the boot drive and one or more large-capacity but slower hard drives for bulk storage of capacity-sapping video or games. A typical configuration in this case is one 512GB SSD and one or more hard drives with at least 1TB of space on each. Such a setup can be more affordable than you might think—an SSD plus one hard drive is sometimes seen on under-$1,000 desktop towers. If you think you'll add storage later, consider how many expansion bays your desktop has. A combination of two or more 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch bays should be enough, as these can accommodate any type of traditional SSD or hard drive. You'll also want to ensure your desktop has at least one M.2 slot to accept a PCI Express SSD as the main boot drive since that will enable the fastest throughput speeds. The boot drive will come as an M.2 drive in most new systems. These drives are quite small, the size and thickness of a stick of gum. While a desktop's SSD stores your data, its system memory (or RAM) works with the CPU to run apps and helps define its capacity to multitask. Memory capacities of 8GB or 16GB are fine for most users, and these are the most common configurations on entry-level or midrange desktops of all forms and sizes. Few people will see much benefit from memory amounts above 16GB, but you'll find exceptions. Gaming PCs above the budget level should have at least 16GB of RAM, and 32GB is a prudent upgrade for esports hounds who want to play and simultaneously edit and stream in-game footage. Finally, assuming your professional software can address higher memory amounts, professional workstations should have at least 32GB of memory with error-correcting code (ECC) capabilities to keep everything running smoothly. In that case, you'll want to follow the software maker's guidance. You might be able to excuse a relative lack of input and output ports on a sleek AIO. The screen and speakers are built-in, and you'll likely use a wireless keyboard and mouse, anyway. But mini PCs and desktop towers need the right selection of ports. At a minimum, they'll have to connect to a display, speakers or headphones, and a power source. On all but the absolute tiniest mini PCs, you should look for at least three USB 3.0 (or higher) ports, at least one of which should be the newer, oval-shaped Type-C variety if you have any compatible peripherals that plug directly into that kind of port. Future-proofers will want to seek out USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 options, which both use the Type-C standard with increased speeds and bandwidth. Expect to see the even-faster Thunderbolt 5 standard pop up more in the future, as Apple's Macs have already adopted it in their desktops featuring M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. You'll also typically find an HDMI output (and perhaps another video output or two, such as DisplayPort or VGA), a 3.5mm audio jack, a connector for an external Wi-Fi antenna, and a receptacle for a physical lock. Note that some mini PCs use scaled-down "mini" versions of HDMI or DisplayPort, which require a different kind of input cable or a dongle. Make sure the machine's video outputs are compatible with your display and its cabling. Larger tower PCs will have many more ports, providing support for pretty much any peripheral you need to connect. Expect six or more USB ports, for starters. On larger towers, one or two of these should support Thunderbolt over USB-C. Also, a given: an Ethernet jack for wired networking and multiple DisplayPort and HDMI jacks on the dedicated GPU for connecting one or more external monitors. Note that a tower with a graphics card may also have video outputs that stem from the motherboard, but you should only use the video outputs on the GPU. Many towers will also have multiple audio ports, including possibly an optical output and ports for individual speaker channels in a surround-sound setup. Make sure that these match up with any gear you may have; the number of surround-sound jacks can vary depending on the PC and its motherboard. Note that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, while reliably present on even the cheapest laptops and many smaller desktops, is not a given on larger towers. High-end workstations and gaming desktops sometimes have a second Ethernet port for doubling network bandwidth or for always-connected redundancy, while business desktops sometimes include legacy connectors such as VGA video outputs, PS/2 peripheral ports, or serial ports. The throwback-style ports are included for people who still need to use them with older, specialized hardware such as point-of-sale scanners or industrial equipment. Of course, you can buy dongles and adapters for these special port needs, but the possibility of having them built in is a key benefit of choosing a desktop over a laptop. When evaluating a desktop, beyond looking at what ports are present, also evaluate where they are. Are they easily accessible? Towers tend to have a few commonly used ports on the top or front (usually a headphone jack and a few USB ports). Some AIOs, in contrast, have some of their key ports hidden behind the stand in hard-to-reach places. Some buying concerns, no less crucial than the ones above, apply only to certain types of desktops. For instance, deciding on a screen size and type is critical for AIO shoppers. A touch-enabled display with support for in-plane switching (IPS) to widen viewing angles is welcome for an AIO that serves as the family's calendar or photo album, but know that touch support is not currently available on Apple's iMacs. Give some deep thought to the screen resolution, whatever the panel size. A 4K or even 5K resolution makes for a breathtaking screen, especially one that's 27 inches or larger, but such resolutions often add significantly to the price. As a result, you may want to settle for a screen with a full HD or 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) native resolution and spend money to upgrade other components instead. Also, look for multiple cameras, one facing the rear, that could make an AIO a smart choice, say, for an ID-card printing station. Fan noise is also a consideration with AIO since their computing components will be on your desk instead of hidden underneath it. The best desktop towers have many idiosyncrasies. Enthusiasts who like to tinker with components but aren't interested in building their own best PCs from scratch will need to pay special attention to the number and type of expansion bays and how easily they can access power and data cables. They should also check the maximum wattage rating of the power supply unit (PSU) and whether the case has the clearance for bigger coolers (or the mounting points for liquid cooling gear) if they plan to add a more powerful CPU later on. A low-wattage PSU, such as a 300-watt model used in a desktop with integrated graphics, might preclude adding a graphics card later on without upgrading the PSU, too. Note also that some ultra-budget desktop PCs use low-wattage, custom-design PSUs that can't support a graphics card and also aren't easy to upgrade due to their use of nonstandard connectors on the motherboard side. Again, this is where a careful reading of reviews comes in. Desktop towers and mini PCs also require separate speakers or headphones to deliver audio. If you don’t already have them, you'll have to spend extra money to buy some, and in the case of dedicated speakers, they'll take up room on your desk. For people who don't care as much about audio quality and just want loud enough audio to hear family members on the other end of a Skype call, the built-in speakers of an AIO should work just fine. There is no single best time to buy for most people in the market for an inexpensive desktop tower. While traditional sale holidays such as Black Friday can net you the odd bargain, when you find a system whose features, price, and performance match what you're looking for, take it home. However, people who need copious amounts of CPU or GPU muscle (and who have a clear idea of what hardware moves the performance needle with the apps they use) should pay attention to PC-component release cycles. Traditionally, Intel has announced new desktop CPU generations once a year, with the new chips showing up in PCs in the fall or early in the holiday shopping period. (This has shown more variance in recent years.) New graphics card releases are less frequent and depend on the vagaries of technical advances—Nvidia's highly successful GeForce GTX 1000 series, for example, was the cutting edge for several years before the first GeForce RTX cards were announced. Keeping track of PC component release cycles helps you become aware of what's new before you buy and also what is going off-market. For shoppers seeking maximum value or on a tight budget, getting a desktop based on a discounted last-generation (but still powerful) CPU or GPU can be the way to go. Meanwhile, shoppers looking for an all-in-one PC should pay attention to Apple's announcements. Many other manufacturers copy—and, sometimes, improve upon—the field-leading designs of the Apple iMac. Since you won’t be lugging a desktop around nearly as much as you would a laptop, it’s less important to handle the chassis and test-drive its build quality in the store before you bring it home. Still, if the desktop comes with peripherals included, it can be helpful to type a few lines and move the mouse around in the store. Setting eyes on an all-in-one desktop is more crucial than with a typical tower desktop or mini PC. The screen is an integral part of what you are buying, and eyes-on time matters, especially if you’re not well-versed, say, in the differences between a 24-inch and 27-inch panel or a 1080p screen versus a 4K one. If you limit yourself only to the selection at your local electronics outlet, though, you’ll miss out on many excellent desktops. Some configurations can be exclusive to a single reseller, such as Best Buy, Costco, or Walmart. Other merchants, such as Micro Center, frequently have in-store-only deals that aren't available anywhere online. This is where return policies come in handy. If you find the best desktop for you online but can't test drive it locally, a seller with a liberal return policy is your best friend. Just make sure you've got adequate time to return it if it doesn't work out. Most desktop makers provide one-year warranties on parts and labor, with extensions available for as many as five years at an additional charge. Before you pay to extend the warranty, though, check your credit card account benefits guide—your issuer might cover mishaps for a short period after you buy a new product and possibly extend the manufacturer's warranty, too. (For example, many MasterCard accounts include a doubling of the standard warranty period, up to one year.) If your card issuer doesn’t cover you and you plan on keeping your desktop for several years, look into the cost of added coverage. Some manufacturers and resellers offer a wide range of extended warranties; expect to spend $100 to $300 for one of these options. Our rule of thumb is that if a warranty costs more than 15% of the desktop’s purchase price, you're better off spending the money on backup drives or services that minimize downtime and protect precious data that you can't replace. Many people considering desktops in the $200-to-$500 range should also consider a refurbished machine. In certain circumstances, they can be excellent values. Large corporations lease fleets of desktops for a few years at a time, after which third parties refurbish them and provide them for resale on eBay and via retailers such as Best Buy, Newegg, and TigerDirect. To find these systems, search or filter the product category pages for "off-lease" or refurbished systems. These refurbished PCs are often surprisingly cheap ($150 to $250 is common), and many are desktop towers, so they're easy to upgrade or service if a component goes south. They do come with drawbacks. Their components are usually several years behind the cutting edge, they may be in imperfect cosmetic condition (some refurbishers grade condition on an A-B-C scale), and different refurbishers can have varying levels of attention to detail. Still, refurbs can be a fine option if you're looking for a cheap desktop to stow in a cabinet or under a desk, used to check your email and calendar. Just be sure to buy from a seller with a reasonable return policy in case you get a dud. Armed with all of the knowledge and decision points above, you're almost ready to shop. The final consideration is how well a desktop PC performs. We review dozens of PCs every year, evaluating their features and testing their performance against peers in their respective categories. That way, you'll know which are best suited for gaming, which is our favorite general-purpose all-in-one, and which is the best if all you need is a small, powerful system you can get up and running quickly.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed as PPI data eases inflation concerns

Wednesday, 15 Jan 2025 NEW YORK, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, after the lower-than-expected U.S. producer price index (PPI) data offered temporary relief to investors concerned about persistent inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 221.16 points, or 0.52 percent, to 42,518.28. The S&P 500 added 6.69 points, or 0.11 percent, to 5,842.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 43.71 points, or 0.23 percent, to 19,044.39. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with utilities and financials leading the gainers by adding 1.30 percent and 1.28 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, communication services and health led the laggards by dropping 0.97 percent and 0.94 percent, respectively. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' PPI for December 2024 showed a 3.3 percent year-over-year increase, up from November's 3.0 percent but below economists' projections of 3.5 percent. On a monthly basis, PPI rose 0.2 percent, coming in under the forecasted 0.4 percent gain. The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.5 percent year over year, edging up from November's 3.4 percent but below expectations of a 3.8 percent increase. Month over month, core prices were flat, a marked slowdown from the anticipated 0.3 percent rise and November's 0.2 percent gain. Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan noted the release "seems encouraging" but it also "masks some price jumps in a few of the key components which feed directly into the Fed's preferred core PCE inflation gauge." Notably, domestic and international airfare prices -- which feed into the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index -- jumped in December. Major technology stocks continued their decline on Tuesday, with Nvidia losing 1.1 percent and Apple falling 0.5 percent. Both companies have had a sluggish start to 2025 after the significant gains in 2024. On the bond market front, the U.S. Treasury yields initially dropped following the PPI report. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Tuesday settled at 4.793 percent, up 0.6 basis points. Still, markets remain cautious as they await further confirmation from the consumer price index (CPI) report for December 2024, set for release Wednesday morning. Attention is also turning to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and BlackRock scheduled to release their results on Wednesday.

Title: Accounting rule changes have turned Bitcoin from risky venture to corporate must-have – Bitwise

According to Matt Hougan, the demand from this companies could impact the Bitcoin market in a positive and significant way. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan believes that companies adding Bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets are no longer an anomaly but a burgeoning megatrend that could transform the crypto market this year. In a recent memo to clients, Hougan highlighted that MicroStrategy has been making the headlines with its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy. The company has acquired approximately 257,000 BTC, more than all the Bitcoin mined last year, and plans to raise an additional $42 billion to continue its purchases. Hougan noted that the trend goes far beyond MicroStrategy. As of Jan. 14, 70 publicly traded companies, including household names like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre, hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies hold 141,302 BTC combined, while private firms such as SpaceX and Block.one have disclosed at least 368 BTC in holdings. According to Hougan, the game-changer is the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) introduction of ASU 2023-08. This rule allows publicly traded companies to mark Bitcoin holdings to market value, enabling them to record profits when Bitcoin’s price rises. Previously, Bitcoin was treated as an “intangible asset,” forcing companies to write down its value if the price fell but not allowing them to recognize gains when it increased. With reputational risks declining and the accounting landscape more favorable, Hougan predicts an explosion in the number of companies buying Bitcoin. He estimates that the current count of 70 could grow to hundreds, even thousands, in the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, Hougan argues that companies buy Bitcoin for the same reasons individuals do. Some see it as a hedge against dollar depreciation, others as a speculative asset to boost stock prices, and others as a signal of innovation to attract customers and talent. While motivations vary, he believes the influx of corporate demand has the potential to drive Bitcoin prices significantly higher, particularly as major players like Meta and others contemplate entry. Hougan concludes the document by saying that retail investors don’t need to understand why every company is buying Bitcoin. Instead, they should ask themselves where this demand is heading and what it means for the market.

Title: The Great Retreat: A Eulogy for the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/14/the-great-retreat-a-eulogy-for-the-net-zero-asset-managers-initiative/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T22:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Ladies and gentlemen, gather round for a moment of silence—or perhaps a loud guffaw—for the untimely suspension of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. Once the darling of “woke capitalism” and self-proclaimed savior of the planet, this alliance of investment giants has decided to fold its tent, apparently under the weight of its own contradictions and a little nudge from reality. An alliance of investment giants-turned-self-styled climate change crusaders looks to be in tatters after it suspended its activities on Monday amid a backlash against “woke” capitalism. The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative was rocked last week by the exit of BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, as The Post exclusively reported. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/climate-group-net-zero-asset-managers-suspends-activities-days-after-blackrock-quits/ar-BB1ro5bQ?ocid=msedgntp&pc=U531&cvid=bf7c5905139e48f18d996522bfb69b44&ei=10 NZAM was touted as a coalition of climate-conscious asset managers promising to steer trillions of dollars into sustainable investments. It had all the buzzwords: net zero, decarbonization, stakeholder capitalism. But as we now see, when rhetoric meets resistance, even the mightiest of “green” alliances can crumble. Larry Fink’s BlackRock, managing a modest $11.5 trillion, was the largest player in NZAM. But last week, BlackRock bolted, citing “confusion” over the initiative’s goals and the growing heat from legal and political scrutiny​. Confusion? For a group that allegedly led the charge on climate finance, confusion is an odd defense. But let’s not kid ourselves. The real story here isn’t confusion; it’s the political backlash. Republican lawmakers had been turning up the heat, questioning NZAM’s anti-fossil fuel stance and labeling it as a threat to free-market principles. For a firm like BlackRock, whose fiduciary duty is to maximize returns, the last thing it needed was to be dragged into a legal and political firestorm​. This retreat is about more than one firm’s exit. NZAM’s decision to suspend activities is a tacit admission that its grand vision of global decarbonization through financial engineering was built on a house of cards. It turns out that arm-twisting investors into abandoning fossil fuels—still the lifeblood of modern economies—isn’t as easy as issuing a press release. What NZAM and its allies failed to grasp is that most of the world isn’t ready to trade reliable energy sources for expensive “green” dreams. They didn’t count on a backlash from those who actually like to keep the lights on without bankrupting their economies. This debacle also lays bare the hollowness of so-called woke capitalism. For all the chest-beating about saving the planet, NZAM and its members were quick to run for the exits when the going got tough. They’ve proven that their commitment to climate goals was conditional, a mere marketing gimmick rather than a principled stand. This is a classic case of virtue signaling gone awry. Companies like BlackRock were happy to bask in the glow of green virtue as long as it was profitable—or, at least, painless. But when real-world pressures mounted, from legal inquiries to political challenges, those lofty ideals were quickly jettisoned. NZAM’s suspension underscores the dangers of pushing aggressive, top-down policies without a clear understanding of economic realities or public sentiment. The truth is, the world runs on fossil fuels, and no amount of corporate virtue signaling can change that overnight. Initiatives like NZAM ignore the complexities of global energy needs and the fact that renewables, aren’t ready to replace hydrocarbons on a large scale. Even more damning is how NZAM’s failure exposes the elitist arrogance of the climate crusade. These financial titans thought they could dictate policy from their boardrooms, ignoring the voices of everyday citizens and lawmakers. That hubris has now come back to bite them. The suspension of NZAM is more than just a setback for one initiative—it’s a symbolic defeat for the entire ideology of climate authoritarianism. It’s a reminder that policies based on coercion and moral grandstanding are bound to fail when confronted with economic and political realities. So, let us raise a toast to NZAM, not in mourning but in mockery. Its collapse is a victory for common sense and a warning to all who would attempt to impose utopian visions on a world that isn’t interested. May its demise serve as a lesson to the climate cartel: the road to net zero is paved with good intentions—and bankrupt ideologies. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Now it’s our turn. And the only winners are the lawyers No actually it isn’t. What’s being practiced by the Climate Fascists IS “lawfare.” Getting sued for violating one’s fiduciary duty is a LEGITIMATE CAUSE OF ACTION, it is *NOT* “lawfare.” The Climate Fascists have no legitimate cause of action, their litigation represents nothing more than their attempts to force their agenda by misuse of the courts because they can’t get it legislated into law politically.

Or as my dad was found of saying, “Bless their pointed little heads.” Article tip – Climate Jeezus Taketh Away – by James Howard Kunstler The author is a hyperbolic headline click bait crackpot An honest article title would have been: Several Large Financial Firms, Out of 700, Withdraw from Voluntary Net Zero Financial Coalition Out of 700, Withdraw from Voluntary Net Zero Financial Coalition Nope – the headline hits the target. There are 3 USA banks left in the UN NZ alliance: per this list: Amalgamated Bank Areti Bank Climate First Bank https://www.unepfi.org/members/ And anyone in the USA should avoid these remaining woke banks. Your number of 700 surpasses the 538 listed in all counties, all industries in all finance initiatives. 700 is correct for GFANZ, the parent organization for NZAM. There are GFANZ member firms in 50 nations. Major US banks and corporations are increasingly cautious about antagonizing the incoming administration and are withdrawing from climate-focused initiatives. If you read the bank press releases, as I have and you have not, they sound very woke and suggest the banks will continue their alternate anergy lending after they leave the GFANZ coalition. This article is about asset managers in NZAM. There is no indication they have changed their strategies about investing in alternative energy stocks and bonds. RG, dunno where you are coming from but it is nowhere I would want to be. Fact. There are exactly three maJor global asset managers. Two have now left. You count the other about 700 midgets as important, you have already lost. Pathetic. Only one left matters. the only interesting remaining question is what will State Street do? They are based in Boston, so is a big blue state question. I bet you they also fold very soon. You apparently love the article’s Eulogy conclusion so much that you do not care that there is ZERO evidence that any financial firms have changed their policies on alternative energy lending and investments. Their recent actions seem like virtue signaling for Trump. They still say they support Net Zero or the Energy transition. I want logical conclusions backed by data. You prefer conservative wishful thinking These withdrawals are the result of unjustified political pressure by Republicans BlackRock Exits Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus – Asian Wealth Management and Asian Private Banking NZAM has recently suspende activities bur GFANZ has not. It remains to be seen if NZAM will disband. GFANZ and NZAM seemed like leftist public relations non-profit NGOs. They did not do anything else I can find. Corrections This article was about NZAM with over 325 members as of July 2024 NZAM (Net Zero Asset Managers initiative) is directly related to GFANZ (Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero) as NZAM is one of the several alliances under the GFANZ umbrella, meaning it is a part of a larger group focused on achieving net-zero emissions across the financial sector, with NZAM specifically focusing on asset managers committed to net-zero goals; I had just read another article about the GFANZ. a Net Zero alliance. As of 2024, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) had over 700 members. GFANZ is a coalition of financial institutions that work together to help the world transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. The Global Net Zero Financial Cartel, Falling Apart — Manhattan Contrarian There are no data to know whether being in these voluntary organizations really affected financial decisions concerning alternative energy, or getting out of them changed those policies. “A Eulogy” in the article title is speculation unsupported by any data (aka BS). “ GFANZ is a coalition of financial institutions that work together to help the world transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. ” Well, as THAT will never be achieved, folks should have nothing to do with placing any money there.

The tragedy of the LA fires is a reflection of damage caused by false Climate Change practices. Actually, is it is a clear example of what happens when money that should be devoted to maintaining a safe and secure society, is squandered in pursuit of false goals/ideals based of flawed understanding of reality. The usual candidates are already stepping forward to present themselves as ‘experts’ claiming the LA tragedy of political incompetence, owes its origin to the human impact on climate conditions. Those experts could not be more wrong. Thank you Mr Mann.

There, we will be raising our glasses to the news, financial investment businesses have turned the page on ESG and are increasingly recognising their Net Zero folly. The worry for all of us is, how did these mega companies, responsible for guarding and investing our pensions and other investments fall for the Greta based nonsense in the first place? Its Davos next week, there the World’s movers and shakers have got to finally break away from this Climate Crisis nonsense. It is well past time to start back towards sustainable wealth creation rather than wealth destruction. The LA fires are a clear example of the damage caused when those in the highest public office fail to do the job they are in place to do. Those officials that spend their time on virtue signalling, (Gavin) rubbing along with their Hollywood heroes can now walk a mile in their hero’s shoes and smell the acrid smoke of their achievements. With luck, tomorrow they might wake up and smell the coffee. “It’s Davos next week…” It’d be nice if someone posted videos of the talks at Davos, also a list of the attendees.

Title: Microsoft lays off employees in security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming — separate from performance cuts

Microsoft is laying off employees across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, according to two people familiar with the matter. A Microsoft spokesperson said the layoffs were small but didn't specify a figure. They also said the layoffs were unrelated to the job cuts Business Insider recently reported, which were targeting underperforming employees across the company. One of the people familiar with the matter said employees started receiving notifications on Tuesday about layoffs in Microsoft's security unit. The group is run by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon, who stunned the industry when he left for Microsoft in 2021 to lead a revamped cybersecurity effort. Microsoft expanded its Secure Future Initiative last year, making security the top priority for every employee. The change followed years of security issues at Microsoft, including what the Department of Homeland Security called "a cascade of security failures" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers. The company also made security a core priority on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews. "If you're faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an email to Microsoft employees last year.

Title: Is UnitedHealth (UNH) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Safe Dividend Stocks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best safe dividend stocks for 2025. The year 2024 was exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market climbing over 23% and the tech-focused NASDAQ gaining 29%. These impressive results were driven by the “Magnificent 7” group of stocks, which rose nearly 67%, alongside several other large-cap stocks. It marked the second consecutive year of over 20% gains for the broader market, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the market’s future, as 2024 demonstrated remarkable strength, suggesting the positive trend could continue. However, despite the current upbeat outlook, investor sentiment could shift quickly due to factors such as global tensions, economic developments, or unforeseen events. No matter how the market trends, investors tend to gravitate towards safe stocks that offer stability, particularly during challenging times. Among these secure investment choices, dividend stocks are especially favored. These stocks are typically issued by companies with a reliable history of consistent dividend payments, often from well-established sectors such as utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare. READ ALSO: 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now Historical analysis consistently shows that dividend stocks tend to outperform other asset classes across various market cycles. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns for US stocks. From 1980 to 2019, a period marked by a significant decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the returns from the broader market. The report further mentioned that dividends become especially valuable in a low-interest-rate environment, offering a steady cash flow when other fixed-income options are less attractive. Once companies start paying dividends, they rarely stop, and most increase their payouts over time. Paying dividends can make a stock more appealing to investors, potentially boosting its value. Over the last decade, dividends for the benchmark index have grown annually, with an average compound growth rate of just over 7%. In strong markets, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in years with low or negative returns, such as 2020 and 2022, dividends played a larger role in total returns, helping to bolster portfolio resilience. Regarding the safety of dividend stocks, analysts recommend that investors prioritize dividend growth rather than chasing yield traps. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar’s Index team, stressed the importance of focusing on dividend growth, highlighting that it is a distinct strategy from high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth reflects a company’s strong competitive position and positive future prospects. A dividend growth portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector distribution and growth versus value characteristics, such as price-to-earnings ratios. While it has a value-oriented approach, it is more balanced and core-focused compared to a high-dividend portfolio. Companies with a history of consistently raising their dividends have typically outperformed those that don’t pay dividends, all while experiencing less volatility. While dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate, especially in the current environment, they have played a substantial role in enhancing overall equity returns over the years. For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 60%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112 5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 33.15% UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a Minnesota-based health insurance company. It boasts a solid dividend track record. It began distributing annual dividends in 1990 and transitioned to quarterly payments in 2010. Since that shift, the company has consistently increased its dividend each year, earning it a spot as one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $2.10 per share for a dividend yield of 1.55%, as of January 13. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) has surged by over 4% in the past 12 months. In the third quarter of 2024, the company delivered strong earnings, with revenue reaching $100.8 billion, a 9.16% increase compared to the same period last year. Its domestic commercial services saw significant growth, gaining 2.4 million new customers this year. For the full year 2024, net earnings are projected to be between $15.50 and $15.75 per share, taking into account the sale of its South American operations earlier in the year and the impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. PGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund highlighted UNH in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is the largest health care services company in the U.S. The company offers healthcare benefits to Americans who receive insurance from employers or government-based programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Half of the company is represented from non-benefits businesses under the Optum umbrella. This includes a technology business that helps hospitals, pharma companies, and other payors. It also includes a fast-growing provider business where Optum owns surgery centers and urgent care centers. The company’s primary care business continues to grow and it’s participating in the emerging trend of primary care taking on risk and acting like an insurance company. Finally, UnitedHealth owns a drug benefits manager. The company continues to have high quality and well-positioned businesses. In the first half of ’24, UnitedHealth has beat earnings expectations and confirmed full year financial guidance. While medical costs have pressured results, the company has cut a lot of spending to support earnings. We have also seen volatility in the stock related to political dynamics; a view that Republicans are better for this group helped support the stock in June and July and a moderation in policy views from the democratic nominee also helped support the stock. Future catalysts for the company and the stock include potentially stabilizing cost trend, a calmer political environment, and visibility into the company’s long-term earnings growth targets.” According to Insider Monkey’s database of Q3 2024, 112 hedge funds owned stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared with 114 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are valued at over $15 billion in total. Overall, UNH ranks 3rd on our list of best safe dividend stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Best Wireless Earbuds, Tested For Months By Our Tech Editor
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/the-best-wireless-earbuds/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T21:03:30Z

As the tech editor at Forbes Vetted, wireless earbuds need to tick a few boxes to earn my recommendation: They need to have great sound, stellar noise cancellation, a long battery life and intuitive controls. And since they always come with a carrying case, they should be portable and easy to locate if you happen to lose them around your home or office. The catch? After testing 19 pairs over several months, I found that there’s no one-size-fits-all best wireless earbud for everyone (more on that below). My personal top pick is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds, which combine incredible audio quality and noise cancellation—by far the best of all the pairs I tested. But, they’re not going to be everyone’s favorite for a couple of reasons. abc The Bose are pricey, and in addition to the almost-$300 cost, you have to pay an extra $49 if you want a wireless charging case. Further, the battery drains after just a few hours. So if you’re not keen on spending hundreds on a pair of earbuds or you value battery life as a top priority, there are plenty of other worthy options. My top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, can get you pretty great sound for less than $80. Others, like the premium Denon PerL Pros, use AI to enhance audio based on your ear shape. Based on rigorous testing with 19 sets over several months, here are my picks for the best wireless earbuds for 2025. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 6 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 8.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The noise canceling of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is unparalleled. During my testing, there were multiple times that I didn’t hear my husband approach until he tapped my shoulder. Subway rides also were also muted and I could enjoy reading my Kindle Paperwhite in near silence, quite a feat considering how screechy New York City public transit can be. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds feature an oval-shaped eartip for ergonomic comfort. While the equalizer adjustment controls aren’t too detailed (you can change the earbuds’ frequencies for bass, mids and trebles for up to six levels in either direction), they get the job done, and it’s not fully necessary to adjust them at all. I found myself only tweaking them a bit to enhance the bass, since the audio quality is so good out of the box. And if you find yourself swapping between your laptop and phone regularly, they support multipoint connectivity. All said, there are a couple drawbacks that left me less than enthused. For one, the battery life is relatively short; I wore them on a transcontinental flight and used them in the airport, thinking I would get a full six hours with ANC on—but I heard the dreaded low battery notification mid-flight. It’s not the end of the world—a quick 15-minute charge gets you another two hours in a pinch—but it’s a big enough drawback that if you want long-lasting earbuds, look elsewhere. Secondly, the case is a bulky beast that does not offer wireless charging, and you need to pay an additional $49 for a wireless charging case. I personally find this insulting, considering the already-costly $299 sticker price. Ultimately, I chose Bose’s QuietComfort Ultras as my top choice based solely on sound quality, and yes, it’s that good. Finally to clarify, the brand has wireless headphones with the same name, so keep this in mind when shopping to avoid confusion. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 44 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IP55 | Drivers: 10.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The OnePlus Buds 3 feel like a dark horse winner as my best budget pick, but after extensive testing, they’re truly the best if you’re mindful of your spending. The earbuds come with touch controls, which is mostly fine, though during testing I learned the hard way not to apply a lot of pressure. If you do, the earbuds shift in your ear canal. They won’t fall out–they were quite secure in my ear–but it can be annoying. A simple tap or gentle long press is all you need to control them. If you’re not an iPhone or OnePlus phone user, then the app may also give you pause. The Hey Melody app for Android users doesn’t get as deep into the frequency weeds as other earbud apps, like the Denon PerL Pros. Still, it does a solid job of delivering the basics, including four listening profiles and the ability to create a custom profile via five different frequency settings. The OnePlus Buds 3 have a sleek design that fit snugly and comfortably in my ears. Looking past the app, though, the price/value ratio on these earbuds wowed me. The audio felt detailed and rich, especially once I turned on OnePlus 3D Audio (the brand’s version of spatial audio). I also completed a sound test profile to help finesse my listening experience, which enhanced some areas that I felt were lacking. They simply have no right to sound as good as they do, with some of the details in the mids layering nicely compared with other competitors in this price range. Could the audio be better? Absolutely—the bass in particular could be stronger. But at that point, you’re looking at spending three figures on the Bose or the Denons to get that high-quality deep bass. These earbuds cost around $70, and for the price, you get pretty darn good audio. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 26 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP57 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro wireless earbuds don’t offer the single best audio quality, and the ANC isn’t the absolute best on the market. But when I’m heading into the subway, or when I’m about to hop on a plane, they’re the pair I always take with me. I’ve had them since July’s Samsung Unpacked, and after testing them for several months with my Android device, they’re my top pick for the category because they represent the best combination of ANC, audio quality and more for Android users. Yes, they mimic the Apple AirPods’ design—that’s something the company caught flack for at the initial launch. But that design wears comfortably in my ears and I can keep them in for long hours without my ears feeling itchy, a problem I experience with most wireless earbuds. The Samsung Buds 3 Pros look similar in design to the Apple AirPods, but they're built for Android ... [+] users. Go to the app to adjust your ANC levels. There you’ll also find a few audio presets, including balanced, dynamic and bass boost. Personally, I found dynamic to be the most effective, but your mileage and preferences may vary. Other useful features include 360 audio which aims to place you in the middle of the action, and you can also turn on head-tracking if that suits you. Songs like Florence and the Machine’s “King” and “Cosmic Love” sounded rich and detailed. I typically test audio for the balance of the harp in the latter against the rest of the instrumentals. While further into the song, the harp was hard to distinguish, it’s still good enough for most needs. With many earbuds offering touch controls, the physical buttons feel like a boon in a sea of accidental touches, something that I’ve had happen more times thanks to my bushy hair. I’ve also felt the advertised battery life—around 7 hours—is good. Because they pair best with Samsung phones and I use the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, I can open the settings and see the battery life at a glance from the Bluetooth display. But that leads to another caveat: Android versus iOS. If you have an Android phone, particularly a Samsung device, these earbuds integrate just fine. If you have iOS, though, you may have a problem, as Apple users don’t have access some of the Wear app integrations—and to an extent, this affects Google Pixel users, too. But if you have an Android phone—and ideally a Samsung—these are the earbuds to get. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 20 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP54 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: While the AirPods Pro 2 provide high fidelity audio and the new Hearing Aid features, if you don’t want all the extras, the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC (active noise cancellation) should be at the top of your list. They feature Apple’s signature sleek design, but what you don’t get is the silicone ear tips (which tend to deliver a more secure fit). If you’re not a jogger or if you’re not worried about an adjustable fit, this won’t matter much since I found they stayed firmly in my ears during my testing, despite my initial fear that they would fall out. One of my biggest surprises during testing was just how good the audio quality is despite the modest price tag. Could they sound better? Probably. But I pitted them against two earbuds—the Denon PerL Pros and the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8s—and I struggled to hear any audio quality differences among the three. That speaks pretty well about the audio fidelity that these affordable AirPods can output. It wasn’t until I tested this pair on Florence and The Machine’s “Cosmic Love” that I spotted some subtle differences in the mids and basses. Even then, if you’re not actively listening for audio details, you’re probably not going to notice. You won't find silicone ear tips on the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC. The ANC on them is also surprisingly good, but again, you’re not getting those silicone ear tips so don’t expect the best ANC that Apple has to offer. Apple’s ANC has a mode called Conversation Awareness that automatically adjusts so you can hear what’s going on around you when it detects that you’re talking to someone. It was great when I worked at home and wanted to tune out the schoolchildren in my neighborhood. But there were moments when I was listening to music and it registered my husband speaking with his parents in the same room and randomly subdued my audio when it registered that as a conversation. As for its battery life, it’s on par with Apple’s claim of four hours with ANC on, based on my testing. It’s not the best by far, but if you’re a casual listener, odds are you won’t be using them for more than four hours at a time, anyway. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 40 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 10mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: I’ve tested countless earbuds, but it’s not every day that I find a pair whose sound sets a new bar for audio quality. That’s exactly what happened when I tried the Denon PerL Pro wireless earbuds. Yes, they look like giant discs and feel a little unwieldy in my ears. But in my estimation, the audio quality is comparable products in the $300 price range. The Denon PerL Pros have a unique build. Interestingly, Denon refers to the earbuds’ ANC as the Immersion mode, and the earbuds “scan” your ears to customize the way it interacts with your ears. It sounds cool, and if you don’t want more control over your personalization, you can, but I don’t recommend it—the scan works just fine, and it’s designed for audiophiles that want to tinker with every single frequency. Once I’d completed the scan and switched to this mode, my audio was something of a mixed bag. Ashnikko’s songs sounded bass-heavy, while Florence and the Machine’s catalogue sounded incredible. I could hear every layer with clarity, even with the bass feeling overpowered during “Dog Days Are Over.” I also cross-tested with two other Florence songs, “King” and “Cosmic Love,” and found that for once I could clearly hear the bass on the former and every pluck of the harp on the latter. It was simply delightful. Remember when I mentioned they look unwieldy in my ears? They dwarf my ears when worn. However, there are some minor caveats to consider before splurging on these. They look like giant discs stuffed into your ears, and for those who thrive on subtlety and sleekness, that may be off-putting. The other issue is the “Immersion” ANC mode: You can’t control it. I’ve found in my travels that the ANC could be improved, as it’s not the strongest compared to the Bose QuietComfort Ultras or even the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

Battery life: 10 hours (without ANC); 40 hours with case | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: When the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds launched, I took them on two flights to test them for my full-length review. Even after returning home, I found myself skipping my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset in favor of these earbuds. SteelSeries nailed the comfort level right off the bat, offering three ear tips sizes to suit most needs, and the design fits snugly in my ear. Another key feature I appreciate is the physical button controls. It may sound surprising considering the industry shift to touch controls, but it’s a huge factor on why I keep coming back to these as my main gaming headset. With them, there are no accidental touches if you brush your hair behind your ear during gaming. SteelSeries products, including the Arctis GameBuds, offer a special EQ software called Sonar. Typically installed on a PC, in this case, it’s in the form of an app. This creates a caveat for gamers, though: no multipoint connectivity. Still, I appreciate that I can use either Bluetooth or 2.4GHz (with a dongle) to connect to my devices, including my beloved Nintendo Switch. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds feature physical buttons. The Arctis’ audio for music is quite good, but its real claim to fame is its gaming audio. You get spatial audio for gaming in a compact, portable package. It’s good enough that when battling in Far Cry 6, I can still hear movements clearly on one earbud versus the other. I can also hear the direction enemies move from—that’s very important as a gamer, and props to SteelSeries for factoring it into this compact package. As earbuds, this pick doesn’t quite rival the best gaming headsets if you want a truly immersive experience. Also, the battery life is underwhelming at 10 hours, as opposed to gaming headsets that can pack in 20 hours—and as much as 300 hours—of use before needing a recharge. But in the realm of wireless earbuds, 10 hours is impressive, especially since most of the picks on my list can only go up to six or eight hours before requiring a recharge. All in all, given their price and the audio quality, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are an incredible product that I find myself using almost daily. A quick note: If you plan on using these with your PlayStation, you’ll want the PlayStation model. It’s an important distinction to help get the most out of the gaming features available on these earbuds.

Battery life: Up to 7.5 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm (unconfirmed) | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: The Bose Ultra Open earbuds combine two features that are essential to runners: A comfortable, nonslip fit for hours of comfortable wear, and an open audio environment that lets you hear the world around you through your music. The earbuds clip onto your ear helix (you know, the outer, curved part of your ear) so you can wear them for hours in comfort. While I didn’t personally test this pair, they were (and continue to be) a top contender chosen by Forbes executive editor Dave Johnson, who has extensive experience testing, writing and editing in the tech world. “They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and they stay doggedly affixed to my ear no matter what I’m doing,” he says, adding that he uses them regularly in his workout routines. “Traditional earbuds, like the Apple AirPods Pro, tend to work themselves loose when I’m working out at the gym and I always need to fiddle with them to keep them from falling out while jogging on the treadmill. That’s no longer a problem with the Ultra Open.” That said, the audio is where the Opens begin to lose some of their appeal, and for audiophiles, you’ll want to decide whether it’s worth that ever-so-slight downgrade. During testing, the earbuds held up really well against the competition. “The sound is rich and full, with excellent spatial audio, and I can still feel the bass even though a lot of it is just radiated away into the air around my ears,” shares Johnson. But, it’s important to note that the bass doesn’t quite hit the same as compared with other earbuds, especially when compared to its sibling, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras. The battery life is also surprisingly stellar for a first-gen design, which wowed our testers. “I think Bose expects you to just leave these things clipped to your ears all day long, and the respectable battery life lets you do that,” says Johnson. He regularly enjoys more than 7 hours of continuous runtime with spatial audio off (it dropped to around 4.5 hours with spatial audio on). And, if you’re running low on battery, the accompanying case gets him an additional two full charges, too. Be sure to take a look at the new chilled lilac color, a Bose website exclusive; if I had to relive my life, I would have sprung for those pastel hues. Soundcore Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 8 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: This year at CES—an annual, world-renown tech exhibition—an Anker PR rep handed me this pair of Soundcore AeroClips, telling me they had just launched and to take them for a spin. An offshoot to Anker, Soundcore is a budget-friendly line that promises to deliver big sound for less. I tossed them on my ears and essentially wore them nonstop for a few days, wearing out the eight-hour battery life to get a sense of how they performed. The Soundcore AeroClips are comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their ... [+] bulk. I was tickled pink by how delightful I found these open ear wireless earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their bulk, which was surprising; unlike the Bose Ultra Opens, which are my “best open ear” pick, the AeroClips “clip” onto your ear helix (although, I also felt they rested on my ears a bit). I did note that sometimes I needed to adjust them with my glasses on, but that wasn’t the end of the world. Bose still takes the cake in comfort, but I didn’t mind wearing these for many hours. I was also very pleasantly surprised with the audio on these, but there’s a caveat: Soundcore offers a Soundcore Signature preset that I find abysmal at best. As a classically trained musician, I believe music should be balanced and clear so you feel like you’re smack dab in the action; too much bass, and it gets muddy, whereas an emphasis on treble frequencies can leave your audio sounding tinny. The Signature preset across a few Soundcore models varies greatly, and on the AeroClips, there was virtually no balance whatsoever. But, not all is lost here. I found the cinematic sound I sought with the Classical preset, which is the one I would recommend using. if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget, this pair is hard to beat. Ultimately, open ear wireless earbuds at this price shouldn’t sound this good, but Soundcore pulled it off—and kudos to them, because I’m impressed. Soundcore put a lot of thought and consideration into the AeroClips, and it shows in these earbuds. You’ll have to wait a bit to get them as they begin shipping January 22, but if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget—specifically if you want buds to use while running in the park , letting you listen to audio while also hearing outside noises—this pair is hard to beat. While my top picks represent some of the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, many others didn’t quite make the cut. Below are 11 more models I tested, plus reasons why they didn’t earn a spot on this list. Anker Soundcore C40i ($90 at Amazon): I wanted to love the Soundcore C40i wireless earbuds, and if budget is your priority for open ear wireless earbuds, these are the pick for you. But I found the audio quality to be lacking. It’s good enough for runs and general gym activities, but if you spend an extra $30 for the AeroClips (which made it on this list), your ears will thank you. OnePlus Buds 3 Pro ($99 at Amazon): The OnePlus Buds 3 Pros are pretty darn good, but they don’t fit into any specific category. Like my top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, they use the Melody app if you’re not a OnePlus or iPhone user, but it’s still a worthwhile pick. That said, if you’re a OnePlus user, it’s worth the upgrade to the Buds 3 Pro over the Buds 3. Audio-Technica ATH-CKS50TW2 ($149 at Amazon): The ATH-CKS50TW2 earbuds excel at one thing: battery life. They can last up to 15 hours with ANC on, 25 without, and you get an extra 40 hours with the charging case. The audio, however, felt a little too muddy for my taste despite fiddling with the EQ. It’s still pretty darn good though, and most users will be happy with this pair. It’s also hard to argue with another huge boon to their build: physical buttons, which are quickly becoming a relic in earbud designs—I personally love this choice. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 ($320 at Amazon): I wanted to love these earbuds—they were on par with the Denon PerL Pros during my testing. However, both managing editor Emmy Favilla and I both had connectivity issues with two separate review units during our testing. For the price—the highest of any I tested at $399—that’s unacceptable. If you can stomach that, you may have to put them back in the case once or twice before they work in your ears, then they’re a good choice. Sony LinkBuds ($178 at Amazon): These were also a near miss. They feature a new, innovative design with ear tips shaped like a comma. However, I found them uncomfortable in my ears even after adjusting and swapping ear tips multiple times. Despite deep testing the audio features, I found the audio quality lacking, and I had concerns over the case’s longevity; it felt cheaply built. Simply put, while they’d be great for teens, as an audiophile, I wasn’t a fan. JLab GoPop ANC ($30 at Walmart): I loved these earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long periods, and the charging case is tiny and features a built-in charging cable. My problem? At the loudest, they’re not very loud in my ears, and many of the songs I listened to lacked bass even with the bass boost turn on. Still, for the price, these would be a great choice for teens who want decent audio without a sky-high price tag. JLab JBuds Mini ($40 at Amazon): For their tiny size, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the power behind the JLab JBuds Mini Wireless Earbuds. That said, I found that I needed the largest size for one of my ears, otherwise the earbud felt too loose; your mileage may vary, and they may not fit if you have larger ears. They also don’t come with ANC—only passive noise cancellation. I still had to turn the earbuds down to hear my husband during walks in the local park, so while not the strongest, it does reduce some sound. One thing to note: During testing, I noted that on windy days, the Bluetooth connectivity frequently cut out, which is why they didn’t make my best budget pick. Baseus M2 (out of stock): The Baseus M2s are really comfortable in the ears and for the price, the ANC is surprisingly very effective. I found myself tossing these in my ears fairly often at my desk to tune out the school next door to my house over others due to how effective it was. However, the audio for music doesn’t quite match up to its competitors. It’s great for podcasts and audiobooks, though, and its price is very attractive. Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro ($199 at Amazon): During testing, Favilla noted the Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro felt comfortable to wear over long periods of time, and taking calls felt seamless. The sound quality is on par with the previous generation, and they paired almost instantly with a Google Pixel 7 Pro. Google did a stellar job upgrading its ANC from the previous generation, too. Marshall Motif II ANC ($150 at Amazon): The Motif II ANC earbuds sound pretty great, and packs punchy basses and high trebles for an enjoyable listening experience. But upon further testing, the noise canceling and construction could be improved. Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 ($200 at Best Buy): The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds have some of the best ANC in the business, with a solid audio profile, to boot. They’re so good they nearly eliminate airplane engines in flight. Unfortunately, Jabra announced this generation is the last in its consumer line it will produce. More concerning, Jabra only guaranteed updates for two years. With most earbuds lasting much longer than that, I can’t fully recommend a short-lived product. To find the best wireless earbuds on the market, I put over a dozen pairs to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Sony and more. From there, I put my shortlist to the test. The best wireless earbuds should feel sturdily built, with a sleek design that feels comfortable in your ears. After all, if you’re wearing them for an extended period of time, you shouldn't feel any discomfort. I also evaluated the design based on wireless charging versus wired only, case bulk and more. No matter what genre you’re listening to, your audio quality should have a reasonable balance of base, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness amongst the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each pair of wireless earbuds across a variety of songs, and I considered whether ANC and spatial audio changed the overall sound quality. Some of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of wireless earbuds include: When you’re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested these earbuds for 30 minutes each, logging battery light percentage at the beginning and at the end. I also cross tested this with the ANC on versus off to get a sense of whether each pair lived up to its claims. I’ve been involved in tech journalism for over five years, including more than a year as the consumer tech and electronics editor at Forbes Vetted. In addition to working with home entertainment, such as testing the best gaming TVs and the best TVs for bright rooms, I have also tested most of the latest smart wearables currently on the market, from the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova GameBuds and more. In my time testing wireless earbuds, I focus on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual folks who want a no-frills set of earbuds for occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum. For this story, I focused on various features each pair of wireless earbuds offered as they applied to work, travel and more everyday scenarios. I evaluated a slew of features on each pair, including audio quality, software integrations, ANC and more. I also made sure to test each earbuds for a minimum of 10 hours to dive into the finer details each pair offered. I also carefully reviewed the software for each pair of wireless earbuds offered to determine which had the best balance of features and price. When I’m not testing the latest audio equipment, I’ve spent plenty of time testing the newest mobile devices. I’ve deep-dived into the Apple ecosystem with the iPhone 16 Pro and reviewed plenty of Android devices, including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Google Pixel 8. Most recently, I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro. I added two new recommendations: the Anker Soundcore AeroClip earbuds as the best budget open ear pick and the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds as the best gaming earbuds. I also added notes on three other contenders that didn’t quite make the cut.

Title: Departure of potential Fink successor creates new CEO drama at BlackRock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A potential successor to BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink is reportedly leaving, narrowing the list of contenders to become the next boss of the world's largest money manager. Mark Wiedman, who is a head of BlackRock’s global client business and member of the firm’s global executive committee, has chosen to pursue opportunities outside of the firm, according to a report from the Financial Times. For years, investors have been wondering when the 72-year-old Fink is going to step down. He co-founded the firm in 1988 and built it into a financial giant that manages $11 trillion. Wiedman was viewed as among the likely contenders to succeed Fink, along with chief operating officer Rob Goldstein, chief financial officer Martin Small, and BlackRock International head Rachel Lord. Another recent high-profile exit of a potential Fink successor was Salim Ramji, who is now the chief executive of BlackRock rival Vanguard Group. The FT report about Wiedman’s departure comes just ahead of BlackRock's release of fourth quarter 2024 earnings on Wednesday morning. BlackRock is not the only Wall Street giant that generated some new succession drama on Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) on Tuesday elevated Jennifer Piepszak to chief operating officer as part of a new management reshuffling, but the nation’s largest bank said that Piepszak doesn’t want to succeed Jamie Dimon as CEO. The shake-up adds new uncertainty to the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO and the only one left who called the shots during the 2008 financial crisis. Piepszak had previously been considered one of the frontrunners to get Dimon’s job eventually. At BlackRock, Wiedman oversaw the money manager’s efforts to assist governments and financial institutions with their troubled assets during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Wiedman also led BlackRock’s iShares ETF business as it grew from $500 billion to $1.7 trillion in assets under management. His exit comes as the money manager makes a deeper push into alternative assets with three recent acquisitions. In December it made a $12 billion bet on HPS Investment Partners, a firm run by three ex-employees of Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that specializes in lending money to riskier companies. Earlier in 2024 it agreed to buy London data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion and private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners for about $12.5 billion. The purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners, which closed in October, was a bet on growing demand for new energy, transportation, and digital infrastructure projects in the coming years. BlackRock is also trying to stay out of the hot seat in Washington as the GOP takes over the White House and all of Congress. At the end of last week, BlackRock pulled out of a UN-supported climate group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). It also was granted more time to resolve a standoff with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over its holdings of US banks, ensuring that the dispute will now play out in the opening months of Trump 2.0.

Title: BlackRock expected to post booming earnings — as Larry Fink’s firm shifts from woke investing of past

If you haven’t noticed, BlackRock — yes, that BlackRock — is going unwoke. It’s also going far from broke, On The Money has learned. Wednesday before the bell, the big-money management firm, the world largest in fact, will report both its fourth quarter earnings and those for the entire year. Both are likely to depict that its business is running at full tilt, my sources on Wall Street tell me. Confluence doesn’t necessarily equate concurrence, of course. But it’s remarkably obvious that at a time when BlackRock has dialed back its overt progressive posturing — leaving, as the Post reported last week, a UN-sponsored group of environmental activists — its financial performance is soaring, at least according to the Wall Street buzz. One major reason: The heat from conservative critics for its so-called ESG investing has waned as it stepped back from being a staunch advocate of the woke investing strategy. Red State treasurers still look at BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink with skepticism, but these days less so, and they’ve largely stopped castigating him as a woke monster. They have also largely stopped pulling money from the firm as he stopped going all in on woke. By focusing less on political issues and more on business, BlackRock is flourishing. Its assets under management are slated to spike to above $11.5 trillion even as recent higher interest rates will hurt its fixed income holdings. Its earnings, analysts say, should be strong despite the rise in rates because of its diversified business. At a time when big asset managers are facing pressure from customers over fees, etc,, and facing customer outflows, BlackRock last year received a ton of new money from a wide diversity of sources, such as pension funds and individuals, sources said. And BlackRock is killing it on crypto. Look at a list of top Bitcoin holders, and in a short period of time, BlackRock – -a symbol of so-called “trad fit” or traditional finance — is at the top, just behind the iconic Satoshi Nakamoto, and crypto exchange Binance. As of January, it holds around 560,000 bitcoins worth around $55 billion in the most popular digital coin because it offers the most popular Bitcoin ETF. The ETF inflows have been steady, as the earnings report will demonstrate, sources said. BlackRock declined to comment for this report because it cannot provide pre-earnings forward guidance, but my sources insist that it will be a hard-earned victory for Fink. Yes, I know, Fink says a lot of stuff — some of which has gotten him in trouble in his advocacy of Environmental Social Governance investing. The investment style, his critics alleged, channeled progressive politics on issues like energy conservation through the investment process. In recent years, he earned the ire of the both Red State GOP-run pension funds, and Republicans in Congress even as he won plaudits from the political left for using BlackRock’s investment might to enact social change. But with the growth of Red State populations and their pension funds, Fink’s ESG posturing was costly; assets declined around $1 trillion in 2022. I know Fink better than his critics, and the caricature of him being an Elizabeth Warren acolyte is simply false. Fink started BlackRock 30 years ago with zero assets and he didn’t build it to $11.5-plus trillion on left wing politics. He’s among the best risk managers on Wall Street, gleaned from years of experience trading bonds, and learning from his losses, as so many in his position haven’t, which is why at 72 he’s still kicking as CEO. I have reported that he went too far out on the limb of ESG because of the money. He was able to get plenty of left-wing pension business in New York and California. But as far back as 2021 he sensed a problem with it and was calling for a sustainability transition or there will be less oil drilling and inflation. He’s been moving away from ESG ever since, degrading its screens in managing non-ESG related assets. As I exclusively reported, he ditched a key UN-backed asset-management group last week dedicated to reducing carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Now here’s something interesting: In Red-State political circles, critics of Fink may still call him. “Mr ESG.” A newer younger generation of investors call him “Mr. Bitcoin” — despite him once calling the digital token an “index of money laundering.” He realized his mistake and launched the Bitcoin ETF almost exactly a year ago in January 2024. It’s up nearly 125% since. So when you wake up Wednesday, I hear BlackRock will be touting its strong results. Fink, I’m sure, will be taking a victory lap on financial TV. He should because there’s no coincidence that as he and the firm went unwoke, they moved about as far from broke as you can imagine. Advertisement

Title: Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg and biz leaders choose Trump inauguration over World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland

Billionaire business leaders who want bragging rights usually flock to the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland — but this year it’s being overshadowed by Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Swiss forum kicks off on the same day the 47th president will be sworn in, Jan. 20, and regulars including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi will all be in Washington, DC for Trump, according to insiders. Sources close to the new administration say it’s an indication political events — and President Trump’s actions — are far more significant to US businesses and leaders than anything in the Swiss Alps could be. “It’s unfortunate timing for Davos,” one source said of the event, which runs until Jan. 24. “If you’re a business leader, your time is better spent at the receptions meeting the people who will drive policy in the US, where you are talking about business and trade and ripple effects across the pond.” A well-placed venture capitalist helping craft Trump’s tech policy told NYNext that for the first time in years, “I don’t know anyone going to Davos.” Davos attracts important businesspeople, lawmakers, presidents and policy makers from around the globe to debate the largest problems humanity faces, but it is often labelled elitist, too woke and a place where there is much talk but little action. “Davos is an irrelevant, elitist money grab,” angel investor and co-host of the All-In podcast Jason Calacanis told NYNext. “Builders don’t waste time and money on virtual signaling nonsense like that.” CEOs are instead betting time with Trump, 78, at the inauguration will be better for business. Since Trump’s election last November, CEOs have been falling over themselves to win him over — some even after years of antagonizing the Republican leader. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have each donated $1 million to the Inaugural fund in an effort to show new support for Trump and to get themselves plugged into the new administration. So many people are eager to donate the incoming president has raised a record $170 million — almost triple the $62 million Joe Biden raised for his inaugural fund. Many of these companies, including Amazon and Uber, are also hosting parties around Jan. 20th in an effort to reach the rank-and-file staffers on Trump’s team as well. (Tech sources note the most important party for them is Peter Thiel’s party on Saturday night). The split in attendance underscores the larger trend of Silicon Valley embracing Donald Trump, while Wall Street has remained largely quiet. On Wall Street, which has remained a stronghold for Democrats, most bank executives are expected to stick to their usually scheduled programming and spend the entire week in Davos, with world leaders. “They need international friends because they don’t have friends in this government,” a regular at Davos, who is instead attending the Inauguration this year, joked of the Wall Street CEOs headed to Davos. Jamie Dimon — who had been secretly communicating with Trump about economic policy during the campaign and, at one point, was even floated as a possible Treasury Secretary — is headed straight to Davos, NYNext has learned. Other bank CEOs, like Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon, are expected to make a pit stop in DC over the weekend before arriving in Davos by the 20th, sources told NYNext. BlackRock, which has recently moved away from its emphasis on ESG over and even exited a climate initiative with the United Nation, is sending a senior delegation of top executives to the Inauguration led by BlackRock co-founder Rob Kapito, sources told The Post. CEO Larry Fink has yet to decide if he will attend. At least one world leader, Argentina’s President Javier Milei, is expected to attend the Inauguration then jet to Davos the next day – which is turning out to be a popular method. “People are trying to do both,” one Wall Street source explained. “But people can prioritize Inauguration weekend and still get to Davos.” While Davos remains focused on issues like climate and “amplifying perspectives from indigenous communities,” over the last year its programming has also shifted marginally towards the center of the political spectrum. Last year, The Post reported climate activist poster woman Greta Thunberg — a notable fixture at the conference in recent years — did not make an appearance at the event. Instead, panels focused more on technology and the impact of artificial intelligence. This story is part of NYNext, a new editorial series that highlights New York City innovation across industries, as well as the personalities leading the way. This year’s theme is “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,” working together to address global challenges. But despite its evolution, some sources are skeptical Davos will retain its prominence among the world’s moguls. The source close to Trump adds, “The election showed the Davos way of thinking about the world is dead… there is a return to populism on trade, immigration and economic and security policies.” Advertisement

This is a published version of Forbes’ Careers Newsletter. Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Workers in 21 states started the new year with an increase in hourly and salaried wages, thanks in part of inflation raises and successful ballot measures. Is it too late to wish everyone a happy new year? We’re back this week after taking a short holiday vacation and have a newsletter filled with the biggest work-related news to kick off the year. (And if you’re struggling to get back into the flow of work, senior contributor Jack Kelly has some great tips on how to ease back in.) The start of 2025 brings some good news for workers in many U.S. states: Minimum wages rose in 21 states and Washington, D.C. at the start of the year, giving 9.2 million workers $5.7 billion in additional earnings, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. This marks one of the largest-ever state minimum wage increases in recent U.S. history. But while the hikes are a result of successful ballot measures to raise state wage floors, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour and has not increased since 2009. Several other cities and municipalities—predominantly in California, Colorado and Washington—are raising their hourly minimums above state floors. Workers in Tukwila, Washington will have the highest minimum hourly wage this year at $21.10 an hour. Other cities, like New York, are raising their minimum overtime exemption pay for salaried employees. The new year also welcomes new pay transparency laws in five states: Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Vermont. In total, 14 states, Washington D.C. and several city or county jurisdictions require employers to publish salary ranges with job postings. Pay transparency requirements have gained popularity in recent years and have largely been pushed through by local jurisdictions. A federal bill on the matter was introduced to Congress in 2023.

Watch out for ghost jobs, a lack of feedback and intense competition as you start your job search. If one of your New Year’s resolutions was to read more, you may want to take inspiration from Philadelphia Eagles player A.J. Brown. The wide receiver was photographed reading a book called “Inner Excellence” on the sidelines of Sunday’s playoff game (which the team won). The book, written by Jim Murphy, has topped Amazon’s best seller’s list since Monday. I sat down with Murphy to speak about the new eyes in his book, what inner excellence is really about, and what everyone—from football players to desk workers—can take away from its message. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Jim, let’s start from the top. What is “inner excellence”? Well, it’s really about being clear about what you want most. It’s about asking yourself, “Why am I doing this? Why am I working? Like, what do I really want?” Because especially in America, there is this huge obsession about achievement, getting more financially successful and getting a better house, etc. Or this obsession with making more money and taking more trips to Europe. There’s this obsession with that. But why is it like this? So it’s really about the journey to the destination and not the achievement itself. Yes. Your own personal experience is coming from being and working with professional athletes. How can those who work traditional 9-to-5s also achieve this inner excellence? The thesis of the book really is that self-centeredness is the biggest challenge we face in performance and in life. It leads to fear, because your subconscious knows in your heart it’s what’s running your life. And it knows every weakness, every failure. And so when you think about yourself, it reminds yourself of that. So then you start to compare yourself to others and feel bad, then you get stressed and anxious. Whereas when you’re performing your best at anything, all of us, whether it’s you for a deadline or me coaching, or A.J. Brown catching footballs, we’re our best when there’s no thoughts about self. That’s what inner excellence is about, is how you get to be fully alive and then everything in your life expands and improves. So how do you achieve it? The number one goal every day is to learn and grow. Within that are the four daily goals. Number one is to give your best shot every day. Give a hundred percent of what you have today. It’s also really important to realize you’re not gonna be your best all the time, and that’s okay. That’s life. You don’t need to be at your best. We just want to give the best of what you have. Some days you’re only gonna have 50% give, so give a hundred percent of that 50. Number two is to be present. When you’re fully present, there’s no fear. There’s no past or future. There’s no self concern, no self-protection. So inner excellence is really about mastering the ego, pursuing what you really want and the person you’re meant to become. So you can live a life fully engaged heart, mind, body, independent of your result and circumstances. Number three is gratitude, which is directly linked to inner peace, inner strength and mental toughness. To improve your gratitude, we wanna look for three small moments every day. The smallest moments to train your subconscious to have more gratitude. And number four is to focus on your routines and only what you can control. The book’s latest version was published five years ago. How was it finding out about this viral moment that led to so many people buying a copy this week? So it’s interesting. I’m in downtown Dallas on Sunday, and I don’t know anyone here except for my clients, and I haven’t seen them yet. So I’m looking at this skyscraper and I’m all by myself, kind of lonely, and I look up at it and I was like, “huh, would I trade owning that skyscraper for having understood and written my second book?” And I thought I wouldn’t. So really putting the Inner Excellence thinking into practice. I hadn’t watched the [Eagles versus Packers] game yet, and then all these messages started coming into my phone and then everything unfolded.

Title: Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos Are All Headed to Trump’s Inauguration

It should come as no surprise at this point, but NBC News is reporting that Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos will all be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. What do all of these tech leaders have in common? They have all publicly come out with varying degrees of support for Trump’s incoming administration, and all three have donated money to his campaign or the inauguration. It represents a major pivot from Trump’s first time in office when the tech industry kept its distance from him and eventually booted him from their services altogether following the January 6 Capitol riots. Zuckerberg in particular has gone from having a quite acrimonious relationship with Trump, who threatened him with prison over his stance on moderating conservative content, but now feels better about him as Zuckerberg has promised to loosen content restrictions on Meta’s platforms, gotten rid of the company’s DEI programs, and put in place an outspoken Republican to lead its policy arm. Bezos, as the owner of the Washington Post, regularly received barbs from Trump his first go around and saw the possibility of USPS prices charged to Amazon being raised in retaliation for his newspaper’s coverage. Meta and Amazon have both donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and Elon Musk of course aggressively spent money campaigning for Trump’s re-election. He will be helping to cut government spending through DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, and has been looking to hire more figures from tech to staff the initiative. According to NBC, the three tech leaders will be seated “on the platform near cabinet officials and elected leaders.” What is perhaps most notable about Silicon Valley’s pivot towards Trump is just how out in the open it all is. Whereas in the past an investigative journalist might have needed to do some digging to discover pay-for-play schemes, none of the tech leaders here are hiding what they are doing. They are pulling out all the stops to get on Trump’s good side, prevent any attacks he might bring, and perhaps get preferential treatment for lucrative defense contracts. This despite the fact that tech employees tend to be much more liberal than their employers. But these leaders must figure the pros of supporting Trump outweigh the cons. Especially now that the tech industry has gone through massive layoffs in recent years, rank-and-file engineers do not have the power they once had.

Title: Meta Cuts 5% of Workforce to ‘Move Out Low-Performers,’ Zuckerberg Says

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting 3,620 jobs Another day, another round of big changes at Meta: The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting roughly 5% of its workforce — or 3,620 employees — as it looks to “move out low-performers faster,” according to a memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that was obtained by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Zuckerberg said the cuts are coming after he “decided to raise the bar” on performance” at his company. “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,” Zuckerberg said. The 40-year-old Meta founder said employees who are laid off will be notified starting on February 10. Meta’s headcount at the end of September, the most recent period data is available for, was 72,404. Zuckerberg’s memo on the job cuts adds to a busy start to 2025 for the company. Notably, Meta ended its third-party fact checking operation last week, with Zuckerberg saying the move was about “restoring free expression” on Facebook and Instagram, where he said the fact checkers had made “too many mistakes” in recent years. Meta will be rolling out a new feature similar to X’s Community Notes, Zuckerberg said. On Friday, Zuckerberg compared the fact checking operation to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984,” while appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast. He added the Biden Administration “basically pushed” the company to censor certain topics, including what the government felt was COVID-19 misinformation. And in other Meta news, the company announced it was ending its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs on Friday. Meta’s stock price is up 1.1% on the year to $596.27 per share.

Title: Is Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Right About Quantum Computing?
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/is-nvidias-jensen-huang-right-about-quantum-computing/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T20:12:07Z

“Very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away,” Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote presentation at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week. His comment sent shockwaves through the quantum computing industry, with shares of leading companies like Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum and IonQ plummeting between 30 and 50 percent. These companies’ CEOs were quick to defend their industry in a bid to win back investor confidence. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Jensen Huang has a misunderstanding of quantum. He is ‘dead wrong’ about D-Wave,” Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave Quantum, which develops quantum computing systems, told Observer. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. Our (D-Wave) systems are performing scientific computations on important problems that are not solvable by even massively parallel GPU systems.” D-Wave uses quantum annealing, an approach that excels in solving specific computational optimization problems. This method is particularly useful for materials simulation, scheduling and logistics applications. “Commercial quantum computing is already here,” Baratz added. For example, Canada-based Pattison Food Group reduced an 80-hour scheduling task to 15 hours using D-Wave’s technology. Another client, NTT DOCOMO, Japan’s largest telecom provider, slashed the time to optimize network resources from 27 hours to just 40 seconds. Quantum computing CEOs are also talking up their companies’ revenue and profit prospects. D-Wave estimated its 2024 sales jumped 120 percent from the previous year. IonQ, which makes quantum computers, predicts it will turn a profit on more than $1 billion in sales by 2030, CEO Peter Chapman wrote in a blog post on Jan. 10. Quantum computing relies on qubits—units of data that can exist in multiple states at once—and holds the potential to quickly solve calculations that would take even supercomputers a thousand years. Exciting recent developments include Google’s Willow chip, which solved a random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark problem in just five minutes. RCS, one of the most challenging benchmarks for quantum computers, would take today’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years (1 followed by 24 zeros) to solve, Google claims. However, showcasing potential is different than consistently solving problems. “Quantum systems are highly susceptible to environmental noise, which can disrupt quantum computations. Nick Harris, CEO and co-founder of Lightmatter, an Alphabet-backed photonic computing startup, told Observer. “The breakthrough of Google’s Willow chip does not apply to all quantum computing hardware platforms, and the reality today is that scaling up is nowhere near a given.” Other major challenges include scaling qubit systems while preserving their coherence and connectivity, as well as improving qubit fidelity. “Even with error correction, individual qubit operations still carry a non-zero error rate. Reducing these errors further is essential for achieving reliable computations,” Harris explained. The quantum computing industry is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2035, according to McKinsey & Company. However, Huang’s remarks brought that lofty vision back down to earth. Huang predicted it would be 15 to 30 years before quantum computing is commercially viable. Daniela Herrmann, co-founder of Dynex, a quantum-as-a-service company, partially agrees with that assessment. “Huang’s extended timeline reflects the broader understanding of the challenges in achieving fully developed quantum systems, but it doesn’t fully acknowledge the progress being made by existing quantum-inspired applications,” Herrmann told Observer. She noted that Huang’s remarks seem to keep the spotlight on initiatives like Nvidia’s CUDA-Q, which is yet to solve real-world problems at scale. Quantum computing companies, including Phasecraft, Zapata Computing and Algorithmiq, are making notable strides in developing algorithms that can leverage the limited capabilities of existing quantum hardware. Moreover, advancements in quantum computation optimization are also being spearheaded by the University of Chicago and Stanford University, with recent initiatives focusing on optical computing and exploring its applications in quantum technologies. “Advanced language model A.I. tasks that previously required extensive resources are now being completed with 90 percent less computational overhead,” Herrmann said. “Many tangible business cases don’t necessarily require a universal (gate-model) quantum computer to provide advantages,” Anders Indset, chairman of Njordis Group, a VC firm investing in quantum technology companies, told Observer. “Recent sharp dip seems more like a near-term market correction than a final verdict on quantum’s future. ” Indset believes that Huang’s own economic interests in the field could influence his desire to slow down potential competitors. “While Jensen Huang’s caution may reflect the tough realities ahead, history shows that breakthroughs can come faster than expected,” he said. “A.I.’s voracious need for compute resources is pushing the industry to explore new hardware frontiers—quantum included. Once quantum machines achieve a certain threshold, they could supercharge A.I. by making specific training or inference tasks dramatically faster.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: The race to succeed Larry Fink just got a little more interesting as a top contender exits BlackRock

Time Published: 2025-01-14T20:07:56Z
Full Content:
A top BlackRock executive, Mark Wiedman, who was considered a prospective successor to CEO Larry Fink, is leaving the world's largest asset manager, a person familiar with the matter said. Wiedman, who most recently led BlackRock's global client business, was one of two senior executives that insiders at the $11.5 trillion firm considered most likely to replace Fink, Business Insider previously reported. Wiedman, 54, has chosen to pursue opportunities outside the firm and plans to stay on through the spring, the person familiar with the matter said. A veteran of BlackRock who has been with the firm for two decades, Wiedman joined from the US Treasury Department and rose up the ranks. He was responsible for the integration and growth of its exchange-traded-fund business, iShares, and helped establish FMA, the firm's influential consulting arm. The Financial Times earlier reported his planned departure. Fink, who turned 72 in November, had a blockbuster 2024, announcing three big acquisitions in hopes of bringing BlackRock closer to dominating the world of private markets. In December, BlackRock said it was set to buy HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit behemoth managing $148 billion. Fink, who cofounded BlackRock in 1988, has been more vocal over the past year about the firm's growth plans than about whom he plans to pass the business on to. But he previously said that he had "no higher pri­or­ity" than put­ting together a team to replace him­ and Rob Kapito, Black­Rock's pres­id­ent. The news of Wiedman's exit comes a day before BlackRock is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings. Rob Goldstein, the firm's chief operating officer, along with Wiedman, has been named as a prospective successor to Fink. Other names in the mix have included Martin Small, the chief financial officer and global head of corporate strategy, Rachel Lord, the head of international, and Stephen Cohen, who was promoted to chief product officer last year. Last January, Salim Ramji, another executive considered a prospective successor, left and joined Vanguard as its chief executive in July. Wiedman's exit will likely be seen internally as a surprise. Rebecca Ungarino reported for BI in January 2024 that it had "always been Weidman" at the front of the race. A person familiar with the matter told her: "Now, it's hard to predict when a transition may happen. The senior-most officers of the firm thought the transition would have taken place awhile ago. Larry is definitely taking his sweet time." Jump to

(Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s senior executive Mark Wiedman, who was touted to be a potential successor to CEO Larry Fink, is departing the firm, said two sources familiar with the matter. Wiedman will leave in the spring, said the sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity. One of the sources said Wiedman is leaving to pursue other opportunities. The departure is friendly and on good terms, the source said. Wiedman's departure, reported by the Financial Times earlier on Tuesday, comes a year after another executive, Salim Ramji, left BlackRock in January 2024 and went on to become the CEO of asset management company Vanguard Group, which was announced in May 2024. Ramji was also once touted to be a potential successor to Fink. BlackRock declined to comment when asked for more information. Wiedman, who was the head of global client business at BlackRock in his most recent role, held several key positions at the company since he joined in 2004 from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). He was one of the key figures in the asset manager's push towards a low carbon economy, helping sustainable investments grow from $107 billion to $1 trillion, according to the company website. He also acted as the global head of iShares and Index investments, between 2011 and 2019, which grew from $500 billion to $1.7 trillion. The departure comes as the company's assets grew to record highs in 2024 and after large acquisitions last year aimed at increasing BlackRock's footprint in private credit and infrastructure. BlackRock is due to report its 2024 fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday.

Wiedman, head of the global client business for the past two years, was believed to be a potential successor to Chief Executive Larry Fink. Wiedman was instrumental in driving BlackRock's growth in passive investing. From 2011 to 2019, he led BlackRock's exchange-traded and index strategies while assets under management in the business increased from $500 billion to $1.7 trillion. He joined BlackRock in 2004 to oversee the firm's emergency assistance to governments and financial institutions during the financial crisis. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with assets under management hitting a record $11.5 trillion in the fourth quarter. The firm made two big acquisitions last year in a push to expand in private credit and alternatives. In December, the financial firm agreed to buy HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion in stock, as BlackRock looks to grow its presence in the highly popular private credit space. BlackRock also acquired Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investor, for $12.5 billion last year. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi, a senior managing director at BlackRock and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investing platform, has joined OpenAI’s board, OpenAI announced on Tuesday. In a statement, OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor said that Ogunlesi has “an exceptional track record of driving success in organizations with global reach, expertly navigating complex, and dynamic commercial landscapes.” Ogunlesi spent 23 years at financial services company Credit Suisse, where he held several positions, including executive vice chairman of Credit Suisse’s investment banking division. Previously, Ogunlesi was an attorney with the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and served as a law clerk to Thurgood Marshall, the nation’s first Black U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Ogunlesi also sits on the boards of BlackRock, Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings, and Terminal Investment Limited. “The rapid advancement and development of AI offers a unique opportunity to build a better future. As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI’s full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly,” Ogunlesi said in a press release. “I’m excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI board.” OpenAI’s current board bares little resemblance to its board in late 2023, the members of which fired CEO Sam Altman only to reinstate him days later. As a condition for returning, Altman demanded a remade board — and he eventually got his wish. OpenAI’s board today includes Taylor, Altman, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former NSA director Paul M. Nakasone, former Sony Corporation of America President Nicole Seligman, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, economist Larry Summers, and Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Zico Kolter.

Title: Jim Cramer on Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): ‘It Just Gets Better And Better And Butt Better’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, "The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow." Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the "QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers." Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented "But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher." As a result, Cramer shared "I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains." Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants "fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum." Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show," he stated. Cramer added "Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower." He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being "worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell" the world's leading GPU designer. Another player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that "He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth." The CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared: "When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it. And I looked at him, and I said what do we do? And he said, it's every man for himself. And we tore. . . .I mean it really, it's so frightening. Because it can leap. People think it's static. And when it comes, it explodes, where it's crackling. It does not light up and burn. It explodes! So that's what we're dealing with." He added "I just want people to know that this is not a fire where there's coming down. This is a fire where you don't know where it's gonna go. And it can go a hundred yards." As for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him "A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year. It's interesting to hear the perspective of people who cash but who don't own anything. There is money out there waiting for that level. So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired last Wednesday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 43 Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a data analytics company that has been one of the hottest stocks in 2024. Its shares gained more than 350% in 2024 on the back of several catalysts. These include double-digit revenue growth in several quarters in the US commercial market and investor hopes about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) being able to provide the US government with AI services. Cramer has been a fan of the stock in his recent appearances, and he has repeatedly talked about CEO Alex Carp. Here's what he said: "Palantir being the nearest one that Cathie Wood's been an aggressive seller at Ark. She'd been a big believer. I got the Alex Carp biography yesterday. It turned out to be 37 pages. I got to get the different one. There's like three of them. Overall PLTR ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX): Buzzing on Hyve

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX) on ValueInvestorsClub by RugPull1995. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SNX. The company’s shares were trading at $115.50 when this thesis was published, vs. the closing price of $132.84 on Jan 13. A technical analyst using a cloud-based analytics dashboard for financial services. SNX operates as a distributor and solutions aggregator for the information technology (IT) ecosystem. The company offers personal computing devices and peripherals, mobile phones and accessories, printers, supplies, and endpoint technology software; and data center technologies, such as hybrid cloud, security, storage, networking, servers, technology software, and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. It also provides systems design and rack integration, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assembly. SNX is the leading IT distributor in North America and Europe, with a global market share of 16%. While growth in this segment has stalled, Hyve, a business that manufactures servers, storage and networking equipment for hyperscalers, has tremendous potential. 40% of Hyve’s business comes from Meta and there is potential to strike a deal with Oracle in the next year. The cloud capex for Meta and Oracle are projected to be 13% and 32% from 2024 to 2027 and will have a direct bearing on Hyve’s business. With increasing geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, it provides more business opportunities as mega players like Meta, Microsoft and Amazon look to build onshore capabilities. This segment offers a higher margin and a better growth prospect compared to the distribution segment. The core business is also expected to witness an up-cycle from 2025. The demand for PCs during Covid surged due to work-from-home requirements. The average life of these PCs is 5 years, making 2025 the terminal year that would prompt users to buy new PCs. The fundamental logic can be applied to servers, network equipment and storage as well but with a slightly wider timeline i.e. 2020-2022. The stock trades at 10x its 2024 EPS and 8x based on its 2025 EPS estimates. Separately valuing Hyve at 10.5x its EBIT multiple and 9x for SNX’s other business yields a fair value of $157, implying a potential 19% upside with low risk. While we acknowledge the potential of SNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is JD.com, Inc. (JD) Top Stock Pick in Billionaire George Soros’ Portfolio?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) stands against other top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros' portfolio. When it comes to financial lore, you’d struggle to find an investor who is as controversial as George Soros. With a net worth of $7.2 billion, Soros has made a name for himself by correctly spotting market trends, which has led to millions, if not billions, of dollars in strategic savings or profits. He cemented his reputation in financial legend, for instance, when he famously shorted the British pound in 1992 and made off with $1 billion profit in a single day. Soros is also known for overseeing the Quantum Fund, which from 1970 to 2000 produced an outstanding average yearly return of 30%. Having founded his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, back in the 1970s, Soros’ investment philosophy is centered around his concept of “reflexivity”. Soros believes that players in the market can influence the market themselves, causing feedback loops that can cause price deviations. The investor makes use of this idea to single out mispricings in the market to create returns. The best application for this concept is during economic bubbles. According to Soros, “When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire”. Of course, that doesn’t mean one can always hit the bullseye; we saw this during the dot-com era almost 25 years ago where Soros admitted to being beaten by billions of dollars in losses. Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio contained $6.92 billion in securities as of September 30, up from $5.56 billion a quarter earlier. About 9.8% and 7.4% of those securities were in the technology and services sectors, respectively, down from 11.7% and 10.6% from the quarter prior. Healthcare, basic materials, and financials also constituted a sizable portion of the fund’s portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024. It’s no surprise to anyone who has followed George Soros over the years that the billionaire has a certain disdain for artificial intelligence. Soros claims that the technology poses a significant threat, especially to what he calls “open societies”, simply because AI can not only produce instruments of surveillance, but it can also be liable in its misuse. In Soros’ ideal world, AI regulations would have to be globally enforceable, though he admits that such a dream might not be realized because of the dynamics of governance across the globe. In a MarketWatch article from 2023, Soros outlined some of his thoughts regarding the technology. Here’s what he wrote: “We, human beings, are both participants and observers in the world in which we live. As participants we want to change the world in our favor; as observers we want to understand reality as it is. These two objectives interfere with each other. I regard this as an important insight which allows me to distinguish between right and wrong. For this article we scanned Soros Fund Management’s Q3 portfolio and chose its top 10 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund’s stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide and imposing view of a supply chain distribution center, illustrating the company's technology capabilities. Soros Fund Management’s stake as of Q3: $109.2 million JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is a leading Chinese e-commerce company that specializes in computers and other electronic products, all the while operating as a supply chain-focused tech provider. Making use of its logistics network, JD.com has secured its position as a key player in China’s online retail market. The company’s leadership in China’s 2025 national trade-in program is expected to drive notable growth, with Citi affirming a Buy rating on the JD stock alongside a price target of $51, signaling decent potential upside. The 2025 trade-in initiative, launched on January 1, reaches more than 90% of China’s counties and rural areas. Citi believes that JD’s strong supply chain, omni-channel strategy, and partnerships with provinces like Jiangsu can position the company as a preferred partner for local governments. In the fiscal third-quarter of 2024, JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) reported a 48% year-over-year surge in net profit to $1.62 billion, driven by a 5.1% revenue increase to $260.39 billion. The company’s largest revenue segment, Retail sales, also grew by 6.1%, while logistics sales jumped by 7.9%. Overall, JD ranks 6th on our list of top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros' portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of JD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Predicts XRP, Solana ETFs Will Attract up to $8,000,000,000 Each: Report

JPMorgan Chase expects that potential Solana (SOL) and XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could see multi-billion dollar inflows. VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel reports on the social media platform X that JPMorgan says SOL and XRP ETFs could attract up to $16 billion in total. “SOL & XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) Could Attract $3-8bn Each: JPM ETP assets ($108bn) make up 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap ($1,874bn) after the ETPs’ first year of trading; likewise, ether ETP assets ($12bn) have a 3% penetration rate of the total Ethereum market cap ($395bn) within its first 6 months since launch. When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3-6bn of new net assets and XRP gathering $4-8bn in net new assets.” Last year, the chief executive of VanEck said that a Solana ETF could only be possible if the Republicans won the US Presidential Election. And last winter, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said it “makes sense” for an XRP ETF to eventually be approved. “I think it makes sense that there will be other ETFs. It’s sort of like the earliest days of the stock market – you don’t really want exposure to one stock, or one company, you want to typically think about diversifying risk and what have you. I think we will see other [crypto] ETFs. When we will see them is hard to predict. The sad reality of what we saw with the Bitcoin ETF is [it happened] only because the courts forced the SEC’s hand, and really [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler’s hand.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Redshinestudio/Sensvector Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: What Would Be Worse Than Death To TikTok? Elon Musk Buying It!

Time Published: 2025-01-14T19:01:23Z

Anybody else sad about a potential TikTok ban? Just me? Love the platform, it brings back memories of having cable television and flipping channels for hours. I downloaded it to make sure the children were not showing too much front or back cleavage on there while they recorded themselves doing the floss-dance, and now I use it more than they do. I’ve discovered artists I never would have (Doechii!), learned to fix food I never would otherwise (cucumber salads!) and there’s good news content on there too (Under The Desk!) Anyway, the TikTok ban from app stores is set to take effect Sunday, and UGH, Bloomberg has reported that no grosser of an oligarch than Elon Musk is wanting to buy it, which would be the only thing worse than it disappearing from app stores on Sunday. Just what the world needs, another platform forcing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and racist Pepes in front of your eyeballs! Bloomberg’s report, based on “people familiar with the matter” seems kind of sus from the jump, though, starting with the first line, “Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok.” 订阅！(Subscribe!) First of all, the Chinese government doesn’t own TikTok, though a Chinese guy founded it, and was never incorporated there. It’s owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, with servers (where the algorithm happens) in Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. Three of the company's five board members are Americans, and the other two are based in Hong Kong and Singapore. Content moderation happens in Ireland. User data is not stored in China. Founder Zhang Yiming is not a Chinese official, and even if he were, how would Chinese officials be able to do shit about shit or sell anything that they do not own? Bloomberg, you are sloppy. TikTok has denied any talks of a sale to Musk. Furthermore, its US operations are worth about $50 billion, so would Elon even have that kind of liquidity to put up 12 percent of his net worth in cash, especially after reportedly promising to use his cash to primary any Republicans who vote against Pete Hegseth’s confirmation? Even for him, that’s kind of a lot. And would board members ever approve such a sale, considering the guy anti-Rumplestiltskinned his $44 billion investment in Twitter to a value of $15 billion because advertisers and users have fled it like a hot turd? Sounds most likely that “people familiar with the matter” was Elon, after smoking a bone in his owl hoodie. (ICYMI) This whole very unprecedented ban is such entire bullshit, nothing more than Trump getting his way, which he openly admits. About 40 percent of people between 18-29 say they get their news from TikTok, and he fucking hated that so many people were talking shit about him on an app with 170 million users that he could not control. So Mike Johnson crammed the ban into the Republicans’ $95 billion foreign aid package. But then Jeff Yass invested in Trump’s shitty media platform, and flew down to Florida to kiss Trump’s ass, and the algorithm started being nice to Trump, and helped him win young voters, so then he liked it again. As you know, I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack. He was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don't know why. Maybe it's changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we're up 35 percent with youth. And I used TikTok, so I can't really, you know — I can't totally hate it. It was very effective. PREVIOUSLY! The ban was ALL about him opposing the expression of opinions and words, which is as un-First Amendment-y as it gets. Also notable, the end of TikTok will mean the end of income for millions of content creators and revenue for about 7 million small businesses on there, some of whom do quite well. TikTok drove $15 billion in revenue to small businesses in 2023 and contributed $24.2 billion to the US GDP. The Bill was called “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” and singles out TikTok in particular, even though it is not controlled by a foreign adversary. It is not an app without sin, it must be said; the company has been investigated over its (American) employees tracking multiple journalists covering it, and in 2022 the company fired the chief internal auditor who led the team responsible for them. But there’s no evidence that the Chinese government ever wanted or got the spoils of that snoopery. Also TikTok detractors claim that the algorithm is a “black box,” but so is every social media platform’s feed. And TikTok’s seems more obvious than most: Linger on something longer, you see more of it, skip it and you see less. This is how I wound up with a feed that is mostly men styling their hair into pompadours, and rare Duran Duran performances. Anyway, Trump ran to the Supreme Court and filed a law-free brief about how he alone can save TikTok, and the Supremes are still mulling it over. Also Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey has introduced a bill, “Extend the TikTok Deadline Act,” which would give ByteDance another 270 days to sell the app, and now even Rand Paul is against its shutdown. The ban doesn’t need to be slowed down, it needs to be stopped, because banning shit is not who we are, and all of this sits on a throne of fibs! Meanwhile, the number one download in the Apple Store is Xiaohongshu (Red Note), which is literally the Chinese TikTok. The icon looks like this. And after about 12 hours of trying, I got my number verified on there! And it is delightful, in its own kind way. It’s sort of like being in actual China, but without having to sit on a plane for 12 hours or risk getting giardia from an ice cube. Much of it’s in Chinese, but there’s just enough English so you can get by. The Hongshu-ers seem puzzled by the influx, but friendly, reaching out to TikTok refugees with greetings and content everybody enjoys, such as cat pictures, stir-fry recipes, and Luigi Mangione rendered in cappuccino foam. What a turn of events, a ban meant to drive Americans and Chinese people apart bringing them closer together than ever. Will SCOTUS decide to halt the ban? Will Chinese TikTok take off? We shall see! If the ban passes the app will still exist on your phone, there just won’t be any software updates, and at some point it will break or become obsolete. Until then, get in those cucumber recipes and floss dances and pompadour tips while you still can. [Bloomberg archive link/ CNN/ Forbes archive link/ Oxford Economics ] Follow me on Bluesky! Share Donate one time! I know they're calling it Red Note, but 小红书 is literally "Little Red Book." Mao's last joke from the grave? "with servers (where the algorithm happens) in Virginia" that's AWS us-east-1. They have servers there, sure. You cannot fucking tell me they're not multi region though. TikTok is AWS-based. "User data is not stored in China." Bull fucking shit. https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/about-aws/china/ I will bet you a gentleperson's bet of $1 to wonkette that they are replicating to the AWS China regions, at least one of them.

Title: Jim Cramer on Tapestry, Inc. (TPR) ‘Clearly Didn’t Get Sidetracked’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, "The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow." Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the "QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers." Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented "But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher." As a result, Cramer shared "I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains." Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants "fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum." Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show," he stated. Cramer added "Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower." He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being "worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell" the world's leading GPU designer. Another player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that "He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth." The CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared: "When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it. And I looked at him, and I said what do we do? And he said, it's every man for himself. And we tore. . . .I mean it really, it's so frightening. Because it can leap. People think it's static. And when it comes, it explodes, where it's crackling. It does not light up and burn. It explodes! So that's what we're dealing with." He added "I just want people to know that this is not a fire where there's coming down. This is a fire where you don't know where it's gonna go. And it can go a hundred yards." As for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him "A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year. It's interesting to hear the perspective of people who cash but who don't own anything. There is money out there waiting for that level. So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand."

Title: Jim Cramer on Paychex Inc. (PAYX) CEO John B. Gibson: ‘He Was Looking At The Paychex Stubs. And He Saw The Hiring Explosion’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, "The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow." Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the "QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers." Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented "But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher." As a result, Cramer shared "I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains." Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants "fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum." Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show," he stated. Cramer added "Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower." He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being "worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell" the world's leading GPU designer.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is an important player in the SaaS-based payroll processing services provider market. Since its performance is dependent to a large extent on small and medium business performance, the shares perform well when investors perceive an easing of monetary policy. As a result, the fact that Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)'s shares are flat year-to-date is unsurprising. In fact, had the firm not announced a deal to expand its operations by acquiring Paycor, the stock might have suffered more. Cramer commented on Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO's astute observation of the US economy: "I had John Gibson on recently. He's the CEO of Paychex. And this is the largest payroll processor for small to medium sized businesses. Here's what the Fed did wrong. They didn't, he just got, a Fed advisor, John. The small business outlook post the election was astonishing. And the amount of hiring post the election was incredible. But that was not in any of the models. What J Powell [inaudible] sit around and say, listen if Trump wins we gotta stop, stop cutting? But that was the key fulcrum. What small business, the backbone of the US economy I may add, and we got that wrong. Everyone got it wrong except for Gibson because he was looking at the Paychex stubs. And he saw the hiring explosion." Overall PAYX ranks 18th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of PAYX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI GPU Export Control Rules Likely To Tighten Under Trump Admin, Says Analyst

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Biden Administration's sweeping set of new rules that restrict AI chip sales to countries not aligned with US national security interests are unlikely to be watered down by the incoming Trump Administration, believes a Taiwan-based semiconductor analyst. The export control rules, which came soon after the CES conference in Las Vegas and amidst a fresh set of media reports outlining troubles with Blackwell GPU supplies, drew a sharp backlash from NVIDIA. The company, which commands an effective monopoly over the global AI chip supply chain, called the new export control rules an attempt to "undermine" American technology leadership by placing control of semiconductor exports in bureaucratic hands. The Biden Administration's latest rules divide the countries to which NVIDIA's advanced AI GPUs can be exported into three categories. The first is a list of nations that are either aligned with US national security objectives or are not a threat to the US. These countries can secure the chips without any hindrance. The second category consists of hostile nations such as Russia and Iran, which are completely barred from procuring either US-origin GPUs or AI software. Finally, the third category limits countries such as India from importing large amounts of GPUs without scrutiny. These nations will be able to import 1,700 GPUs without regulatory scrutiny, and they are designed to prevent the targeted countries from building large-scale data centers capable of advanced defense research. The rules also limit key AI software parameters, such as model weights, from being disclosed to nations. NVIDIA's response to them was hard-hitting, as it characterized the rules as threatening to "to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide." NVIDIA admitted that the new rules will not come into effect until 120 days but cautioned that they were already "undercutting U.S. interests." However, despite NVIDIA's praise of the previous Trump presidency in its comments, one analyst believes that the export rules are only set to tighten during the incoming administration. Sharing his thoughts on X, Taipei-based financial analyst Dylan Nystedt outlined several factors that make it unlikely that the issue "might go away under President Trump." He believes that the reality might be different, and "If anything, the rules are likely to become more extreme over time, not less." He starts off by sharing comments made by TSMC's founder, Dr. Morris Chang, in 2023, where he shared his thoughts and remarked that globalization is dead. Dr. Chang had made similar remarks in 2022 and saw a media mogul agree with him. In his 2023 remarks, the former TSMC boss had also supported American policy objectives of slowing down China's progress. Nystedt also believes that supercomputers are helping adversarial nations such as China and Russia to develop advanced military technologies. He outlined, "Supercomputers have already helped Russia and China develop hypersonic missiles, better jet planes and engines, improved nuclear modeling, more." As a consequence, the analyst outlines that the fear among Washington policy circles is that "AI will be able to help adversaries build far better weapons than engineering and design software has already done." He also shared a highly circulated image of a purported Chinese sixth-generation fighter aircraft prototype that appears to rival Northrop Grumman's Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. According to Nystedt, NVIDIA is misguided in its criticism of the US government. He concludes by outlining that "In its [NVIDIA] zeal to drive computing forward for the good of mankind, it forgot evil exists in the world." Nvidia is unlikely to see any change to the new US export rules on ‘AI Diffusion’ unveiled Monday (1/13). It is not an issue that might go away under President Trump. It is a US National Security issue.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Quantum computing stocks climbed during Tuesday morning trading after plunging earlier in the week. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock was up by almost 30% on Tuesday morning, while Quantum Computing (QUBT) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) saw shares up by around 17% and 15%, respectively. IonQ (IONQ) shares climbed by around 2%. The stocks fell slightly closer to noon, with Rigetti up by around 13%, D-Wave up by around 9%, and Quantum Computing up by almost 6%. IonQ shares fell by more than 2%. Both D-Wave and Rigetti saw shares fall by more than 25% during mid-day trading on Monday after Meta (META) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts on quantum computing’s potential in the near future. During an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, which was published Friday, Zuckerberg said he sees the technology’s usefulness a “decade-plus out.” “I’m not really an expert on quantum computing — my understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Quantum Computing shares fell by around 23%, while IonQ stock was down by more than 12% mid-day Monday. The previous week, the stocks also tanked after Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang shared similar sentiments that useful quantum computers are decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang said he sees the chipmaker, a major player in the artificial intelligence boom, playing “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, which will be able to quickly solve problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years to complete. After Huang’s comments sent stocks falling, D-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said the Nvidia chief “has a misunderstanding of quantum,” in a statement shared with Quartz. “While he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,” Baratz said. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.” For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Ogunlesi is a founding partner of Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investing firm that was acquired by BlackRock last year for $12 billion. Before helping to start GIP in 2006, Ogunlesi spent 23 years at Credit Suisse. "The rapid advancement and development of AI offers a unique opportunity to build a better future," Ogunlesi said in OpenAI's announcement Tuesday. "As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI's full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly. I'm excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI Board." For OpenAI, the addition of Ogunlesi to its board marks another step in its dramatic transformation to a for-profit company. The board has been almost entirely revamped since late 2023, when CEO Sam Altman was abruptly ousted before being quickly reinstated. Former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who was chairman at Twitter before its purchase by Elon Musk, became chair of OpenAI after the Altman ordeal in November 2023. Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, joined at the same time. Last year, the board added several new faces including Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now known as the Gates Foundation. OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, said in late December that it will create a public benefit corporation to oversee commercial operations, removing some of its nonprofit restrictions and allowing it to function more like a high-growth startup. Last year, OpenAI was valued at $157 billion as it continued rolling out updated large language models and new tools after kicking off the generative artificial intelligence boom in late 2022. The company said that by transforming into a Delaware PBC "with ordinary shares of stock," it can pursue commercial operations while separately hiring a staff for its nonprofit arm and allowing that wing to take on charitable activities in health care, education and science, OpenAI said in December. Musk, one of OpenAI's co-founders is suing to try and stop OpenAI from converting into a full for-profit business.

Title: I've had Costco's executive membership for 17 years. My family swears by these 11 products for easy dinners.

I've been a Costco executive member for about 17 years now, and I rely on the warehouse chain when buying groceries for my family of four. Our executive membership is a huge help for saving money. Although it costs more than a standard Costco membership, we get an annual 2% back on eligible purchases. For us, it pays for itself and then some every year. Here are Costco meal staples I buy for prepping dinner for myself, my husband, and our two teens. Prices may vary by location. My family prefers thighs to breasts as they're more flavorful, easier to cook, and often cheaper. So, we stock up on Kirkland Signature boneless, skinless thighs and freeze whatever we don't use right away. We often grill them, slather them in mayonnaise to make family-favorite Parmesan-crusted chicken, toss them into soups, or chop them up for stir-fries. At Costco, we head to the meat counter and ask the butcher if we can buy the 10-pound tube of ground beef. We prefer this over the smaller package trays on display in the meat section, mostly because of the price. On a recent trip, the tube cost $4.39 a pound — 10 cents cheaper a pound than the other packages of ground beef available. When I pack this for freezing, I squeeze portions straight from the tube into my vacuum-sealing bags, which is much easier than picking chunks out of the foam trays. We usually pick up a 24-ounce Earthbound Farms organic Caesar-salad kit for $9. It pairs nicely with grilled chicken or steak and a baguette for a light but pleasing dinner that requires little effort. On a good day, our kids prep the salad and my husband grills the meat we add to it. On movie nights, I make homemade pizza. I already prepare my own dough and sauce, so I want my cheese pre-shredded. I like using Kirkland Signature shredded mozzarella because it's dry enough not to bog down a pizza. I pick up the 5-pound twin pack and break the bags into pizza-night-sized portions that I freeze until I'm ready to use. Kirkland Signature spinach-and-cheese ravioli are handy when I want to toss together ravioli pomodoro in a flash. These are also good for ravioli "lasagna," where these replace typical noodles as a shortcut to save time and use fewer ingredients. I love Garofalo tricolor organic pasta and can sometimes get six 1-pound packages for $10 at Costco. The colors and shapes are fun, and the pasta is delicious. I use the noodles to make all sorts of dinners, from cacio e pepe to pasta Bolognese. I can get 60 Trident fish sticks for $15 at Costco, and they're super convenient when I don't feel like cooking a full meal. I pop these babies in the oven, then pair them with frozen fries, peas, and tartar sauce for fish and chips with little-to-no effort. We usually pick up a 2-pound bag of Kirkland Signature raw, tail-on shrimp for about $12. I like to pair the shrimp with fries and roasted vegetables for a low-effort meal. The kids usually mix up cocktail sauce to go with the shrimp, too. The Kirkland Signature Normandy vegetable mix is hard to beat at $11 for 5 ½ pounds of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. If freezer space is low, I break up the large bag into smaller packages. Fortunately, frozen vegetables can be used in so many ways. I put them in soups and pasta primavera. I've also leaned into treating veggies like meat, so I toss them in olive oil and spice rubs and roast them as a side. Lotus Foods organic millet-and-brown-rice ramen noodles are one of my favorite gluten-free finds at Costco. We tried them after learning about my daughter's gluten allergy, and I like that the noodles have a texture our whole family enjoys. We make a lot of soup dishes in the winter and these noodles never disappoint, whether we're using them in khao soi or ramen. They're a great deal at Costco, too. We pay $9 for 30 ounces of noodles, which works out to 30 cents an ounce. At our local grocery store, these can cost $7 for a 10-ounce package — or 70 cents an ounce. My husband has fallen in love with quinoa, which works for me because I hate rice. This grain serves as a nice base for a lot of our meals that typically use the former. I buy the 4-½- pound bag of Kirkland Signature organic quinoa for $9. It lasts us a while and we've learned this is way cheaper than buying quinoa at our local grocery store.

Description: It's been a tumultuous week for quantum computing companies, to say the least, with several stocks in the landscape — Quantum Computing (QUBT), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), IonQ (IONQ) — selling off following comments made by Nvidia (NVDA)…

Title: Quantum computing stocks soar after Meta and Nvidia CEO's doubts tanked them

Quantum computing stocks climbed during Tuesday morning trading after plunging earlier in the week. Rigetti Computing (RGTI+23.74%) stock was up by almost 30% on Tuesday morning, while Quantum Computing (QUBT+53.03%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS+23.68%) saw shares up by around 17% and 15%, respectively. IonQ (IONQ+34.60%) shares climbed by around 2%. The stocks fell slightly closer to noon, with Rigetti up by around 13%, D-Wave up by around 9%, and Quantum Computing up by almost 6%. IonQ shares fell by more than 2%. Both D-Wave and Rigetti saw shares fall by more than 25% during mid-day trading on Monday after Meta (META+4.31%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts on quantum computing’s potential in the near future. During an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, which was published Friday, Zuckerberg said he sees the technology’s usefulness a “decade-plus out.” “I’m not really an expert on quantum computing — my understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Quantum Computing shares fell by around 23%, while IonQ stock was down by more than 12% mid-day Monday. The previous week, the stocks also tanked after Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) chief executive Jensen Huang shared similar sentiments that useful quantum computers are decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang said he sees the chipmaker, a major player in the artificial intelligence boom, playing “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, which will be able to quickly solve problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years to complete. After Huang’s comments sent stocks falling, D-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said the Nvidia chief “has a misunderstanding of quantum,” in a statement shared with Quartz. “While he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,” Baratz said. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Pokémon TCG Is In A Bad Situation, And The Pokémon Company Has To Step Up
URL: https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920
Time Published: 2025-01-14T15:35:00Z
Full Content:
Update: 1/15/2025, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a statement from The Pokémon Company International regarding this situation, which is reproduced in full below. In it, the company states that it is attempting to print more cards for the sniped sets, as well as promising restocks on the Pokémon Center websites in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The original story follows below, with the statement added at the bottom. The Pokémon trading card game (PTCG) is in a really big mess. And once again, it’s because it has become too popular for its own good. If you were hoping to pick up some product from the forthcoming Prismatic Evolutions special sets, well, good luck to you. And March’s just-announced Journey Together set? Pre-orders sold out in literal seconds. Whether it’s because of scalpers, a sudden new tidal wave of interest via Pokémon TCG Pocket, or evil space spiders, The Pokémon Company International desperately needs to react, and fast. I first noticed something was wrong the day that Prismatic Evolutions went up for pre-order on the Pokémon Center website. The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone. The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point, it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong. For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly. So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, often get the jump on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy. I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.” Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable immediately, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker. I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed. So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back. So what’s going on? Well, without a response from TPCi, it’s hard to be certain. But it makes sense to assume it’s directly the fault of bots and scalpers, looking to resell unopened products at vastly inflated prices. Right now, a $60 ETB of Prismatic Evolutions has a resale market price of $400, while others are selling their pre-orders of Journey Together ETBs on eBay for $150+. To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart. What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, like 2023's 151, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s Pokémon TCG Pocket, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now. You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when Pokémon GO caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves. Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly caused Japan to sell out of all Pokémon cards, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English. The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game. And secondly, the game. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy anything new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.) As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems. With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on Kotaku, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.) But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.) I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.) In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done. Update: 01/15/2024, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a detailed reply from TPCi about this situation and the company’s attempts to address the issues with new reprints and restocks of its online stores. There is, however, no information regarding how it might attempt to prevent a repeat of the current situation, with bots and scalpers scooping everything first, nor indeed any mention of the other affected set, March’s Journey Together. Here’s the statement in full: We’re aware that some fans may experience difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products at launch due to high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this. Reprinted products are expected to be available at participating retailers as soon as possible to help ensure more fans receive opportunities to access Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions. In addition, more new products from the Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions lineup will be launching in the coming months. Pokémon Center preorders for Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products that were placed during the preorder timeframe will begin shipping in mid-January. Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products will be restocked at Pokémon Center in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand later this year. Fans can subscribe to the Pokémon Center newsletter to receive updates. We’d like to thank the community for their continued support and patience as we work to deliver this highly anticipated expansion to fans. .

Title: The Dow bounces back 160 points as wholesale inflation falls

The Dow and other indices rebounded on Tuesday following inflation data that came in cooler than anticipated. AI stocks that declined sharply on Monday recovered early Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), Palantir (PLTR+3.77%), Micron Technology (MU+6.40%), and others all rising. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, increased by only 0.2% in December. This figure was lower than the projected rise of 0.4%. Additionally, the Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, remained unchanged. With that, all eyes are on Wednesday’s consumer price index (CPI) report, which measures retail inflation and will help determine whether or not the Fed will lower interest rates this year. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 218 points, or 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 shed 0.25% and 0.35%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been rising in the past few days, declined slightly to 4.78%. Oil prices also decreased, with West Texas Intermediate falling by 0.7%, trading around $78.25 per barrel. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+5.87%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM+2.56%) and UnitedHealth (UNH+0.16%) on Thursday. Bond markets are moving upward, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.78% as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve may delay lowering interest rates until 2026. This situation has also affected other economies. For instance, Japan, which tried to stabilize the economy and the yen last year, saw its 10-year government bond yield surpass 1%, reaching a 13-year high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the UK, 30-year gilt yields are at their highest levels since 1998. India, which is grappling with currency challenges as the rupee declines, saw its 10-year bond yield experience its biggest single-session rise in over a month on Monday, nearing a two-month high of 6.846%.

“The New Life Blueprint: A 21st Century Guide to Success, Health, Wealth, and Happiness in a Complex World” by Natalia Peart, Ph.D. with Christopher Burge, is released with Forbes Books. NEW YORK (January 14, 2025) — The New Life Blueprint: A 21st Century Guide to Success, Health, Wealth, and Happiness in a Complex World by Dr. Natalia Peart with Christopher Burge is now available. Published with Forbes Books, the exclusive business book publishing imprint of Forbes, this groundbreaking guide is available today on Amazon. The world has changed more in the last few years than in the previous fifty. People of all ages and income levels now face pervasive economic worries, from the high cost of living to inflation and the threat of layoffs. These worries have left many feeling vulnerable in their careers, finances, and lives. We’re also dealing with many big shifts and disruptions happening one right after the other or all at once. The epidemics of stress and burnout, as well as the rising anxiety, loneliness, and other mental health struggles, speak to the constant mental and emotional challenges we face. “Traditionally, success was a straightforward formula: get a degree, land a job, work hard, and enjoy the rewards, " Dr. Peart said. “But now, this is a more complex world with constant change and disruption as the norm, so the strategies that once promised a clear path to the American Dream, like pursuing a conventional education or climbing the company ladder, no longer guarantee success or even continual progress toward our goals.” Many of us find ourselves unprepared and uncertain since the old life blueprint and instructions for living a good life no longer apply. Peart and Burge respond to this challenge by reinventing the old blueprint into a modern-era career, mental, financial, and lifestyle blueprint. Their new roadmap provides readers with the instructions and guidance they need to equip and prepare themselves to navigate their professional and personal lives, build resilience in constant uncertainty, and achieve the sustainable success, health, wealth, and happiness they seek. The New Life Blueprint is important because it captures the urgency and necessity for a redefined approach to living in a complex world, making the central idea timely and impactful. Readers will also close the book armed with the knowledge, tools, and confidence to navigate their lives amidst ongoing changes and uncertainties.

Title: The Pharma Man’s Negative Reputation is Fair
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/pharma-man-negative-reputation-fair-1235233914/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T14:30:00Z

By Amal Naj A former senior executive in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Naj divides his time between overseeing medicine companies he has founded and writing; his latest book, Pandastic Times (Brazen House), is a fable of the Covid pandemic. Some two decades ago, when I mentioned what I did for a living — manufacturing and marketing a wide range of prescription drugs — it elicited appreciative reactions from acquaintances. “I take your products every day,” a number of them would offer; others would mention how a specific medicine had made all the difference to their health and would ask whether a more advanced treatment was in the works; some simply marveled at the industry’s innovations as nothing less than miracles. Then there were some who teased: “Good business; you can charge whatever price.” I considered the quip an acknowledgment that lifesaving discoveries were worth the money. Pharma Man, they called me. It seemed to confer a certain respectability, of the sort reserved for a physician or a scientist or a teacher. There was a presumption in it, too, that I lived by certain ideals and ethics demanded of such an avocation. I was proud of being a Pharma Man. Alas, I have now slipped precipitously in their eyes. I am seen as an avaricious man inexorably exploiting the misery of fellow human beings for profit — by inventing one new magic potion after another for which they cannot afford not to pay my price, because the only alternative would be pain and suffering, even death. My onetime champions have grudgingly tolerated this collective subjugation for years. But not anymore. Their festering anger has now broken into an open rebellion against the Pharma Man, the benevolent oppressor. The recent murder of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson in cold blood, a heinous and deplorable expression of this growing rebellion, cannot be condoned in any way. But the health care landscape is littered with provocations against the Pharma Man which play out daily on national television, in the newspapers, and on social media. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The Pharma Man’s reputation is only going to get worse as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and tries to fulfill his promise to bring down drug prices. And there is the specter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. bringing his unconventional ideas to American health care in the new Trump administration; he has already publicly called for capping drug prices. Ironically, it had been the Democrats who made the industry — a financial hotbed of Republican support — a whipping boy in blaming America’s failure to deliver affordable health care to its citizens. But Mr. Trump has outshouted them all. He famously declared that pharma companies were “getting away with murder” and singled out Pfizer Inc. and publicly shamed the company and forced the CEO to roll back planned price increases. As I watched Mr. Trump tower over the CEO at a White House appearance and later triumphantly declare the result of his disciplinary action, I was reminded of my school days when the headmaster would hoist a student by the collar to make the truant admit culpability in front of the class. It was humiliating for the Pharma Man, for I once worked at the company, proud of its pioneering history and its roster of some of the world’s most impactful medicines, a company that would go on to save millions of lives with its Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic. But the Pharma Man has earned this new reputation, and then some. Nothing has been as devastating to the industry’s image as the ongoing opioid crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because companies capriciously pushed sales of the addictive painkillers. The bribing of doctors with cash and sex to prescribe the drugs, widely reported in the media, revealed to the American public the means and the measure of the Pharma Man’s extraordinary avarice. Although much of the hostility is focused on Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, a number of pharma companies with household names, among them Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, have been named in government investigations for directly or indirectly participating in perpetrating the opioid crisis. This follows a string of well-publicized, similar cases in which drug companies have been ostracized for their single-minded devotion to profit.

Instead, She Predicted It Pam Bondi’s AG Hearing Is a Master Class in Trump Flattery In 2016, millions of television viewers must have felt sick to their stomachs listening to the CEO of Mylan admitting to lawmakers that the company had jacked up the price of its EpiPen, a lifesaving treatment for allergic reaction, by 400 percent, because it could in the absence of any competition. The same year, in another congressional hearing, Martin Shkreli, the brash CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the moniker “Bad Boy of Pharma” in the media as he mocked lawmakers and refused to answer when asked why his company had raised prices of decades-old drugs a whopping 5,000 percent. As these very public spectacles played out on national television, they reinforced the perception of millions of Americans who struggle daily with filling their prescriptions and securing coverage from their health insurers, that they are dealing with the devil. I work in a business that’s a highly sophisticated, science-driven enterprise, peopled by brilliant minds, who truly take special pride in what they do. They are not given to making sanctimonious claims that they wake up every morning to save the world — as their companies might in their corporate banners (“Your life is our life’s work”; “Your health is our mission”) — but in their subconscious lurks a deep sense of satisfaction, even joy, that their work ends up easing pain and suffering and saving lives. They see palpable evidence every day in their family members and friends who take the medicines they help bring to the world. But you would never know all this from their public reputation. In annual Gallup polls, the Pharma Man’s business consistently ranks at the very bottom of all industries in public trust, and even in that dishonorable position it slipped further in 2023. Professionally, the Pharma Man ranks below the car salesman for honesty and ethics. It is baffling to me that we as an industry haven’t stepped out in front of the groundswell of national outrage and undertaken systemic changes to our business practices. We continue to conduct our business on the strength of our power over our customers, a power we derive from our possession of the inventions that prevent and treat and cure and which our customers cannot do without. That’s like possessing Tolkien’s One Ring, which gives the possessor unassailable power to rule over and dominate others. We set the price we want. We can cast our spell on doctors to prescribe our medicine and do our bidding. We can banish competitors who attempt to lay claim to our Ring of Power. We have institutionalized this leverage in our business, all the way from drug discovery and development to marketing and sales and distribution. This underpinning of the industry’s colossal machinery is rigged against the patient. No one in the leadership of the pharma industry has raised a voice, let alone stepped up to act, to alter this unfair state endured by their very own customers; it seems there are no hobbits in the industry ready to undertake the treacherous journey to Mount Doom in a quest to destroy the Ring. We refuse to see how our customers see our business. In their minds, we owe our existence to their misfortunes and mishaps: the unexpected cancer, the heart that suddenly fails, the pancreas that fails to produce enough insulin. Our customers turn to us to help them deal with these events of life and living. Although they know it takes a lot of money and time to come up with a treatment, they also expect the pharma company to make it available to them at an affordable price. After all, they argue, axiomatically, the drug was specifically developed to serve their need, brought on by their unfortunate luck. They volunteer in tens of thousands, sick and healthy, for a new drug to be tested on them so the company can prove it works and is safe; some can die from the potential side effects. They are the ones who help create the market for the drug. And to dangle it in front of them but out of their reach by charging unaffordable prices is unconscionable. It is hard to argue against that view: the symbiotic existence between our enterprise and our customers imposes a business — not to mention a moral — obligation on us to make the drug affordable to the patient who was instrumental in the development of the treatment in the first place. We also should not ignore the fact that the U.S. government helps out drug development with taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, our customers cannot rely on market forces for what the pharma companies won’t offer: a fair deal. Car companies, with their zillion features, battle among themselves to win over customers, and any and all of their cars, irrespective of their features, deliver the same result: transporting the buyer from one place to another. One can purchase any smartphone on the market and it will make the call, send messages, browse the web. But when it comes to drugs, the consumer doesn’t necessarily have alternative choices. Take, for instance, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins. Among the seven or so statins developed so far, the most prescribed ones are atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor). Each statin has its own distinct efficacy and side effects, even though they all lower cholesterol. Physicians prescribe one statin or another based on patient condition and the desired outcome. In effect, the market of cholesterol-lowering agents gets divided into distinct segments of therapy, each offering just one single statin. Within each segment there is no competition to speak of (until the patent expires, allowing the entry of copies of the product, the so-called generics). Although the manufacturers compete with their sales and marketing campaigns to recruit patients to their respective statins, this sort of “competition” doesn’t significantly influence the price, as each product is viewed as distinct and un-substitutable, something that the manufacturers take pains to establish with their scientific papers and promotional materials. We are known to shamelessly exploit these monopolistic powers. When we lose a patent on a drug, we pay off competitors to keep them from entering the market. (The Federal Trade Commission estimates that these anticompetitive tactics cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in higher drug costs every year.) Most commonly, we tend to extend patents with minor variations on the original drug, such as a new coating or a slight change in the formulation — this is called evergreening — which offer little or no additional benefits to the patient. (Some 78 percent of the patented drugs marketed between 2005 and 2015 are not new drugs, according to a study published in the Journal of the Law and the Biosciences in December 2018.) Some of our tactics are simply mean. An example: An innovator company that had been selling a medicine in 20- and 40-milligram tablets retired the products once their patents expired and then relaunched only the 40-mg tablet with a score mark in the center. The indented mark would allow the tablet to be evenly split into two halves. The innovator would then use its marketing muscle to corral physicians to endorse it as a single two-in-one pill: 40 mg, and 20 mg when it’s split in two. The two-in-one becomes the new fashion. A generic company that developed unscored tablets is suddenly out of luck; its products fall out of favor with the prescribing physicians, even though the innovator’s scored version offers no improvement in efficacy. We justify the constant push for ever more profit by pointing to the nature of our business. The pursuit of drug discovery and development is inherently risky; there is no other industry that takes on such enormous risks to bring a product to the market. In pharmaceuticals, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a drug to the market, sometimes upwards of a billion or more. Most drugs in development don’t make it. And when a drug does make it, there is a mad rush to recover the investments, including the money lost in all the unsuccessful earlier attempts. The race is against the clock, before the drug’s patent expires, usually within 12 or 13 years after launch. Any thought of making the drug affordable is subsumed by the urgency of squeezing profit out of a drug, no matter how old. So the industry takes the stance that lifesaving discoveries come at a price — and the patient must pay for it. But our customers don’t believe us when we say drug costs are so high because of R&D costs. We do not publish independently audited numbers to substantiate our claims. R&D costs can be inflated by assigning high values to the intellectual and financial capital invested in the drug, for instance. What makes our customers even more skeptical is that we spend far more on marketing our products — those screaming ads on TV and in subways — which adds enormously to the drug’s cost, while strengthening our monopolistic hold on our products. A large truth is that our drug pricing is heavily influenced by our single-minded obsession with keeping our shareholders — not patients — happy. This is not unique to the pharma industry; delivering “shareholder value,” the appreciation of the company’s stock price, is an operational mantra of corporations across industries. Whatever earnest exercise a pharma company goes through to set drug prices based on R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and other costs, at the end of the day this is all swept aside by the pressures to achieve quarterly and annual sales and profit targets. Executives’ bonuses are tied to achieving these performance metrics, and their stock grants and options deliver additional riches when the company’s stock appreciates. The pressures to serve the shareholder have only intensified in the past decade as the health care industry has become a sought-after vehicle for investors for the safe and steady and stellar returns it offers. Pharmaceuticals’ net profit margins are in the range of 15 to 20 percent, compared to 4 to 9 percent for large non-drug companies. A single successful drug can generate billions of dollars in sales, some as much as $15 billion or more annually. Many of our single pills, if incorporated into a company, would rank among the Fortune 500 companies. Investors bet on our drugs long before they reach the market. They pore over scientific papers and decipher results of early-stage clinical trials of a drug with the zeal of a geologist prospecting for oil. They swarm medical and scientific conferences where the latest findings and opinions about a drug’s progress are presented. Living up to their expectations or, better yet, exceeding them becomes a high priority for companies setting their future financial performance targets. The patient is nowhere in the picture; few in executive suites agonize over whether to lower a price by 10 or 15 percent so many more patients can afford the drug. The concept of affordability is not an operational imperative in the business, largely because top executives rarely interact with customers — the patients — to be sensitized to their needs, their plight really. In the car and smartphone industries, senior executives go around shaking hands with their customers and host regular conventions to take the pulse of their customers’ desires. In pharmaceuticals, a typical CEO’s calendar is filled with meetings with Wall Street analysts and fund managers, and the job of interacting with the customer is left to prescribing physicians, whom sales reps regularly badger with sales pitches. But these prescribers we rely on to do our bidding with patients have lost public trust. The opioid crisis exposed a large number of doctors accepting bribes, as much as $100,000 a year, and sexual services to push sales. Although this is the most publicized example of corruption among doctors, there are many others that haven’t drawn much public attention. Nearly all Big Pharma companies have paid fines, some multiple times, to settle charges of bribing doctors. In 2013, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay more than $2.2 billion in fines to settle charges that it had improperly promoted an antipsychotic drug; the government alleged that the company had paid “speaker fees to doctors to influence them to write prescriptions” and that its sales representatives “told these doctors that if they wanted to receive payments for speaking, they needed to increase” their prescriptions of the drug. In China, the world’s second-largest economy and the fastest-growing pharma market, the British drugmaker GSK paid a $499 million fine in 2014, and several top executives pleaded guilty for bribing doctors to promote company products; it was a headline-grabbing government investigation that revealed humiliating details about how the company used hundreds of travel agencies to entertain doctors in exotic places and to dispense cash to them and tried to influence regulatory authorities. Other big-name multinational pharma companies — including Novartis, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Pfizer — have also been snared in bribery investigations in China, and have paid fines. While these unethical practices in China, the world’s second-largest pharmaceutical market, have grabbed headlines, they go unnoticed in Asia and Africa. In the pharmaceutical industry, influence peddling goes much deeper, to the very core of its business — the research and development — unlike in any other industry. Companies recruit leading researchers and academics to guide them during drug development, and to publicly pronounce their expert opinions in medical journals once the drug is successfully launched to the public. As critical as this alliance is to the successful development of a drug, it is now widely questioned because of these influencers’ financial ties to pharmaceutical companies. ProPublica, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, has exposed several leading researchers and academics for accepting money from pharmaceutical companies which they didn’t disclose — or did so falsely — in connection with the scientific articles they published, some in prestigious journals like the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. Among the prominent researchers ProPublica cited was the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the nation’s leading cancer institute; he bullishly pitched to the investment community a new cancer treatment being developed by Roche without disclosing his financial ties to the company. What’s worthy of note is that this nationally respected cancer researcher didn’t seem to care that investors thought the product was a dud, a product that Roche would eventually scrap. The ethics of the scientist, who resigned in 2018, didn’t stand in the way of the company’s zeal for commercial success with the product. But then it is not unusual for a pharmaceutical company to influence, even shape, what the medical influencers present about its endeavors to investors and the public at large. Unfortunately, this dark underbelly of the industry is exposed only when an enterprise like ProPublica steps in with the full force of its investigative resources. There is little government oversight today to effectively block the bias in medical practice that results from the financial ties of medical practitioners with the pharmaceutical companies. But there is a website devoted to exposing and shaming both parties. If you want to find out if your doctor is receiving any money — how much and for what — from a company whose drug he or she is prescribing to you, you can go to the website Dollars for Docs and type in the name of the doctor. The site is the brainchild of ProPublica. It brings to mind the comparison with the U.S. Justice Department’s National Sex Offender Registry for the identity and location of known sex offenders. In a world where doctors and researchers and medical academics all work as an army of influencers, the patient exists only as the customer to be influenced. It is a most peculiar aspect of our industry that we market our products to doctors (who help generate sales for us but don’t pay for the products) and we sell to our actual customers, the patients (who pay but have no control over the price they pay). Who decides the price? A very small group of wholesalers called pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), owned by large insurers — CVS Health (which owns Aetna), Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthCare — that have been accused of padding their own profits at the cost of the patients they insure. These middlemen buy drugs on behalf of government and private employers and insurance companies. They negotiate prices with the pharma companies. It may sound bewildering that the customers who pay for the drugs cannot negotiate directly with the manufacturers, unlike in the rest of the world. Even Medicare, the country’s largest health plan, covering 60 million Americans, can’t. In effect, the market forces of supply and demand — the backbone of all other commerce in America — are shielded from each other by the opaque wall of the middlemen. Imagine if the price of your car or a smartphone were negotiated by a handful of middlemen and you had no choice but to pay. Today, 44 percent of Americans are either uninsured or underinsured; a 2021 national survey estimated that 46 million people couldn’t afford quality health care. Such news fails to register as profoundly worrisome in the psyches of pharmaceutical executives, largely because they are shielded from the customer by the systemic structure of the industry. Reports in the morning papers of patients unable to buy a lifesaving drug — like the news of Americans with diabetes struggling to procure high-priced insulin — might as well be the day’s weather report to them. Stories of struggles from further afield, like distant corners of Asia and Africa, where patients die because they can’t afford a blood pressure or cancer medicine, have even less of a chance of stirring the collective conscience of the industry. I am often asked if I think drug prices are high, in the sense that they are unreasonable and exploitative. I’ve had difficulty answering the question in the past with a definitive yes or no, because many of the drugs have had such a profound impact in banishing diseases and prolonging healthy life. Their discovery didn’t come easy. I would respond that the prices reflected the cost of innovation, but that they could be lower. That conditional justification is harder to make these days. More than 80 percent of the prescription drugs sold in the U.S. are generics, copies of patent-expired drugs. As copies, they have very low development costs. Their main costs lie in raw materials and manufacturing. And that cost is a fraction of the price the consumer currently pays for generics. I should know, because I manufacture many of them. For instance, a box of 30 five-milligram tablets of amlodipine, one of the most prescribed blood pressure medications, costs less than 30 cents to manufacture, and retails for $7 to $8.90 online and in U.S. drugstores, ostensibly discounted from $20 to $30. Simvastatin, a commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering medication, costs less than 40 cents for a pack of 30 20-mg tablets; it sells at $7.87 to $22.28, discounted from $12 to $30. Even after adding the cost of marketing and distribution, the selling prices of these drugs are astronomical. The consulting firm Pharmacy Benefit Consultants, which provides prescription coverage services to private and government employers, says the average wholesale prices — before the drug is sold to the patient — have been rising at “shocking rates.” Between the beginning of 2017 and March of 2018, it reports, the average wholesale prices of 450 drugs increased by between 25 and 100 percent. They included sharp increases for branded drugs that lost patents many years ago, such as 19.8 to 31 percent for Zoloft, which lost its patent in 2006, and 31.1 percent for Lipitor, which lost its patent in 2011. IT IS TIME FOR US to step up and make ourselves accountable to our customers, or else it will inevitably be done for us, as President Joe Biden did by capping the cost of insulin for seniors last year. Or maybe Mr. Trump will dangle a CEO by the collar in front of a national audience and humiliate him and demand admission of guilt and price cuts. Meanwhile, many government actions are in the works to limit prices of drugs across the board. And more than two dozen states have filed legal actions against pharmaceutical companies to force them to disclose how they price their products. Unfortunately, the industry today lacks leaders who can respond to these threats by spearheading a systemic change in the business practices that have brought on such public wrath. The industry has not produced in recent history a single business leader with the acumen — let alone the vision — to strategically pursue profit without abandoning the concurrent obligation to serve the patient. A bottom-line focus leads to appointing an accountant at the helm, or a lawyer if the company is mired in legal challenges, or a scientist simply because the company lacks a robust product line. There is nothing wrong with such choices if the chosen leader can strategically manage the twin missions of a health care company: ensuring that most patients can buy the drug while pursuing profit to enable research for the next big cure. Alas, none has emerged we can hold up as an example. That is pathetic. Because the genesis of the modern pharma industry is anchored on the idea of delivering medicine at affordable costs. Inventors of insulin and antibiotics — the two most seminal discoveries in pharmaceuticals — refused to patent their inventions so everyone would have access to these lifesaving drugs at low costs. That mission seems not to have inspired the modern-day leaders in the slightest. There is no Henry Ford, Walter Chrysler, William Durant, Thomas Watson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, or Elon Musk in the pharma industry. Pharmaceutical company boards are stacked with renowned business leaders from other industries and leading academics and Nobel laureates, but it is not discernible to me what worldly difference these outsiders have made to the conduct of the industry, which year after year has come under attack from its own customers and whose rage is now boiling over. What might a visionary do if one were to burst onto the scene today? One can imagine a Michael Dell mass-producing drugs — like he did with his Dell computer — and selling them at reasonable prices and yet making a stellar profit by reaching a large number of customers. Henry Ford did that with the Model T; he didn’t lie awake thinking of how to make it exclusive; he pioneered mass production as a way of maximizing profit by reaching the greatest number of customers possible. Perhaps a visionary would create a low-cost, no-frills brand of the expensive patented drug — like Herb Keller’s low-budget airline — without compromising on efficacy and safety. A Jeff Bezos would recast the industry by tossing out the middlemen and corruptible medical professionals. A pioneer would slash prices of some of the newest lifesaving biologic drugs — cutting-edge medicines for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis — to make them affordable, and would have the savviness to negotiate with the government an extended period of patent protection. Perhaps a visionary would model himself or herself after Warren Buffett and invite thousands of those who buy the company’s products to a gathering and mingle with them over barbecue and the strumming of a banjo to celebrate life and inspire the company with the grateful voices of the customers. That would make the Pharma Man proud. We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Rolling Stone, LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: 5 Explosive Dividend Growers To Put On Your Radar In 2025

Investment strategy: searching and locating money with a radar. These five stocks may deliver big dividend raises. I’m talking potential payout hikes starting at 20%. It’s possible that one of these firms doubles their dividend because, heck, they did that one year ago! How do I know? Gaudy dividend growth numbers are especially attractive because they often lead to big price gains. I call this dynamic the “dividend magnet.” The “magnet” effect is pretty straightforward: When a company not only grows its profits, but shares gobs of those earnings with stockholders as dividends, investors on the outside see both a sign of quality and the potential for income and buy in—driving the stock price higher for us! Chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) is a perfect example of this dividend magnet in action. Since its 2016 merger with Avago, Broadcom’s yield has spent most of its time below 4%, sometimes as low as 1%. Investors seeking high current yield alone would never have given AVGO a second look. But investors who saw the company’s dividend-growth potential dialed in bigtime profits! Investors who bought AVGO shares shortly after Broadcom and Avago merged, then held on through today, are currently collecting a wild 18% yield. If the headline dividend puts investors to sleep, consider the velocity of the payout. It’s possible a big raise—and subsequent price pop—is on the way. In the spirit of the dividend magnet, let’s discuss five companies that are due to deliver dividend hikes in the upcoming weeks. Recently these shareholder-friendly firms have gifted investors with generous raises between 20% and 178%. If history is ready to repeat, or at least rhyme, then let’s be ready. I love big hikes after years of stagnant payouts. A sudden dividend boost can reflect a sea change, whether that’s through organic growth or a sudden business add-on. Hence my interest in seeing that ADT Inc. (ADT), a provider of home and small-business security technology, announced in January 2024 that it would juice its payout by 57%—its first hike since initiating a dividend a couple months after its January 2018 IPO. ADT is in a curious situation. When Apollo spun the company off, ADT was saddled with nearly $10 billion in debt. The only meaningful cut it has made to that debt came in 2023, after ADT sold its commercial business to private equity for $1.6 billion. ADT’s debt now stands at $7.7 billion, which is still more than its $6.2 billion market cap. Interestingly, ADT’s resulting dividend action wasn’t a special dividend—a common move after a big sale—but a significant raise to its regular distribution. What ADT does next will be telling. Its payout ratio is an uber-safe 30%. And after operating in the red for most of its publicly traded life, ADT has strung together two years of positive earnings, and it’s expected to finish 2024 with a 43% pop in adjusted profits after shutting down its lagging solar division. But the company still has a pile of IOUs to whittle away, which could limit its dividend aggression. The first period to watch is late January—that’s when ADT announced its big hike last year. But historically, ADT announces dividends in late February or early March, alongside its Q4 and full-year earnings report. Scorpio Tankers (STNG) is a seaborne transportation company specializing in the shipping of crude oil and refined petroleum products. It currently boasts 102 vessels, including 14 Handymax vessels (35,000 and 48,000 deadweight tons), 49 Medium Range vessels (40,000 to 55,000 DWT) and 39 Long Range 2 vessels (105,000 to 115,000 DWT). Tanker and shipping stocks are among the most cyclical stocks we’ll ever come across, with operational results and stock prices as fickle as the sea. To wit, STNG has recorded net losses in five of the past 10 years—and it has still made about $900 million in profits during that time. That’s why most shipping stocks have extremely variable dividend programs. Which makes STNG’s more traditional regular dividend stand out. And that dividend has exploded, from 10 cents per share in February 2022, to 20 cents in February 2023, to 40 cents in February 2024. That’s two consecutive dividend doublers! But the reason I’m so interested in Scorpio’s February 2025 dividend announcement is a matter of timing. Scorpio started aggressively raising across 2023, first with the doubler to 20 cents, but then to 25 cents (May) and 35 cents (November). Scorpio’s February 2024 hike was “just” 14% from the prior quarter, and STNG has stayed put since then. In other words, the upcoming announcement could tell us whether Scorpio’s recent raises are more than a short-term flash in the pan. It certainly has room, at a payout ratio of less than 15% of 2024’s expected full-year earnings. Just be aware: Shareholders have been burned by Scorpio’s more rigid dividend program; the tanker firm slashed its dividend by 92% in 2017 in the midst of a multiyear downturn. Accounting for a 1-for-10 reverse split in 2019, the current distribution is only a third of what it was previously. Meritage Homes (MTH) is a mid-cap homebuilder that builds single-family attached and detached homes for first-time and first move-up buyers, primarily across the southern U.S., from California to the Carolinas. And like many homebuilders, it also provides mortgage, title, title insurance, and other housing-finance products to buyers of its homes. Regular readers will remember MTH in my 2024 roundup of new dividend programs. Meritage Homes came out of the gate swinging in early 2023, following both a big jump in profits for full-year 2022 and increased confidence that the Fed’s rate hikes would soon be coming to an end. (BofA says that for every 25 bps that the mortgage rate declines, as long as it’s under 7%, more than a million households are priced back into the housing market.) MTH’s profits declined in 2023, but it was still a strong year for the highly cyclical homebuilder, and in early 2024, it nearly tripled its dividend with a 178% boost to 75 cents per share quarterly. Of course, that distribution is now 37.5 cents per share by virtue of a 2-for-1 stock split at the start of 2025, which Meritage needed after a multiyear stock surge. That puts a massive target on Meritage’s next expected dividend announcement, which should come in mid-February. On the one hand, the pros see another respectable year from MTH, with profits climbing by mid-single digits, and MTH pays out less than 15% of profits as it is. On the other hand, a conservative hike (or no raise at all!) could signal anxiety over 2025’s outlook. Despite multiple Fed rate cuts, 30-year mortgage rates have climbed back to nearly 7%, rekindling worries about home affordability. As a result, MTH’s value has plunged by 30% since peaking in September 2024. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI) is an energy equipment and services company that provides transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as oilfield services companies, in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Most notably, it provides mesh frac sand—a “proppant” that props open the fractures created in the hydraulic fracturing process. Atlas Energy is another recent public listing that had its IPO in March 2023, then announced its first dividend (as a publicly traded company, but its sixth overall) just a couple months later. A quick look at just its payouts would indicate a generally rising regular dividend, but the reality is something much different. What we’re looking for in early February is any further indication that AESI has plans to be a rare quarterly dividend raiser. It’s a tough test—the company’s expected to finish 2024 with a 33% drop in profits to $1.03 per share, which would put its dividend coverage around 93%. But profits are estimated to nearly double in the year after, putting its coverage at a much more comfortable 50%—if Atlas management is confident about continued growth, it could signal that with yet another quarterly hike within its fully fixed dividend program. Penske Automotive Group (PAG) is an international automobile retailer that operates dealerships not just in the U.S., but also the U.K., Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan. These dealerships cover just about every international brand under the sun. PAG Brands It also boasts a thriving commercial-truck retail business across North America, and it distributes and retails commercial vehicles, power systems, engines, and more across Australia and New Zealand. In addition to all that, it owns roughly 29% of Penske Transportation Solutions, a North American transportation services, logistics, and supply-chain management services provider. Penske has an almost uninterrupted run of quarterly dividend hikes going back more than a decade—PAG did suspend its payout for two quarters in 2020, but resumed payouts that same year at the same level, then just went right back to raising and raising and raising. Penske’s dividend finished 2024 at $1.19 per share. That’s nearly double the 63 cents it started at in 2023! In fact, PAG actually accelerated as the year went on—its Q4 dividend hike was the largest year-over-year improvement of 2024. And that’s despite a largely down year that should see profits finish about 16% lower before bouncing back a little in 2025. For now, Penske’s quarterly dividend announcements are must-watch events for dividend growth investors. The next one should come in mid-January.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/14/2025 5:39:51 AM PST by george76 The number of restaurants in the Emerald City could drop by up to 8% this year.. Seattle’s new $20 minimum wage for 2025 has caused a 6th restaurant to close since the new year. Pike Place Market bakery The Confectional closed on Sunday after 18 years in business. ... Owner Destiny Sund told KIRO News Radio, “I wanted my team to have a wonderful holiday season, so I didn’t mention to them that we would be closing until after New Year’s Day. So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Owner Destiny Sund told KIRO News Radio, “I wanted my team to have a wonderful holiday season, so I didn’t mention to them that we would be closing until after New Year’s Day. So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Full Content:
NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: NYSE:JPM) has revealed a series of executive role shifts following Daniel Pinto's decision to retire as President and Chief Operating Officer at the end of 2026. Pinto will step down from his current roles on June 30, 2025, and transition to Vice Chairman, where he will continue to advise CEO Jamie Dimon and other senior executives. Jennifer Piepszak, previously Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Commercial & Investment Bank (CIB), has been appointed as the new Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately. Piepszak will assume responsibility for Technology, Operations, Chief Administrative Office, Data & Analytics, Corporate Strategy, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. She will also oversee the firm's Global Corporate Centers in India and the Philippines. Doug Petno, formerly Co-head of Global Banking, is set to replace Piepszak as Co-CEO of the CIB, alongside Troy Rohrbaugh. John Simmons will step into Petno's previous position and join Filippo Gori as the new Co-head of Global Banking. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes will maintain their current roles as CEO of Consumer and Community Banking and CEO of Asset & Wealth Management, respectively. All Corporate functions will be jointly managed by Piepszak and Dimon. Jamie Dimon praised Pinto for his "exceptional job" and "outstanding stewardship" during his tenure, which spans over 40 years. Pinto expressed pride in the team and the company's achievements, committing to support JPMorgan Chase in the future. This executive reshuffle comes as the financial services firm continues to lead in various sectors, including investment banking and asset management. The company reported $4.2 trillion in assets and $346 billion in stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024, serving a broad spectrum of customers under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands. With a P/E ratio of 13.5 and impressive revenue growth of 13.9% over the last twelve months, JPM has demonstrated strong performance. InvestingPro analysis reveals 8 additional key insights about JPM's financial health and growth prospects, including its 14-year streak of dividend increases and strong analyst support, with 9 analysts recently revising earnings estimates upward. Get the complete picture with InvestingPro's comprehensive research report, available along with detailed financial metrics and expert analysis. The information is based on a press release statement from JPMorgan Chase & Co. In other recent news, JPMorgan Chase & Co. has seen several significant developments. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst David Konrad raised the price target for the bank to $257, citing higher net interest income and capital markets revenues. Meanwhile, Truist Securities initiated coverage of JPMorgan with a Hold rating, recognizing the bank's financial performance and robust balance sheet. Additionally, BofA Securities raised its price target for JPMorgan to $280, expecting a resurgence in net interest income growth due to anticipated higher interest rates. Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak upgraded JPMorgan's stock rating from Peer Perform to Outperform, emphasizing the bank's strength in the Universal Broker and Trust sector. In operational news, JPMorgan is reportedly preparing to end its hybrid work option and return to full-time office work. This move indicates the bank's belief in the effectiveness of in-person work. In legal matters, JPMorgan has been sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over alleged failure to protect consumers from fraud on the Zelle network. However, the bank has resolved its dispute with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., with both parties agreeing to drop their claims. Furthermore, Michele G. Buck, the CEO of The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), has been elected to JPMorgan's board of directors. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: The Trump stock market rally is fading fast

The S&P 500 is close to erasing all the gains it notched since Donald Trump’s election victory. As of market close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up just 0.92% since Nov. 5 — the day Trump clinched a second term in the White House and set off a stock market rally. S&P 500 futures were up 0.27% early Tuesday, pointing to a potential bounce back after sinking 0.77% so far in January. But if the index continues to close lower through Inauguration Day next Monday, it could represent the worst performance for the S&P 500 between Election Day and a presidential inauguration since 2009, when Barack Obama first took office during the Great Recession, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group reported by CNBC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also pared back its post-election gains in recent weeks, and is now only 0.18% higher than Nov. 5. That index is down 0.85% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still up 3.52% since Election Day, although it has also seen some moderation in returns. A slump in tech stocks on Monday, including Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), following new Biden administration rules governing the sale of AI chips, sent the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower. In 2025, the Nasdaq has also slumped 1.63%. Dow futures were up 115 points in pre-market trading Tuesday, while Nasdaq futures ticked up 0.33%. In the aftermath of the election, major U.S. indexes hit new records in a Trump-fueled market rally, with the Dow hitting 44,000 for the first time in its 128-year history and the S&P 500 crossing the 6,000 mark. Investors are also bracing for the start of fourth-quarter earnings, which will kick off Wednesday with major banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%), Citibank (C+7.07%), and Wells Fargo (WFC+6.92%). The December Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, is also set to be released Wednesday morning. Economic indicators will continue to have an outsized impact on trading as Wall Street prepares for fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Morning After: What to expect from Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event next week

Welcome back to the newsletter. We are changing things up, so expect to see at least two editions each week, with the occasional special edition. The newsletter will continue to live on Engadget.com too, but if you haven’t subscribed, you should do that. Next week, Samsung will reveal its next family of Galaxy phones. Not the foldables, no, but the traditional S series devices. Going on track record, we can expect to see three S25 devices: standard, Plus and Ultra. There’s unlikely to be a huge change to aesthetics, but we expect some subtle differences — rounded corners, flatter edges and (of course) thinner bezels. Inside, at least in the US, the S25 series will probably be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite, designed for on-device generative AI. The chip promises 45 percent faster single- and multi-core performance while using 27 percent less power than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, so it could improve battery life too. Some rumors suggest a Galaxy S25 Slim with a — you guessed it — slimmer design. It’s all very on trend. However, given the FCC certifications only appear to cover the usual trio of flagships, that device may not arrive until later in the year. (If at all.) Expect an awful lot of AI razzle-dazzle too. One rumor suggests the Galaxy S25 series will include “an AI Agent that provides personalized clothing suggestions and transport information,” even though Google and myriad third-party apps already fully service the latter. I’d put money on a laborious bragging segment from Samsung and its AI tricks — many of which will fall by the wayside. A request: Please steal the Pixel’s Add Me photo feature. We’ll be reporting live from Samsung’s first Unpacked event of 2025. Mark your calendar for January 22! — Mat Smith Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

In his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will be roughly 2 millimeters thinner than any other phone model. “It will have a base-level A19 chip and a single-lens camera system,” Gurman notes, and will serve “as a testing ground for future technologies.” A single-lens camera could be an intriguing decision now three sensors is the standard for Apple’s most premium phones. Now, how about a MacBook mini? Continue reading. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is leaving the company after last year’s disastrous app launch, in which its redesign was missing core features. Back in May 2024, the company rolled out a mobile app rife with bugs and missing features like alarms and sleep timers. Some customers even complained that entire speaker systems would no longer work after updating to the new app. Sonos’ stock price has fallen by around 13 percent since the app launched. Sonos laid off over 100 people in August as it tried to fix the software and revenue fell 16 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on September 28. Spence’s payout package includes $7,500 per month until June, a cash severance of $1.9 million and shares in Sonos. I aspire to screw up an app update. Continue reading. Meta appeared to block links to Pixelfed, a decentralized photo-sharing platform, on Facebook, according to users on both Bluesky and 404 Media. A small group of posts that linked to pixelfed.social was deleted, with Facebook’s Community Standards on spam used as a justification. There’s a bigger impetus for users to jettison Instagram: Meta just announced dramatic changes to how it plans to moderate speech on its platforms. The company is ending both its third-party fact-checking program and made changes to its Hateful Conduct policy last week. A Meta spokesperson said removing the posts to Pixelfed was a mistake, and they’d be reinstated. Continue reading.

LFGY Equity Portfolio LFGY seeks capital appreciation via direct investments in its portfolio of 15-30 Crypto companies. To enable LFGY to effectively implement its options strategies (see below), LFGY’s Adviser evaluates the liquidity of a potential company’s common stock and the liquidity of its options contracts. Any dividend paid by its Crypto companies will contribute to LFGY’s income generation. LFGY Options Portfolio LFGY seeks to generate current income primarily by writing (selling) options contracts on some or all of its Crypto companies. Depending on the Adviser’s outlook, it will select one or more options strategies that it believes will best provide LFGY with current income while generally also attempting to participate in a portion of the share price increases experienced by its Crypto companies. Further, depending on the Adviser’s assessment of one or more of the Crypto companies’ options contracts (e.g., they are insufficiently liquid or too costly), LFGY may employ options strategies on a Crypto ETF. By strategically entering and exiting options positions, the Adviser seeks to enhance LFGY's income potential. LFGY Distribution Schedule LFGY is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, LFGY aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, LFGY aims to make distributions on a weekly basis and its first weekly distribution is expected to be announced on January 22, 2025. Why Invest in LFGY? Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. 1 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 2 The Distribution per Share is the most recent such amount as of close on January 13, 2025. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund’s objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

What O'Reilly Learning Platform Usage Tells Us About Where the Industry Is Headed Welcome to our annual report on the usage of the OâReilly learning platform. Itâs been an exciting year, dominated by a constant stream of breakthroughs and announcements in AI, and complicated by industry-wide layoffs. Generative AI gets better and betterâbut that trend may be at an end. Now the ball is in the application developersâ court: Where, when, and how will AI be integrated into the applications we build and use every day? And if AI replaces the developers, who will be left to do the integration? Our data shows how our users are reacting to changes in the industry: Which skills do they need to brush up on? Which do they need to add? What do they need to know to do their day-to-day work? In short: Where have we been in the past year, and where are we going? We arenât concerned about AI taking away software developersâ jobs. Ever since the computer industry got started in the 1950s, software developers have built tools to help them write software. AI is just another tool, another link added to the end of that chain. Software developers are excited by tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other coding assistants that make them more productive. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. Thatâs only one of the stories weâre following. Here are a few of the others: All of these trends have been impacted, if not driven, by AIâand that impact will continue in the coming year. Finally, some notes about methodology. Skip this paragraph if you want; we donât mind. This report is based on the use of OâReillyâs online learning platform from January 1, 2024, to September 30, 2024. Year-over-year comparisons are based on the same period in 2023. The data in each graph is based on OâReillyâs âunits viewedâ metric, which measures the actual use of each item on the platform. It accounts for different usage behavior for different media: text, courses, and quizzes. In each graph, the data is scaled so that the item with the greatest units viewed is 1. That means items within a graph are comparable to each other, but you canât compare an item in one graph to an item in another. And all percentages are reported with two significant digits. When we look at how our customers use the OâReilly learning platform, we always think in terms of skills. What skills are they trying to gain? And how are they trying to improve their knowledge? This year, one thread that we see across all of our platform is the importance of artificial intelligence. Itâs all about upskilling in the age of AI. It will surprise absolutely nobody that AI was the most active category in the past year. For the past two years, large models have dominated the news. That trend started with ChatGPT and its descendants, most recently GPT 4o1. But unlike 2022, when ChatGPT was the only show anyone cared about, we now have many contenders. Claude has emerged as a favorite among programmers. After a shaky start, Googleâs Gemini models have become solid performers. Llama has established itself as one of the top models and as the matriarch of a rich ecosystem of open1 models. Many of the open models can deliver acceptable performance when running on laptops and phones; some are even targeted at embedded devices. So what does our data show? First, interest in almost all of the top skills is up: From 2023 to 2024, Machine Learning grew 9.2%; Artificial Intelligence grew 190%; Natural Language Processing grew 39%; Generative AI grew 289%; AI Principles grew 386%; and Prompt Engineering grew 456%. Among the top topics, the most significant decline was for GPT itself, which dropped by 13%ânot a huge decline but certainly a significant one. Searches for GPT peaked in March 2023 and have been trending downward ever since, so our search data matches our usage data. Weâre used to seeing interest move from a more general high-level topic to specific skills as an industry sector matures, so this trend away from GPT in favor of more abstract, high-level topics is counterintuitive. But in context, itâs fairly clear what happened. For all practical purposes, GPT was the only game in town back in 2023. The situation is different now: Thereâs lots of competition. These other models donât yet show up significantly in search or usage data, but the users of our platform have figured out whatâs important: not learning about GPT or Claude or Gemini or Mistral but getting the background you need to make sense of any model. Discovering a workflow that fits your needs is important, and as Simon Willison points out, your ideal workflow may actually involve using several models. Recent models are all good, but they arenât all good in the same way. AI has had a great year, but will it continue to show gains in 2025? Or will it drop back, much as ChatGPT and GPT did? That depends on many factors. Gartner has generative AI slipping into the âtrough of disillusionmentââand whatever you think of the technologyâs promise, remember that the disillusionment is a sociological phenomenon, not a technical one, and that it happens because new technologies are overhyped. Regardless of generative AIâs long-term promise, we expect some disillusionment to set in, especially among those who havenât properly understood the technology or its capabilities. Prompt Engineering, which gained 456% from 2023 to 2024, stands out. A 456% gain isnât as surprising as it seems; after all, people only started talking about prompt engineering in 2023. Although âprompt engineeringâ was bandied about as a buzzword, it didnât become a skill that employers were looking for until late in 2023, if that. That may be an early warning signal for AI disillusionment. Searches for âprompt engineeringâ grew sharply in 2023 but appeared to decline slightly in 2024. Is that noise or signal? If disillusionment in Prompt Engineering sets in, weâll also see declines in higher-level topics like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Thereâs a different take on the future of prompt engineering. There have been a number of arguments that the need for prompt engineering is temporary. As generative AI improves, this line of reasoning contends, we will no longer need to write complex prompts that specify exactly what we want the AI to do and how to do it. Prompts will be less sensitive to exactly how theyâre worded; changing a word or two will no longer give a completely different result. Weâll no longer have to say âexplain it to me as if I were five years oldâ or provide several examples of how to solve a problem step-by-step. Some recent developments point in that direction. Several of the more advanced models have made the âexplain it to meâ prompts superfluous. OpenAIâs GPT 4o1 has been trained in a way that maximizes its problem-solving abilities, not just its ability to string together coherent words. At its best, it eliminates the need to write prompts that demonstrate how to solve the problem (a technique called few-shot prompting). At worst, it âdecidesâ on an inappropriate process, and itâs difficult to convince it to solve the problem a different way. Anthropicâs Claude has a new (beta) computer use feature that lets the model use browsers, shells, and other programs: It can click on links and buttons, select text, and do much more. (Google and OpenAI are reportedly working on similar features.) Enabling a model to use the computer in much the same way as a human appears to give it the ability to solve multistep problems on its own, with minimal description. Itâs a big step toward a future full of intelligent agents: linked AI systems that cooperate to solve complex problems. However, Anthropicâs documentation is full of warnings about serious security vulnerabilities that remain to be solved. Weâre thrilled that Anthropic has been forthright about these weaknesses. But still, while computer use may be a peek at the future, itâs not ready for prime time. AI will almost certainly slide into a trough of disillusionment; as Iâve said, the trough has more to do with sociology than with technology. But OpenAI and Anthropic are demonstrating important paths forward. Will these experiments bear fruit in the next year? Weâll see. Many skills associated with AI also showed solid gains. Use of content about Deep Learning is up 14%, Generative Models is up 26%, and GitHub Copilot is up 471%. Use of content about the major AI libraries was up slightly: PyTorch gained 6.9%, Keras increased 3.3%, and Scikit-Learn gained 1.7%. Usage of TensorFlow content declined 28%; its continued decline indicates that PyTorch has won the hearts and minds of AI developers. These gainsâparticularly Copilotâsâare impressive, but a more important story concerns two skills that came out of nowhere: Usage of content about LangChain is on a par with PyTorch, and RAG is on a par with Keras. Neither of these skills were in last yearâs report; in 2023, content usage for LangChain and RAG was minimal, largely because little content existed. Theyâve caught on because both LangChain and RAG are tools for building better applications on top of AI models. GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama arenât the end of the road. RAG lets you build applications that send private data to a model as part of the prompt, enabling the model to build answers from data that wasnât in its training set. This process has several important consequences: It minimizes the probability of error or âhallucinationâ; it makes it possible to attribute answers to the sources from which they came; and it often makes it possible to use a much smaller and more economical model. LangChain is the first of many frameworks for building AI agents. (OpenAI has Swarm; Google has an Agent Builder thatâs part of Vertex; Salesforce and other vendors also have offerings.) Agents are software that can plan and execute multistage actions, many of which are delegated to other AI models. Claudeâs computer use API is another facet of this trend, along with whatever products OpenAI and Google may be building. Saying that usage has increased 26 million percent isnât to the pointâbut realizing that LangChain has grown from near zero to a platform on a par with PyTorch is very much so. Agentic applications are certainly the next big trend within AI. Artificial intelligence relies heavily on what we used to call (and perhaps still call) data science. Building AI models requires data at unprecedented scale. Building applications with RAG requires a portfolio of data (company financials, customer data, data purchased from other sources) that can be used to build queries, and data scientists know how to work with data at scale. Therefore, itâs not surprising that Data Engineering skills showed a solid 29% increase from 2023 to 2024. SQL, the common language of all database work, is up 3.2%; Power BI was up 3.0%, along with the more general (and much smaller) topic Business Intelligence (up 5.0%). PostgreSQL is close to edging ahead of MySQL, with a 3.6% gain. Interest in Data Lake architectures rose 59%, while the much older Data Warehouse held steady, with a 0.3% decline. (In our skill taxonomy, Data Lake includes Data Lakehouse, a data storage architecture that combines features of data lakes and data warehouses.) Finally, ETL grew 102%. With the exception of ETL, the gains are smaller than the increases we saw for AI skills, but that makes sense: AI is an exciting new area, and data is a mature, stable category. The number of people who need specialized skills like ETL is relatively small but obviously growing as data storage becomes even more important with AI. Itâs worth understanding the connection between data engineering, data lakes, and data lakehouses. Data engineers build the infrastructure to collect, store, and analyze data. The data needed for an AI application almost always takes many forms: free-form text, images, audio, structured data (for example, financial statements), etc. Data often arrives in streams, asynchronously and more or less constantly. This is a good match for a data lake, which stores data regardless of structure for use later. Because data receives only minimal processing when it arrives, it can be stored in near real time; itâs cleaned and formatted in application-specific ways when itâs needed. Once data has been stored in a data lake, it can be used for traditional business analytics, stored in a vector or graph database for RAG, or put to almost any other use. A data lakehouse combines both structured and unstructured data in a single platform. What do software developers do all day? They write software. Programming is an important part of the job, but itâs not the whole thing; best estimates are that programmers spend roughly 20% of their time writing code. The rest of their time is spent understanding the problems theyâre being asked to solve, designing appropriate solutions, documenting their work, updating management on the status of their projects, and much more. Software architecture, which focuses on understanding a customerâs requirements and designing systems to meet those requirements, is an important part of the overall software development picture. Itâs a skill to which many of our software developers and programmers aspire. This yearâs data shows that software architecture continues to be one of the most desirable skills in the industries we serve. Usage of material about Software Architecture rose 5.5% from 2023 to 2024, a small but significant increase. But itâs more important to ask why it increased. A position in software architecture may be perceived as more secure in a time of layoffs, and itâs often perceived as another step forward in a career that moves from junior programmer to senior to lead. In addition, the rise of AI presents many architectural challenges: Do we try to build our own model? (The answer is usually âno.â) Should we use an AI service provider like OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, or Google, or should we fine-tune and host our own model on our own infrastructure? How do we build applications that are safe (and how do we define âsafeâ)? How do we evaluate performance? These questions all have a bearing on software architecture. Furthermore, AI might provide tools to help software architects, but so far, these tools can do little for the substance of the job: understanding customersâ needs and helping them define what they want to build. With AI in the picture, weâre all building new kinds of applicationsâand those applications require architects to help design them. In this context, itâs no surprise that Enterprise Architecture is up 17% and Distributed Systems is up 35%. Enterprise architecture is a staple: As Willie Sutton said about banks, âThatâs where the money is.â Itâs a good bet that many enterprises are trying to integrate AI into their systems or update legacy systems that are no longer scalable or maintainable. We can (and do) make the same argument about distributed systems. Modern enterprises work on a scale that was unimaginable a few decades ago. Scale isnât just for companies like Amazon and Google. To survive, even small businesses need to develop an online presenceâand that means building systems in the cloud that can handle surges in demand gracefully. It means building systems that can withstand outages. Distributed systems arenât just massive deployments with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Your business may only require a dozen nodes, but regardless of the scale, it still faces the architectural challenges that come with distributed systems. Some of the more significant ideas from the past decade seem to be falling out of favor. Microservices declined 24%, though content use is still substantial. Domain-Driven Design, which is an excellent skill for designing with microservices, is down 22%. Serverless is down 5%; this particular architectural style was widely hyped and seemed like a good match for microservices but never really caught on, at least based on our platformâs data. Whatâs happening? Microservice architectures are difficult to design and implement, and they arenât always appropriateâfrom the start, the best advice has been to begin by building a monolith, then break the monolith into microservices when it becomes unwieldy. By the time you reach that stage, youâll have a better feel for what microservices need to be broken out from the monolith. Thatâs good advice, but the hype got ahead of it. Many organizations that would never need the complexity of microservices were trying to implement them with underskilled staff. As an architectural style, microservices wonât disappear, but theyâre no longer getting the attention they once were. And new ideas, like modular monoliths, may catch on in the coming years; modularity is a virtue regardless of scale or complexity. Last yearâs report showed that our users were consuming less content about programming languages. This yearâs data continues that trend. We see a small drop for Python (5.3%) and a more significant drop for Java (13%). And even C++, which showed healthy growth from 2022 to 2023, is down 9% in 2024. On the other hand, C is up (1.3%), and so is C# (2.1%). Rust is up 9.6%. The small increases in C and C# may just be noise. C is well-entrenched and isnât going anywhere fast. Neither is C++, despite its drop. Rustâs increase continues a growth trend that stretches back several years; thatâs an important signal. Rust is clearly winning over developers, at least for new projects. Now that the US government is placing a priority on memory safety, Rustâs emphasis on memory safety serves it well. Rust isnât the first programming language to claim memory safety, nor will it be the last. (There are projects to add memory safety to C++, for example.) But right now, itâs the best positioned. Aside from Rust, though, we need to ask whatâs happening with programming skills. A few forces are applying downward pressure. Industry-wide layoffs may be playing a role. Weâve downplayed the effect of layoffs in the past, but we may have to admit that we were wrong: This year, they may be taking a bite out of skills development. Could generative AI have had an effect on the development of programming language skills? Itâs possible; shortly after GPT-3 was released, Simon Willison reported that he was learning Rust with the help of ChatGPT and Copilot, and more recently that heâs used Claude to write Rust code that he has in production, even though he doesnât consider himself a skilled Rust developer. It would be foolish to deny that generative AI will help programmers to become more productive. And it would be foolish to deny that AI will change how and what we learn. But we have to think carefully about what âlearningâ means, and why we learn in the first place. Programmers wonât have to remember all the little details of programming languagesâbut thatâs never been the important part of programming, nor has rote memorization been an important part of learning. Students will never have to remember a half dozen sorting algorithms, but computer science classes donât teach sorting algorithms because committing algorithms to memory is important. Every programming language has a sort() function somewhere in its libraries. No, sorting is taught because itâs a problem that everyone can understand and that can be solved in several different waysâand each solution has different properties (performance, memory use, etc.). The point is learning how to solve problems and understanding the properties of those solutions. As Claire Vo said in her episode of Generative AI in the Real World, weâll always need engineers who think like engineersâand thatâs what learning how to solve problems means. Whether lines end in a semicolon or a colon or whether you use curly braces, end statements, or tabs to delimit blocks of code is immaterial. The perception that generative AI minimizes the need to learn programming languages may limit the use of language-oriented content on our platform. Does that benefit the learners? If someone is using AI to avoid learning the hard conceptsâlike solving a problem by dividing it into smaller pieces (like quicksort)âthey are shortchanging themselves. Shortcuts rarely pay off in the long term; coding assistants may help you to write some useful code, but those who use them merely as shortcuts rather than as learning tools are missing the point. Unfortunately, the history of teachingâgoing back centuries if not millenniaâhas stressed memorization. Itâs time for both learners and teachers to grow beyond that. Learning is changing as a result of AI. The way we teach, and the way our users want to be taught, is changing. Building the right kind of experiences to facilitate learning in an AI-enabled environment is an ongoing project for our learning platform. In the future, will our users learn to program by completing AI-generated tutorials that are customized in real time to their needs and abilities? Thatâs where weâre headed. Use of content about web programming skills is down, with few exceptions. A number of factors might be contributing to this. First, I canât think of any significant new web frameworks in the past year; the field is still dominated by React (down 18%) and Angular (down 10%). There is some life near the bottom of the chart. The Svelte framework had significant growth (24%); so did Next.js (8.7%). But while these frameworks have their adherents, theyâre far from dominant. PHP (down 19%) still claims to have built the lionâs share of the web, but itâs not what developers reach for when they want to build something new, particularly if that ânewâ is a complex web application. The PHP world has been rocked by a bitter fight between the CEOs of Automattic (the developers of WordPress, by far the most important PHP framework) and WP Engine (a WordPress hosting platform). That fight started too late to affect this yearâs results significantly, but it might weigh heavily next year. A more significant development has been the movement away from complex platforms and back toward the simplicity of the earlier web. Alex Russellâs âReckoningâ posts summarize many of the problems. Our networks and our computers are much, much faster than they were 20 or 25 years ago, but web performance hasnât improved noticeably. If anything, itâs gotten worse. We still wait for applications to load. Applications are hard to develop and have gotten harder over the years. There are several new frameworks that may (or may not) be lighter-weight, such as HTMX, Ludic, Glitch, and Cobalt. None of them have yet made a dent in our data, in part because none have built enough of a following for publishers and trainers to develop contentâand you canât have any units viewed if there isnât anything to view. However, if you want an experience that isnât dominated by heavyweight frameworks, doesnât require you to become a JavaScript expert, and puts the fun back into building the web, this is where to look. Web dev is a discipline that has been ill-served by shortcuts to learning. We hear too often about boot camp graduates who know a few React tricks but donât understand the difference between React and JavaScript (or even know that JavaScript exists, let alone other programming languages). These programmers are very likely to lose their jobs to AI, which can already reproduce all the basic React techniques theyâve learned. Learning providers need to think about how AI is changing the workplace and how their students can partner with AI to build something beyond what AI can build on its own. Part of the solution is certainly a return to basics, ensuring that junior developers understand the tools with which theyâre working. Operations is another area where the trends are mostly downward. It may be small consolation, but the drops for several of the most important topics are relatively small: Linux is down 1.6%, Terraform is down 4.0%, and Infrastructure as Code is down 7.3%. As a skill, Terraform seems little hurt by the fork of Terraform that created the open source OpenTofu project, perhaps because the OpenTofu developers have been careful to maintain compatibility with Terraform. How this split plays out in the future is an open question. Itâs worth noting the precipitous drop in Terraform certification (down 43%); that may be a more important signal than Terraform itself. Kubernetes is down 20%. Despite that drop, which is sharper than last yearâs 6.9% decrease, content teaching Kubernetes skills remains the second most widely used group in this category, and Kubernetes certification is up 6.3%. Last year, we said that Kubernetes needed to be simpler. It isnât. There are no viable alternatives to Kubernetes yet, but there are different ways to deploy it. Kubernetes as a service managed by a cloud provider is certainly catching on, putting the burden of understanding every detail of Kubernetesâs operation on the shoulders of the provider. We also pointed to the rise of developer platforms; this year, the buzzword is âplatform engineeringâ (Camille Fournier and Ian Nowlandâs book is excellent), but as far as Kubernetes is concerned, itâs the same thing. Platform engineers can abstract knowledge of Kubernetes into a platform, minimizing software developersâ cognitive overhead. The result is that the number of people who need to know about Kubernetes is smaller. Both DevOps (down 23%) and SRE (down 15%) dropped. Thereâs certainly some frustration with DevOps: Has it paid off? We ask a different question: Has it ever been tried? One problem with DevOps (which it shares with Agile) is that many companies âadoptedâ it in name but not in essence. They renamed a few positions, hired a few DevOps engineers, maybe created a DevOps group, never realizing that DevOps wasnât about new job titles or new specialties; it was about reducing the friction between software development teams and operations teams. When you look at it this way, creating new groups and hiring new specialists can only be counterproductive. And the result is predictable: You donât have to look far to find blogs and whitepapers claiming that DevOps doesnât work. Thereâs also frustration with ideas like âshift leftâ and DevSecOps, which envision taking security into account from the start of the development process. Security is a different discussion, but itâs unclear how you build secure systems without taking it into account from the start. Weâve spent several decades building software and trying to fold security in at the last minuteâwe know how well that works. In any case, the industry has moved on. Platform engineering is, in many ways, a natural outgrowth of both DevOps and SRE. As Iâve argued, the course of operations has been to increase the ratio of computers to operators. Is platform engineering the next step, allowing software developers to build systems that can handle their own deployment and routine operations without the help of operations staff? General IT certifications, apart from security, trended downward. Use of content to prepare for the CompTIA A+ exam, an entry-level IT certification, was down 15%; CompTIA Network+ was down 7.9%. CompTIAâs Linux+ exam held its own, with a decline of 0.3%. On our platform, weâve seen that Linux resources are in high demand. The slight decline for Linux-related content (1.6%) fits with the very small decrease in Linux+ certification. For many years, Ciscoâs certifications have been the gold standard for IT. Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), a fairly general entry-level IT certification, showed the greatest usage and the smallest decline (2.2%). Usage of content to prepare for the Cisco Certified Network Practitioner (CCNP) exams, a cluster of related certifications on topics like enterprise networking, data centers, and security, dropped 17%. The Cisco Certified Internet Engineer (CCIE) exams showed the greatest decline (36%). CCIE has long been recognized as the most comprehensive and in-depth IT certification. Weâre not surprised that the total usage of this content is relatively small. CCIE represents the climax of a career, not the start. The number of people who attain it is relatively small, and those who do often include their CCIE number with their credentials. But the drop is surprising. Itâs certainly true that IT is less focused on heavy-duty routing and switching for on-prem data centers (or even smaller machine rooms) than it was a few years ago. That work has largely been offloaded to cloud providers. While routers and switches havenât disappeared, IT doesnât need to support as wide a range of resources: They need to support office WiFi, some databases that need to remain on-premises, and maybe a few servers for office-related tasks. Theyâre very concerned about security, and as weâll see shortly, security certifications are thriving. Is it possible that Cisco and its certifications arenât as relevant as they used to be? As we mentioned above, we also saw a drop in the relatively new certification for HashiCorpâs Terraform (43%). Thatâs a sharp declineâparticularly since use of content about Terraform itself only declined 4.0%, showing that Terraform skills remain highly desirable regardless of the certification. A sudden drop in certification prep can be caused by a new exam, making older content out-of-date, but that isnât the case here. Terraform certification certainly wasnât helped by HashiCorpâs switch to a Business Source License or the subsequent fork of the Terraform project. IBMâs pending acquisition of Terraform (set to close before the end of 2024) may have introduced more uncertainty. Is the decline in interest for Terraform certification an indicator of dissatisfaction in the Terraform community? The Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA, up 6.3%) was a bright spot in IT certification. Whether or not Kubernetes is overly complex (perhaps because itâs overly complex) and whether or not companies are moving out of the cloud, KCNA certification is a worthwhile asset. Cloud native applications arenât going away. And whether theyâre managing Kubernetes complexity by building developer platforms, using a Kubernetes provider, or using some other solution, companies will need people on their staff who can demonstrate that they have Kubernetes skills. Content use for the major cloud providers and their certifications was down across all categories, with one exception: Use of content to prepare for Google Cloud certifications is up 2.2%. What does that tell us, if anything? Are we looking at a âcloud repatriationâ movement in full swing? Are our customers moving their operations back from the cloud to on-prem (or hosted) data centers? Last year, we said that we see very little evidence that repatriation is happening. This year? An article in The New Stack argues that cloud repatriation is gathering steam. While that might account for the decline in the use of cloud-related content, we still see little evidence that repatriation is actually happening. Two case studies (37signals and GEICO) donât make a trend. The ongoing expense of operating software in the cloud probably is greater than the cost of running it on-premises. But the cloud allows for scaling on demand, and thatâs important. Itâs true, few businesses have the sudden usage peaks that are driven by events like retailâs Black Friday. But the cloud providers arenât just about sudden 10x or 100x bursts of traffic; they also allow you to scale smoothly from 1x to 1.5x to 2x to 3x, and so on. It saves you from arguing that you need additional infrastructure until the need becomes a crisis, at which point, you donât need to grow 1.5x; you need 5x. After moving operations to the cloud and experiencing a few years of growthâeven if that growth is moderateâmoving back to an on-premises data center will require significant capital expense. It will probably require gutting all the infrastructure that you havenât been using for the past year and replacing it with something up-to-date. Does this mean that cloud providers are âroach motels,â where you can move in but you canât move out? Thatâs not entirely untrue. But the ease of scaling by allocating a few more servers and seeing a slightly higher bill the next month canât be ignored, even if those slightly higher bills sound like the proverbial story of boiling the frog. Evaluating vendors, waiting for delivery, installing hardware, configuring hardware, testing hardwareâthatâs effort and expense that businesses are offloading to cloud vendors. The ability to scale fluidly is particularly important in the age of AI. Few companies have the skills needed to build on-premises infrastructure for AI, with its cooling and power requirements. That means either buying AI services directly from cloud providers or building infrastructure to host your own models. And of course, the cloud providers have plenty of help for companies that need to use their high-end GPUs. (Seriouslyâif you want to host your AI application on-premises, see how long it will take to get delivery of NVIDIAâs latest GPU.) The reality, as IDC concluded in a survey of cloud use, is that âworkload repatriation from public cloud into dedicated environments goes hand in hand with workload migration to public cloud activities, reflecting organizationsâ continuous reassessment of IT environments best suited for serving their workloads.â That is, thereâs a constant ebb and flow of workloads to and from public clouds as companies adapt their strategies to the business environment. The buzzword power of âthe cloudâ lasted longer than anyone could reasonably have expected, but itâs dead now. However, thatâs just the buzzword. Companies may no longer be âmoving to the cloudâ; that move has already happened, and their staff no longer need to learn how to do it. Organizations now need to learn how to manage the investments theyâve made. They need to learn which workloads are most appropriate for the cloud and which are better run on-premises. IT still needs staff with cloud skills. Security Governance drove the most content use in 2024, growing 7.3% in the process and overtaking Network Security (down 12%). The rise of governance is an important sign: âSecurityâ is no longer an ad hoc issue, fixing vulnerabilities in individual applications or specific services. That approach leads to endless firefighting and eventually failureâand those failures end up in the major news media and result in executives losing their jobs. Security is a company-wide issue that needs to be addressed in every part of the organization. Confirming the growing importance of security governance, interest in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) grew 44%, and Compliance grew 10%. Both are key parts of security governance. Security architecture also showed a small but significant increase (3.7%); designing a security architecture that works for an entire organization is an important part of looking at the overall security picture. The use of content about Application Security also grew significantly (17%). Thatâs a very general topic, and it perhaps doesnât say much except that our users are interested in securing their applicationsâwhich goes without saying. But what kinds of applications? All of them: web applications, cloud applications, business intelligence applications, everything. We get a bigger signal from the increase in Zero Trust (13%), a particularly important strategy for securing services in which every user, human or otherwise, must authenticate itself to every service that it uses. In addition, users must have appropriate privileges to do what they need to do, and no more. Itâs particularly important that zero trust extends authentication to nonhuman users (other computers and other services, whether internal or external). Itâs a response to the âhard, crunchy outside, but soft chewy insideâ security that dominated the 1990s and early 2000s. Zero trust assumes that attackers can get through firewalls, that they can guess passwords, and that they can compromise phones and computers when theyâre outside the firewall. Firewalls, good passwords, and multifactor authentication systems are all importantâtheyâre the hard, crunchy outside that prevents an attacker from getting in. Zero trust helps keep attackers outside, of courseâbut more than that, it limits the damage they can do once theyâre inside. Weâre puzzled by the drop in use of content about Network Security, which corresponds roughly to the drop in Cisco certifications. Network Security is still the second most widely used skill, but itâs down 12% from 2023 to 2024. Perhaps network security isnât deemed as important when employees wander in and out of company networks and applications are distributed between in-house servers and the cloud. We hope that our users arenât making that mistake. A bigger issue is that networks havenât changed much in the past few years: Weâre still using IPv4; weâre still using routers, switches, and firewalls, none of which have changed significantly in recent years. What has changed is the way security is implemented. Cloud computing and zero trust have moved the focus from big-iron networking devices to interactions between systems, regardless of how they are connected. Security certification has been one of the biggest growth areas on our platform. As Iâve said elsewhere, security professionals love their certifications. Thereâs a good reason for that. In most other specialties, itâs possible to build a portfolio of programs you wrote, systems you architected, sites youâve designed. What can a security person say in a job interview? âI stopped 10,000 people from logging in last year?â If youâve ever monitored a public-facing Linux system, you know that claim means little. Security is cursed with the problem that the best news is no news: âNothing bad happenedâ doesnât play well with management or future employers. Neither does âI kept all the software patched, and spent time reading CVEs to learn about new vulnerabilitiesââeven though thatâs an excellent demonstration of competence. Certification is a way of proving that you have certain skills and that youâve met some widely recognized standards. The CISSP (up 11%) and CompTIA Security+ (up 13%) certifications are always at the top of our lists, and this year is no exception. Our State of Security in 2024 report showed that CISSP was the certification most commonly required by employers. If thereâs a gold standard for security skills, CISSP is it: Itâs a thorough, comprehensive exam for people with more than five years of experience. CompTIA Security+ certification has always trailed CISSP slightly in our surveys and in platform performance, but its position in second place is uncontested. Security+ is an entry-level certification; itâs particularly desirable for people who are starting their security careers. Security certification was especially important for government users. For most industry sectors, usage focused on programming skills in Java or Python, followed by artificial intelligence. The government sector was a strong outlier. Security and IT certifications were by far the most important topics. CompTIA Security+ and CISSP (in that order) led. Moving beyond CISSP and Security+, many of the other security certifications also showed gains. Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) was up 1.4%, as was the less popular CompTIA PenTest+ certification (3.3%). Certified Cloud Security Professional was up 2.4%, somewhat less than weâd expect, given the importance of the cloud to modern IT, but itâs still a gain. ISACAâs Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) was up 45%, Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) grew 9.3%, and Certified Information Security Auditor (CISA) was up 8.8%; these three certifications are strongly associated with security governance. The most significant declines were for the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification (down 13%) and CCNA Security (down 55%). The drop in CCNA Security is extreme, but it isnât unexpected given that none of the Cisco certifications showed an increase this year. Weâre missing one important piece of the security certification puzzle. Thereâs no data on AI security certificationsâand thatâs because there arenât any. Software that incorporates AI must be built and operated securely. That will require security experts with AI expertise (and who can demonstrate that expertise via certifications). We expect (or maybe a better phrase is âwe hopeâ) that lack will be addressed in the coming year. Professional development continues to be an important growth area for our audience. The most important skill, Professional Communication, grew 4.5%ânot much but significant. We saw a 9.6% increase in users wanting to know more about Engineering Leadership, and a 21.5% increase in users using content about Personal Productivity. Project Management was almost unchanged from 2023 to 2024 (up 0.01%), while the use of content about the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification grew 15%. Interest in Product Management declined 11%; it seems to be a skill that our users are less interested in. Why? For the past few years, product manager has seemed to be a trendy new job title. But in last yearâs report, Product Management only showed a small gain from 2022 to 2023. Is interest in Product Management as a skill or as a job title fading? We also saw a 7.9% decline in Leadership (aside from Engineering Leadership), and a huge 35% decline for IT Management. Are we to blame these on the corporate layoff cycle? Thatâs possible, but itâs too easy. IT may be affected by a general trend toward simplification and platform engineering, as weâve discussed: A platform engineering group can do a lot to reduce cognitive overhead for developers, but it also reduces the need for IT staff. A platform engineering group doesnât have to be large; is the need for IT staff shrinking? The decline in Leadership may be because itâs a vague, nonspecific term, unlike Engineering Leadership (which is up). Engineering Leadership is concrete and itâs something our engineering-oriented audience understands. In 2024, we introduced several new features on the OâReilly learning platform, including badges, quizzes, and a new version of OâReilly Answers. What are they telling us? We started a badging program late in 2023: Users from business accounts can earn badges for taking courses and completing quizzes. We wonât go into the program details here, but since the program started, users have earned nearly 160,000 badges. Weâre still building the program, but weâre encouraged by its first year. Badges can give us more insight into what our users are learning. The most popular badges are for Python skills, followed by GPT and prompt engineering. Generative AI and machine learning are also high on the list. Kubernetes, despite its decline in units viewed, was the fourth-most-frequently-acquired badge, with almost the same number of badges earned as software architecture. Linux, SQL, professional communication, and Java rounded out the top 11. (Yes, 11âwe wanted to include Java). The difference between Java and Python is striking, given that the use of content about these skills is similar. (Python leads Java, but not by much.) Oracle has a highly regarded Java certification program, and thereâs really no equivalent for Python. Perhaps our users recognize that obtaining a Java badge is superfluous, while obtaining badges for Pythonic skills is meaningful? Quizzes are closely tied to badges: If a final quiz exists for a course or for a book, students must pass it to earn their badge. Quiz usage appears to follow the same trends as badging, though itâs premature to draw any conclusions. While a few legacy quizzes have been on the platform for a long time (and arenât connected to badging), the push to develop quizzes as part of the badging program only began in June 2024, and quiz usage is still as much a consequence of the time the quiz has been available on the platform as it is of the skill for which itâs testing. We can also look at the expertise required by the badges that were earned. All of our content is tagged with a skill level: beginner, beginner-intermediate, intermediate, intermediate-advanced, or advanced. 42% of the badges were earned for content judged to be intermediate. 33% of the badges were earned for beginner content, while only 4.4% were for advanced content. Itâs somewhat surprising that most of the badges were earned for intermediate-level content, though perhaps that makes sense given the badge programâs B2B context: For the most part, our users are professionals rather than beginners. One of our most important new features in 2024 was an upgrade to OâReilly Answers. Answers is a generative AI-powered tool that allows users to enter natural language questions and generates responses from content in our platform. Unlike most other generative AI products, Answers always provides links to the original sources its responses are based on. These citations are tracked and used to calculate author royalties and payments to publishing partners. So the obvious question is: What are our users asking? One might guess that the questions in Answers would be similar to the search terms used on the platform. (At this point, Answers and search are distinct from each other.) That guess is partly rightâand partly wrong. There are some obvious differences. Common search terms include book titles, author names, and even ISBNs; titles and author names rarely appear in Answers. The most common searches are for single words, such as âPythonâ or âJava.â (The average length of the top 5,000 searches in September 2024 was two words, for instance.) There are few single word questions in Answers (though there are some); most questions are well-formed sentences like âHow many ways can you create a string object in Java?â (The average question length was nine words.) To analyze the questions from OâReilly Answers, we essentially turned them back into single-word questions. First, we eliminated questions from a âquestion bankâ that we created to prime the pump, as it were: Rather than requiring users to write a new question, we offered a list of prewritten queries they could click on. While thereâs undoubtedly some useful signal in how the question bank was used, we were more interested in what users asked of their own volition. From the user-written questions, we created a big âbag of words,â sorted them by frequency, and eliminated stopwords. We included a lot of stopwords that arenât in most lists: words like âdataâ (what does that mean by itself?) and âchapterâ (yes, you can ask about a chapter in a book, but that doesnât tell us much). With that background in mind, what were the most common words in Answers and in searches? In order: Thereâs an obvious difference between these two lists. The Answers list consists mostly of words that could be part of longer questions. The Search list is made up of topics and skills about which one might want information. Thatâs hardly surprising or insightful. Weâve said most searches on the platform are single-word searches, which means that those words have to be stand-alone skills or topics, like Python or Java. Likewise, Answers was built to allow users to ask more detailed, in-depth questions and get focused answers from the content on our platformâso rather than seeing single word searches, weâre seeing common words from longer questions. Maybe thatâs a self-fulfilling prophecy, but itâs also showing that Answers is working the way we intended. Thereâs a little more signal here. Python and Java are the two top programming languages on both lists, but if we look at search queries, machine learning and Kubernetes are sandwiched between the two languages. That may just be a result of our usersâ experiences with services like ChatGPT. Programmers quickly learned that they can get reasonable answers to questions about Java and Python, and the prompts donât have to be very complex. My personal favorite is âHow do you flatten a list of lists in Python?,â which can be answered by most chatbots correctly but isnât meaningful to our search engine. Kubernetes raises a different question: Why is it the third-most-common search engine query but doesnât appear among the top words on Answers? (Itâs the 90th-most-common word on Answers, though the actual rank isnât meaningful.) While Kubernetes is a topic thatâs amenable to precise questions, itâs a complex tool, and coming up with precise prompts is difficult; writing a good question probably requires a good understanding of your IT infrastructure. You might need to understand how to solve your problem before you can ask a good question about how to solve your problem. A search engine doesnât face problems like this. It doesnât need additional information to return a list of resources. Then what about words like Rust and Linux, which are high on the list of common searches, but not in the top 13 for Answers? Itâs relatively easy to come up with specific questions about either of theseâor, for that matter, about SQL, AWS, or React. SQL, AWS, and Linux are reasonably close to the top of the Answers word list. If we just concern ourselves with the order in which words appear, things start to fall into place: AWS (and cloud) follow learning; they are followed by Linux, followed by SQL. Weâre not surprised that there are few questions about CISSP on Answers; itâs a certification exam, so users are more likely to want test prep material than to ask specific questions. Rust and React are still outliers, though; itâs easy to ask precise and specific questions about either of them. Rust is still unfamiliar to many of our usersâcould the explanation be that our customers want to learn Rust as a whole rather than ask specific questions that might only occur to someone whoâs already learned the language? But if you accept that, React still remains an outlier. We may know the answers next year, at which time weâll have a much longer track record with Answers. That wraps up last year. What will we see this year? Weâve given hints throughout this report. Letâs bring it all together. AI dominated the news for 2024. It will continue to do so in 2025, despite some disillusionment. For the most part, those who are disillusioned arenât the people making decisions about what products to build. While concern about jobs is understandable in a year thatâs seen significant layoffs, we donât believe that AI is âcoming for your job.â However, we do believe that the future will belong to those who learn how to use AI effectivelyâand that AI will have a profound impact on every profession, not just IT and not just âknowledge workers.â Using AI effectively isnât just about coming up with clever prompts so you can copy and paste an answer. If all you can do is prompt, copy, and paste, youâre about to become superfluous. You need to figure out how to work with AI to create something thatâs better than what the AI could do by itself. Training employees to use AI effectively is one of the best things a company can do to prepare for an AI-driven future. Companies that donât invest in training will inevitably fall behind. In the coming year, will companies build AI applications on top of the giant foundation models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini? Or will they build on top of smaller open models, many of which are based on Metaâs Llama? And in the latter case, will they run the models on-premises (which includes the use of hosting and colocation providers), or will they rent use of these open AI models as a service from various providers? In the coming year, watch carefully what happens with the small open models. They already deliver performance almost as good as the foundation models and will undoubtedly be the basis for many AI applications. And we suspect that most companies will run these models in the cloud. Security is the other significant growth area. Companies are waking up to the need to secure their data before their reputationsâand their bottom linesâare compromised. Waking up has been a long, slow process that has sunk the careers of many CEOs and CIOs, but itâs happening. Our users are studying to gain security certifications. We see companies investing in governance and putting in company-wide policies to maintain security. In this respect, AI cuts both ways. Itâs both a tool and a danger. Itâs a tool because security professionals need to watch over huge streams of data, looking for the anomalies that signal an attack; itâs a tool because AI can digest sources of information about new threats and vulnerabilities; itâs a tool because AI can automate routine tasks like report generation. But itâs also a danger. AI-enabled applications increase an organizationâs threat surface by introducing new vulnerabilities, like prompt injection, that weâre only now learning how to mitigate. We havenât yet seen a high-profile attack against AI that compromised an organizationâs ability to do business, but that will certainly happen eventuallyâmaybe in 2025. Whatever happens this year, AI will be at the center. Everyone will need to learn how to use AI effectively. AI will inevitably reshape all of our professions, but we donât yet know how; weâre only starting to get glimpses. Is that exciting or terrifying? Both.

Title: BlackRock is trying to avoid the hot seat as GOP takes power

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The world’s biggest money manager is trying to avoid some political headaches as the GOP prepares to take over all of Washington. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) late last week pulled out of a UN-supported climate group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), following the exodus of several Wall Street banks from an affiliated group in the weeks before Donald Trump takes over the White House again. BlackRock also was granted more time to resolve a standoff with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over its holdings of US banks, ensuring that the dispute will now play out in the opening months of Trump 2.0. The $11 trillion financial giant has for years been a target of GOP attacks about "woke" investing, with Republicans raising concerns about whether BlackRock’s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has backed away from using the politically contentious acronym. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. BlackRock, which reports its fourth quarter earnings Wednesday, will have to navigate all these political challenges as the GOP takes over the White House and Congress — a measure of control that could create new headaches for the money management giant. A report last month from the House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, mentioned BlackRock along with Vanguard and State Street (STT) in arguing that it found "evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior" by the financial industry to "impose radical ESG-goals" on US companies. The report also criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it called "a climate cartel." Last Thursday, BlackRock confirmed its departure from one financial environmental alliance known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The group had a pledge of support from its NZAM members to help achieve net-zero emissions carbon emissions by 2050 by using their influence within the financial sector — such as supporting climate initiatives in corporate boardrooms through proxy voting. "Our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," BlackRock told clients in a letter cited by Bloomberg. The company added in the letter that its portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." On Monday, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative said on its website that it had suspended its activities pending a review. It added in that note that "recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context." The other delicate political situation now being juggled by BlackRock is its resistance to the FDIC’s push for greater oversight. The FDIC had been asking BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a "passivity agreement" that would codify greater checks on the money manager’s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement the FDIC wanted BlackRock to sign was similar to one announced with Vanguard that imposed new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. It was designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a "passive" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won’t exert control over a bank’s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. BlackRock spent much of 2024 denying that it exerted undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. Last Friday, BlackRock's deadline to respond to information requests from the FDIC was extended to Feb. 10, punting the standoff into the start of Trump's new term as president. As a practical matter, BlackRock must either rebut any presumption it has control of more than 10% in a holding company of an FDIC-supervised bank by responding to the FDIC's most recent information requests or sign a "passivity agreement," according to one person familiar with the matter. It is not yet known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation or who will run the FDIC following the Republican takeover of the White House.

Title: Stock market today: Asian markets are mixed, echoing trading on Wall Street

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 13, 2025 at 10:45 PM Updated: January 14, 2025 at 5:43 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Most U.S. stocks rose Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation, though drops for Eli Lilly and other influential stocks kept indexes in check. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% as three out of every four stocks in the index climbed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 221 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%. Recommended Videos Stocks got a boost from a report showing inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. Speculation is growing about whether the Fed may cut rates zero times this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market. Yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.78%, where it was late Monday. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, eased to 4.36% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4.8% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.9%. Indexes drifted between gains and losses through the day in large part due to drops for several Big Tech stocks. Nvidia fell 1.1% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500. The only stock to drag more on the market was Eli Lilly, which fell 6.6% after saying it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter’s 45% growth in Lilly’s revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 21.7%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up. Such reports are always under the spotlight, but companies may be under more pressure to impress this time around. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. All told Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 6.69 points to 5,842.91. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 221.16 to 42,518.28, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 43.71 to 19,044.39. In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher across much of Europe and Asia with a few exceptions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.7% to $77.50 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.3% to $79.92 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Asian shares trade mixed after drops for Big Tech leave Wall Street mixed

Asian shares were mixed Tuesday, echoing trading on Wall Street, where gains for oil and gas producers helped offset drops for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.0% in afternoon trading to 38,394.09 following a holiday on Monday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 8,231.00. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,497.95. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.9% to 19,234.98, while the Shanghai Composite surged 2.1% to 3,227.11. “After a holiday break, Japan’s markets are playing catch-up following last week’s market selloff,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. Japan’s Finance Ministry reported that the surplus in the current account, a measure of the country's foreign exchanges in goods, services and investments, rose to 3.4 trillion yen ($21 billion) in November, up 54.5% from the same month the previous year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% after erasing an earlier fall of 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 358 points, or 0.9%, while the weakness for Big Tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite to a loss of 0.4%. Stocks have been under pressure the last month, and the S&P 500 is coming off its fourth losing week in the last five as traders reduce expectations for how much relief the Federal Reserve may deliver this year through lower interest rates. Such cuts would give the economy a boost, and the U.S. stock market ran to repeated records last year on the assumption that more are coming after the Fed began lowering rates in September. But inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target, and recent reports have suggested a still-solid U.S. economy doesn’t need much help. Questions are growing about whether the Fed will deliver even a single cut in 2025. High rates put downward pressure on prices for all kinds of investments, and those seen as expensive can feel the stiffest punches. Nvidia fell 2% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500, though that represents just a smidgen of the index's huge gains in recent years. The chip company’s stock had nearly quintupled over the last three years amid the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Apple’s 1% slip and Meta Platforms’ fall of 1.2% were also among the heaviest weights on the market. Because they’re two of the largest companies on Wall Street, their moves pack more punch on the S&P 500 than other stocks. Moderna tumbled 16.8% for the largest loss in the S&P 500 after giving a forecast for revenue this coming year that fell short of analysts’ expectations. The vaccine maker, which is seeing a slowdown in COVID-related sales, is accelerating a cost-cutting program. Macy’s fell 8.1% after saying it will likely report revenue for the last three months of 2024 that’s at or slightly below the low end of the forecast range it had earlier given. Edison International fell another 11.9% as wildfires continue to burn in the territory of its Southern California Edison utility. The utility has said fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment was involved in the ignition of the Hurst fire. On the winning side of Wall Street were oil-and-gas companies after the price of oil climbed. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $78.82, while Brent crude climbed 1.6% to $81.01. The Biden administration said Friday it’s expanding sanctions against Russia’s energy industry. Exxon Mobil gained 2.6%, and Valero Energy jumped 4.9%. By Tuesday afternoon in Asia, benchmark U.S. crude lost 38 cents to $78.44 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 47 cents to $80.54 a barrel. Shares of U.S. Steel rallied 6.1% after the Biden administration pushed back to June the deadline it imposed for the Pittsburgh-based company to unwind its proposed acquisition by Japan’s Nippon Steel. Intra-Cellular Therapies soared 34.1% after Johnson & Johnson said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company and its treatment for bipolar I and II depression for $132 per share in cash. Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7%. All told, the S&P 500 added 9.18 points to 5,836.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 358.67 to 42,297.12, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 73.53 to 19,088.10. In the bond market, which has been dictating much of Wall Street’s action lately, Treasury yields ticked higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.78% from 4.76% late Friday. It’s been climbing relentlessly over the last month, and it was below 3.65% just in September. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 157.58 Japanese yen from 157.26 yen. The euro cost $1.0252, down from $1.0274. ZenMarket helps you buy and ship goods from Japan.

Title: Here’s Why Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB) Is Among Monday’s Top Losers

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Drop on Bearish Statements, Disappointing Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies—mostly under the quantum computing sector—kicked off the trading week leading declines amid not-so-optimistic statements from chief executives and disappointing earnings updates that have weighed in on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indices ended mixed, with the Dow Jones and S&P’s main index the only gainers, up 0.86 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.38 percent. To come up with Monday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) tumbled by 11.15 percent on Monday, a fourth consecutive day, to finish at $23.91 each following a statement that appears to be a jab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiling its own plan to return rock and dust samples that the latter has been collecting from Mars’ Jezero Crater since 2021. Earlier this week, NASA said that it needed more time to determine the path forward for its Mars Sample Return program, punting a decision until mid-2026. But Rocket Lab believes the best solution is right under the agency’s nose. “We can wait another year, or we can get started now,” the company wrote in a post on X. “This is not our first encounter with the Red Planet. The orbiters, rovers, landers, and helicopters of Mars all bear Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)’s fingerprints.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed after drops for Big Tech leave Wall Street mixed

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks gained ground in afternoon trading on Wall Street Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% in afternoon trading, after wobbling between gains and losses earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 201 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:14 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher. A report showed inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery price registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. But speculation is growing about whether the Fed may not cut rates at all this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market, but yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.79% from 4.78% late Monday after a couple oscillations in the morning. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, edged down to 4.37% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.2%. Drops in several Big Tech stocks had weighed down the market through much of the day, before several of them reversed course. Apple and Microsoft both erased earlier losses and were both up 0.1% in afternoon trading. Eli Lilly fell 7.4% after it said it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter's 45% growth in Lilly's revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 22.1%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up. Such reports are always under the spotlight, but companies may be under even more pressure to impress this time around. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher across much of Europe and Asia with a few exceptions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.1% to $76.49 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.2% to $80.07 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Sign in to access your portfolio

Tech drags down Nasdaq U.S. markets were mixed Monday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, but the Nasdaq Composite fell amid a broad tech sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.55%, with most sectors in negative territory. U.K. borrowing costs ticked higher Monday, raising concerns on public spending cuts or further tax rises. Potential new U.S. Steel bidCleveland Cliffs is partnering with rival Nucor in a potential bid for U.S. Steel, whose takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel was blocked by the White House earlier this month, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The offer would be in the high $30s a share. Nippon had planned to buy U.S. Steel for $55 per share in a deal valued at more than $14 billion. Slowing inflation in IndiaIndia's annual consumer inflation in December came in at 5.22%, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The reading's lower than the 5.30% forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts, and the second straight month that price growth fell. The softer inflation reading offers room to the RBI to cut rates, amid slowing growth in the country. Second blow to quantum stocksQuantum computing stocks sold off Monday after Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a Friday podcast by Joe Rogan that the technology is "quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." The comments reinforce recent commentary from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that suggested that the computers are likely 15 to 30 years away. [PRO] Rieder would 100% buy the Nasdaq The Nasdaq Composite underperformed other major indexes on Monday as investors rotated out of tech names. BlackRock's Rick Rieder, who is the company's chief investment officer of global fixed income, told CNBC he would "one hundred percent" buy the Nasdaq dip. Rieder explains his decision and how he would deploy downside protection. Tech stocks underperformed on Monday as investors took profit on the victors of 2024 and looked for this year's winner. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.38%. Big tech names popular with investors broadly fell in Monday's session. Palantir — the top-performing stock in the S&P last year —slid 3.4%, while Nvidia lost 2%, building upon their losses from last week. Nvidia fell almost 6% during the period, while Palantir lost more than 15%. "That's a necessary part of a corrective phase in our view and we are likely further along in this correction than many investors recognize since many stocks peaked in late November, early December," said AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk, adding that Friday's jobs report "cemented" those concerns. However, the S&P 500 inched up 0.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index climbed 0.86% as investors rotated into nontech shares such as Amgen, Caterpillar and UnitedHealth. That's not to say those sectors will be taking the mantle of market leader anytime soon — or at all. Sectoral rotation is a common phenomenon in markets, as investors secure their returns and look for the next stocks with upside potential. And the backdrop of rising rates puts more pressure on growth-oriented tech stocks than value stocks, which typically make up the Dow. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence frenzy isn't over, judging by the latest earnings reports from TSMC and Foxconn, which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Both companies saw their revenue boom on high demand for AI-related products. A long-term rotation out of tech and AI isn't likely. But one within the field cannot be dismissed. — CNBC's Samantha Subin, Hakyung Kim and Brian Evans contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Net Zero asset managers suspend operations in wake of BlackRock’s departure
URL: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-net-zero-asset-managers-suspend-operations-in-wake-of-blackrocks/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T23:38:00Z
Full Content:
A global coalition of asset managers set up to meet net-zero goals has suspended its operations after the departure of its largest member, BlackRock Inc., in the latest retreat from concerted climate action in the finance sector. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, said on Monday it launched a review to determine whether the group “remains fit for purpose in the new global context.” That context is marked by pushback against corporate environmental, social and governance programs that has intensified with the political shift to the right, especially in the United States, along with antitrust concerns. The group, which has more than 325 signatories with a total of US$57.5-trillion of assets under management, will halt its activities while it tracks climate-related implementation and reporting among its remaining members. It also removed its commitment statement and list of signatories from its website, it said in an unsigned statement. Last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it was leaving the NZAMI because its membership created confusion about its business practices and prompted “legal inquiries” from public officials. It said the move did not change the way it managed funds, and that its portfolio managers still assess climate risks. The NZAMI said it was disappointed by the move but that it respected the decisions its signatories make. NZAMI’s suspension follows a mass exodus of U.S. banks from its sister organization, the Net Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, raising questions about its future. Last week, JP Morgan Chase & Co. quit that organization, after the exits of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. since the beginning of December. Each said its decision to leave the group did not mean it was abandoning its net-zero goals or efforts to help clients meet their emission-reduction targets. Canada’s Big Six banks remain members of the alliance, but the CEOs of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal said at a conference last week that the NZBA may not be the most effective tool to encourage climate change efforts at major financial institutions. Companies still need to manage climate risks and prepare for a lower-carbon economy, but worldwide organizations may not be the best way to accomplish that given differing situations in various jurisdictions, said Baltej Sidhu, an analyst at National Bank Financial. “A large portion of this is going to be actuated toward litigation concerns, and also the politicization of the theme of ESG in the U.S.,” Mr. Sidhu said. BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink had been at the forefront of integrating climate risks and decarbonization targets into its investing activities, but in recent years has backed off prioritizing the fight against climate change in his public messaging. In November, Texas Attorney-General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group, accusing the major institutional investors of constricting the fossil fuel industry through “anticompetitive trade practices” by buying up shares and pushing green-energy goals. The fund managers have called the charges baseless. Vanguard quit NZAMI two years ago. The sector-specific alliances exist under an umbrella called Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was unveiled with fanfare at the United Nations climate summit in 2021 as excitement over the potential for the might of the finance industry being directed at climate action crescendoed. Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor – and potential federal Liberal leadership hopeful – Mark Carney, and Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg L.P. and a former mayor of New York, are co-chairs.

Title: Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?

Time Published: 2025-01-13T22:00:24Z

Watch CBS News By Julia Ingram Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: January 13, 2025 / 5:00 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise. "There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America," Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. "If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE." The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas. Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71. Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years. Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues. More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position. "The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes," said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. "If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor." Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages. Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills. In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract. These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said. "Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs." Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers. The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed. "Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters," said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, "There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent." Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow. But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers. When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable. Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe. Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023. The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform. How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed "Buy American and Hire American," aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a "great program." Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would "go to war on this issue" in one X post. "I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas," Trump said. "That's why we have them."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. The rise in yields and now the rise in energy prices remain in focus. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, premarket weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: ‘Fact-Checking Is A Good Thing!’ CNN’s Jim Acosta Praises Biden For Slamming ‘Shameful’ Zuckerberg Move
URL: https://www.mediaite.com/news/fact-checking-is-a-good-thing-cnns-jim-acosta-praises-biden-for-slamming-shameful-zuckerberg-move/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T19:48:18Z
Full Content:
CNN anchor Jim Acosta and media correspondent Brian Stelter praised President Joe Biden on Monday for slamming Mark Zuckerberg’s “shameful” decision to end fact-checking on Facebook. Zuckerberg’s decision to end Meta’s fact-checking program drew a rebuke from Biden on Friday, when he told reporters “The idea that, you know, a billionaire can buy something and say, ‘By the way, we’re not gonna fact check anything,’ and you know, you have millions of people reading, going online, reading this stuff, it is– Anyway, I think it’s really shameful.” On Monday’s edition of CNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta, Acosta and Stelter defended the Biden administration against Zuckerberg’s recent complaints, and agreed with Biden that the fact-checking move was “really shameful” because “We’ve got to have facts in this society”: JIM ACOSTA: Brian, this is the same man who banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram in 2021. I was at the White House the day that he was kicked off of Twitter. A lot has changed. What a difference four years makes. BRIAN STELTER: And I’m glad you brought that up. It was Zuckerberg. It was Facebook that banned Trump from the platform, just as Twitter did. And now here we are. And there’s very much a MAGA makeover of Meta happening. Look, I heard a business analyst describe Zuckerberg as a really effective shapeshifter, and I think that’s a great phrase for what is happening. Zuckerberg is shifting because he believes that’s what’s best for his shareholders. And remember, he owns 13% of Meta. He is a billionaire many times over thanks to that stock price that’s been on a tear lately. So he is trying to evolve the company to make sure it is successful in the Trump years. And that means, number one, being cozy to Trump, to the president-elect, keeping it in the good graces of the government, maybe making that pesky FTC antitrust case go away. It has a lot of business before the U.S. government. And I think that’s ultimately what this is all about. JIM ACOSTA: Yeah, and he’s complaining about the Biden administration, you know, yelling at them to say, you know, get some of this Covid misinformation off their platforms. I mean, isn’t that that’s sort of what the White House should be doing, right? I mean, tell folks to get this garbage off these platforms, if you can, as best as you can– to get rid of fact checking altogether, especially during these wildfires. I mean, that sounds like something that could really, you know, backfire big-time. BRIAN STELTER: It’s just so easy for years later to sit around and say, you know, they were pressuring us. We went too far during an emergency, right? The early months of the Covid pandemic were an emergency unlike anything that we’ve lived through before. And were there some mistakes? Were there some screw ups? Were there some poor decisions? Of course. But it’s so easy to sit back and claim that now, as opposed to honestly reflect on what happened. And I think so much of this debate about free speech, you know, acts as if it’s very simple, when in fact, many of these operations are very complex. Ultimately, it’s about values. And I was so struck, Jim, by President Biden kind of shaming Meta the other day, shaming Zuckerberg and saying that it was shameful to remove the fact checkers. Biden obviously valuing fact, checking, even though he was often fact jacked during his four years in office. JIM ACOSTA: Right. I mean, Fact-checking is a good thing! It’s not a bad thing! And Brian, I mean, is that correct that they’re just not going to have fact checking altogether on these very powerful platforms? BRIAN STELTER: All of Meta’s, financing of fact checking is going away effective in March and it’ll be replaced by community notes, you know, letting users police themselves and decide what is true and false. It’s going to result in a much more chaotic and confusing information environment. And that’s ultimately the big picture about what this is about and why it matters. And that’s what Biden was getting at in his recent interview with USA Today. He said his biggest regret as president was not being able to navigate this changing information environment. We’ve heard some of his cabinet secretaries say the same thing, that they feel like they’re outmatched in this environment. Ultimately, when we’re talking about facts versus fiction, we should ask who benefits from the fictions? Who benefits from an environment where there are more lies, more propaganda, more innuendo spreading? And who suffers? You know, that’s the kind of cost benefit analysis that I think Zuckerberg is kind of trying to avoid as he curry favor with the incoming administration. JIM ACOSTA: Yeah, fact checking is not always popular, but it is necessary. We’ve got to have facts in this society. Watch above via CNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta. Have a tip or story idea? Email us.

Title: Why Tech Stocks Are Dropping Monday

Technology stocks struggled across the board Monday, including declines among Magnificent 7 firms and a big hit to quantum computing stocks. The S&P 500 technology sector fell about 0.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished 0.4% lower. The decline follows broad market struggles on Friday after labor market data for December came in hotter than expected, leading investors to scale back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Magnificent 7 were not spared, with Nvidia (NVDA) stock losing 2% and Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) shares declining about 1%. The only member of the group in the green was Tesla (TSLA), with shares up 2%. Nvidia's drop came even as the chipmaker announced a series of AI healthcare partnerships with Mayo Clinic, IQVIA Holdings (IQV), and Illumina (ILMN) on Monday, as the Biden administration proposed new rules on exporting AI chips. Nvidia called the new restrictions, meant to limit AI chip sales to certain countries, "misguided" in a blog post Monday. Shares of quantum computing companies continued to slide Monday after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed the lead of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with comments throwing cold water on the sector. In a Friday appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Zuckerberg said he believes quantum computing is "still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." That followed comments from Huang last week that "very useful quantum computers" are still 15 to 30 years away. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) shares plunged 32%, while D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) lost close to 34%, IonQ (IONQ) fell 14%, and Quantum Computing (QUBT) dropped 27%. UPDATE—Jan. 13, 2025: This article has been updated to include additional information on proposed U.S. export rules and reflect more recent share price values.

Title: Eli Lilly's weight loss pill could get federal approval by early next year

Time Published: 2025-01-13T16:41:00Z
Full Content:
Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY+0.06%) thinks its next experimental weight-loss pill could get approved as soon as early 2026. CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News on Monday that data on the drug, orforglipron, is expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory clearance the following year, Ricks said in an interview at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference (JPM+2.26%) in San Francisco. Ricks also said that pills would be easier to manufacture en masse, and more simple for patients to consume, than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including Eli Lilly’s popular Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+2.53%) Wegovy and Ozempic, although a few pills have emerged; Novo Nordisk sells a pill form of semaglutide, under the brand name Rybelsus, for treating type 2 diabetes. Read More: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The growing demand for GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, caused a shortage of both Zepbound and Mounjaro, Lilly’s other weight-loss drug, last year. Zepbound was only taken off the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list in October, while tirzepatide — the active ingredient in both drugs — was taken off in December. Eli Lilly is building a $9 billion manufacturing complex in Lebanon, Indiana, to produce key components for its GLP-1 drugs, including tirzepatide, alongside a $4.5 billion research center. It’s also invested several billion dollars in facilities in Ireland and Germany. “We will continue to increase supply, but taking into account the huge need there would probably continue to be supply constraints until we had an oral medicine with an injectable-like efficacy,” President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity Patrik Jonsson told Quartz in May. “I think this is really an opportunity to reach more patients and also the ones that are currently fearful of injections,” Jonsson added. Surging demand for these drugs transformed pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Lilly into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS+5.29%) analysts anticipate the global market for the highly coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. In a boost to both companies, Zepbound and Wegovy have been approved for Medicare coverage. The newly expanded coverage could help many patients, as insurers have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Zepbound costs $1,086.37 per month without insurance. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia and other AI stocks are bleeding after Biden issued new AI rules

The stock market is in the red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunging more than 1% on Monday morning as new regulatory measures introduced by President Biden have severely impacted artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. These changes have raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related companies. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. Several AI-related stocks were also down on the Nasdaq, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), Micron (MU+6.40%), and Palantir (PLTR+3.77%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Other tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq were also down Monday morning, with Apple (AAPL+1.95%), Meta (META+4.31%), and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD+4.58%) down by 2.2%, 1.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. —Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Nvidia Slams Biden ‘Overreach’ And Praises Trump—As AI Stock Enters Correction Territory

Nvidia blasted the Biden administration and hyped President-elect Donald Trump in a Monday press release reacting to more export restrictions targeting Nvidia’s highly sought-after artificial intelligence chips, a criticism coinciding with a rare down stretch on Wall Street for Nvidia—and mounting Silicon Valley support for Trump. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris discuss AI in 2023. President Joe Biden announced Monday a framework to govern the transfer of AI technology most famously designed by Nvidia to cap AI chip sales abroad at both the country and company levels, a move which the White House characterized as an effort to keep away the advanced AI systems out of the hands of “countries of concern” as Biden has voiced concern about China’s use of American-made AI throughout his presidency. The potential for limited exports poses a potential headache for Nvidia, as China, Singapore and Taiwan accounted for more than half of the company’s $35 billion in revenue during its most recent financial quarter, with China alone accounting for $5.4 billion of Nvidia’s quarterly sales. Nvidia lashed out against the rules in a strongly worded statement: “The new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” clapped back Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, arguing it’s an attempt from the White House “to rig market outcomes and stifle competition.” The Nvidia response also indicated a warm attitude toward Trump, as Finkle wrote the “first Trump Administration laid the foundation” for the recent AI revolution. Nvidia looks “forward to a return to policies that strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond,” Finkle added. Shares of Nvidia fell as much as 4.7% to $129.51 shortly after market open, as pressure on its abroad business accelerated its recent stock market slump. The stock was down more than 15% from its all-time-high share price set last week, erasing as much as $578 billion in market capitalization from its $3.75 trillion valuation peak set Tuesday morning. Other big technology stocks struggled Monday, with shares of Alphabet, Apple and Tesla all declining at least 1% as the S&P 500 benchmark index sank to its lowest level since early November. Much of Nvidia’s stock surge came while Biden was in office. The company’s share price is up 880% since Biden’s 2021 inauguration, compared to a 414% rally during Trump’s first term, according to FactSet data. Nvidia is far from the first big tech firm to express excitement about the prospects of Trump’s second term, with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet committing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund as industry leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos all met with Trump following his November election win. Zuckerberg also announced sweeping changes to Meta’s policies ahead of Trump’s inauguration: The company is ditching fact-checks in favor of X-style community notes, and Trump ally Dana White will join the board. Trump’s administration includes the newly-created role of “White House AI & Crypto Czar,” filled by Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks, in an effort to make the U.S. “the clear global leader” in AI and cryptocurrency, Trump said in December. Nvidia is the face of the 2020s generative AI boom, as it designs a majority of the data-intensive hardware and software systems used to train AI technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot and Tesla’s self-driving programs.

Title: A Major Global Bank Expects NVIDIA To Earn $236 Billion From Datacenter GPUs In CY2025

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As the outgoing Biden administration significantly tightens the American noose around AI chips, narrowing NVIDIA's TAM in the process, HSBC is out today with a rare sobering take on the GPU maker's near-term prospects. To wit, HSBC analyst Frank Lee notes at the outset that NVIDIA will be "under increasing pressure to deliver an even stronger H2 FY26 ramp of its GB300/B300 platform" to counter the "potentially weaker H1 FY26 momentum." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's FY2026 roughly aligns with CY2025. Consequently, given the chipmaker's reduced sales-related momentum in the first half of 2025 vs. previously baked-in expectations, Lee now expects NVIDIA to sell ~35,000 NVL72-equivalent AI server racks in CY 2025 as opposed to HSBC's previous sales assumption of 41,500 AI racks, equating to lower full-year datacenter revenue estimate of just around $236 billion from an earlier estimation of $253 billion. Interestingly, Lee's bear-case scenario for NVIDIA entails full-year datacenter-related sales of "20K-25K NVL racks" and an EPS estimate of between $4.84 and $5.14, which "remains 8%/14% above consensus [estimate] of USD4.50." Lee goes on to note: "We lower our FY26 EPS estimates by 6% to reflect slower H1 FY26 Blackwell ramp." Given this reduced full-year EPS estimate, HSBC has trimmed its "target price [for NVIDIA shares] to USD185 (from USD195) based on an unchanged target FY26 PE of 32x." Of course, as stated earlier, HSBC's revisions are premised on a slower production ramp-up of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture GPUs. Nonetheless, do note that Jensen Huang recently declared at the CES 2025 that "Blackwell is in full production" now. $NVDA White House confirms global curbs on exports of AI chips by Nvidia and its peers; No restrictions apply to chip sales to 18 key allies and partners; Trump administration to decide how and whether to implement curbs - Six key mechanisms in the rule catalyze the… — TradeTheNews.com (@Trade_The_News) January 13, 2025 Meanwhile, as stated earlier, the outgoing Biden administration has now significantly tightened the US export controls around AI chips: The Biden Administration's "AI Diffusion" rule will stifle innovation and undermine America’s global technology leadership. Restricting access to mainstream computing risks derailing AI progress for industries at home and abroad. America’s strength lies in innovation and… — NVIDIA (@nvidia) January 13, 2025 Given the significant sales-related implications of this measure, it is hardly a surprise that NVIDIA has slammed Biden administration's AI diffusion rules by declaring that they will "stifle innovation and undermine America’s global technology leadership." The statement goes on to note that "this rule will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell on Monday as a continued selloff in tech stocks extended losses sparked by stronger-than-expected job reports. In the late afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.78%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and 0.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a fresh high of 4.77%. Oil prices also surged 3.4%, with West Texas Intermediate reaching $79.2 per barrel, marking their highest levels since early October. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+5.87%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM+2.56%) and UnitedHealth (UNH+0.16%) on Thursday. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on the key inflation indicators, the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), this week. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Several AI-related stocks were also down, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), Micron (MU+6.40%), and Palantir (PLTR+3.77%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (MRNA+0.87%) plunged more than 23% after the company slashed its sales guidance for the year. Moderna now projects 2025 revenue between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, a significant downgrade from its earlier forecast of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion posted in September. Shares of Lululemon (LULU-2.84%) surged 2.5% after the company raised its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected performance during the holiday season. The retailer now anticipates sales between $3.56 billion and $3.58 billion, up from its previous forecast of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion. The update is a positive development for investors, as the athletic apparel company has faced sluggish sales over the past year. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+3.07%) spiked one week before Donald Trump is set to return to the White House for his second term in office. Trump Media stock surged more than 21% on Monday afternoon, trading at $43.17 per share. That’s among the largest single-day jumps in the company’s share value since Trump won the presidential election. In the time since Nov. 5, shares of the company — which owns Trump’s right-wing social media platform, Truth Social — have climbed 21%. Despite stocks and cryptocurrencies rallying following Trump’s election victory, Trump Media shares, which had become something of a proxy for Trump’s election odds, had a surprisingly muted response to the election results. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Jefferies upgraded Etsy (ETSY) to Hold from Underperform with a price target of $55, up from $45. The firm cites improved second half growth and a more balanced risk-reward on the shares for the upgrade of Etsy. Needham upgraded KLA Corp. (KLAC) to Buy from Hold as it lowered its 2025 wafer fab equipment estimate from $110B to $100B and launched a 2026 estimate at $100B. Needham sees 2025 as likely the peak WFE, saying the current semiconductor upcycle "will be lukewarm," and the next downturn could hit in the second half of 2026. Morgan Stanley upgraded Elf Beauty (ELF) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $153, up from $139. The stocks' valuation looks compelling relative to Elf's "outsized" long-term growth potential after a sharp pullback in the stock in the second half of 2024, the firm tells investors in a research note. Needham upgraded Instacart (CART) to Buy from Hold with a $56 price target, and added the shares to the firm's Conviction List. The stronger than expected results in 2024 suggest fears over competition and total addressable market pull forward are overblown, likely driven by Instacart's leading customer experience in grocery, which continues to improve, the firm tells investors in a research note. Evercore ISI upgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to In Line from Underperform with a $365 price target. The firm says that while it is hard to be a construction bull amid interest rates continuing to surprise to the upside, the stocks are down and investor expectations are now "greatly reduced." Top 5 Downgrades: Jefferies downgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $32, down from $40. The firm downgraded Pinterest on expectations of slower Performance+ rollout and margin growth against its "more muted" advertising checks. JPMorgan downgraded Constellation Brands (STZ) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $203, down from $262, following the fiscal Q3 miss. While secular trends including premiumization and faster growth in legal-drinking age Hispanic consumers benefits the company's portfolio, this is balanced by near-term prolonged pressure on lower-income and Hispanic consumers and overhangs from lower consumption of alcohol by younger consumers, potential impacts from weight loss drugs, and tariff risk, the firm tells investors in a research note. Jefferies also downgraded Constellation Brands to Hold from Buy. TD Cowen downgraded STMicroelectronics (STM) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $32. STMicroelectronics is a leader in power semis with its manufacturing network a long-term advantage, but its near-term revenue and margins are likely to remain muted, the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley downgraded LiveRamp (RAMP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $35. The firm sees limited catalysts for the company to accelerate growth and investor sentiment, and sees better risk/rewards elsewhere in its coverage. Truist downgraded Accolade (ACCD) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $7.03, down from $7.50, after Transcarent announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the company for $7.03 per share in cash. Top 5 Initiations: Citi resumed coverage of Symbotic (SYM) with a Buy rating and $37 price target. The firm has continued conviction in Symbotic's ability to deliver strong earnings growth over time as the company remains a key beneficiary from investments across warehouse automation, which it believes remains an underpenetrated end market. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Axis Capital (AXS) with a Market Perform rating and $93 price target. BMO's caution on the direction of pricing and its ability to sustain growth/its improved loss ratio tempers its bullishness for the shares. BMO Capital initiated coverage of PG&E (PCG) with an Outperform rating and $21 price target. The firm sees the company shares as a core holding in the regulated utility sector, providing investors with exposure to a "rare deep value opportunity with premium visible growth." Truist initiated coverage of California Resources (CRC) with a Buy rating and $75 price target. The company has begun to see the fruits of its carbon management platform labor/assets, recently announcing California's first approved CCS project following receipt of final Class VI well permits from the EPA and an MOU with Net Power to develop Net Power's ultra-low emission power plants in California. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Newmont (NEM) with a Buy rating and $47.20 price target. As major projects progress and $3B of divestments complete, Newmont's portfolio will transition to a largely Tier 1 asset base, supporting accelerated de-leveraging and capital management, the firm tells investors in a research note.

Title: There’s a reason why it feels like the internet has gone bad | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Facebook is full of AI slop. X is full of “free thinkers” peddling conspiracies. Google’s search results are telling us to eat rocks. More and more, it feels like the internet has gone bad. There’s an increasingly popular theory about why: “enshittification.” The term, coined in 2022 by the author, journalist and activist Cory Doctorow, refers broadly to the deterioration of services (especially online) as a result of giant companies extracting maximum profits from their customers. In a 2023 essay for Wired, Doctorow laid out the basic arc of enshittification, or the process by which platforms die. “First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.” In other words: Products are good when they first hit the market, because companies need to lock in as many consumers as they can to achieve the huge scale they desire. Once everyone’s using the product, the company refocuses on creating value for business partners, padding its profit margins and letting the product corrode. Eventually, the company maxes out what it can extract from its business partners, too, and the whole thing fades into obsolescence. Once you wrap your head around the idea, you start to see enshittification all around — not only online, but across the economy, in services that have been picked over by private equity (vet clinics, nursing homes, prisons, countless other industries) or in the products peddled by highly concentrated industries. The Australian dictionary Macquarie even crowned it the 2024 word of the year, noting its power to capture “what many of us feel is happening to the world and to so many aspects of our lives at the moment.” On Tuesday, shortly after Meta’s CEO announced a widely criticized plan to dispense with fact-checkers, I spoke with Doctorow about the future of social media and how “enshittification” can help us make sense of our collective online angst. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: Could you give me your your cocktail-party-level introduction to “enshittification”? Cory Doctorow: I think of enshittification as a theory about what happens when you have power without consequence. We have increased the power available to large firms for a long time by reducing our antitrust enforcement, allowing mergers, predatory pricing, all the conduct that allows firms to get very big. That’s been across the board, not just with tech. Nightcap: What does that look like, in real life? Doctorow: There’s a law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that makes it illegal to break digital rights management. So for example, if Audible (which is owned by Amazon) sells you one of my audiobooks, they require that it have digital rights management that locks it to Audible’s platform forever — you can’t unlock it, quit Audible and take your books with you. And if I give you a tool to jailbreak the audiobook so you can go somewhere else, I commit a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. So even though I am the rights holder to that work, Amazon, the intermediary who sold you the work, has more intellectual-property rights to that work than I do. This is a law that is oriented around allowing these large firms to wield regulation against competitors, against their own workforce and against their users so that they can maintain power. It’s a collapse of discipline — they don’t have to worry about their workers, they don’t have to worry about regulators. And they bought all their competitors. Nightcap: Meta would seem like a kind of textbook case of enshittification. Facebook used to feel like a premium service, but the last few years it’s felt like it’s lost the plot. Doctorow: Meta is a great example because they go through this pretty neat set of stages… They had this very straightforward value prop, which was like, just tell us who matters to you, and we’ll show you everything they post. And their pitch to the general public was, Facebook is like MySpace, but we won’t spy on you. Nightcap: Right, that feels very much like aughts-era Facebook, when we could all just see our friends and enjoy the virtual connection. What changed? Doctorow: Facebook at a certain point goes to publishers and says, create a Facebook page, post short excerpts to it, don’t worry about how many people follow you — we’re going to recommend it to users. So we’re going to show users things that they never asked to see in order to take some value away from them and give it to publishers. You see the same thing with advertisers. Facebook not only offers to use surveillance data to benefit advertisers in the form of targeting, but they also invest heavily in anti-ad-fraud and in services to advertisers. So if your ads are not performing, they’ll help you figure it out, but also, if someone’s ripping you off, they’ll help you get your money back. And so you see the users getting locked in by each other. They’re providing so much value to each other that they can’t bring themselves to leave, even as the service is getting monotonically worse. And that’s as far as I think a lot of people take it — “Facebook’s got a mind control ray, they’re hacking your dopamine loops, and you can’t escape Facebook and they’re gonna sell you to advertisers.” The evidence for “hacking your dopamine loops” is pretty thin. There’s much better evidence that people just care about their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg, and so they stay there. Nightcap: Your theory adds a third step here, where Facebook also turns its back on advertisers, too? Doctorow: Right, once the advertisers were fully committed to a Facebook strategy, advertising got way more expensive and the amount of ad fraud you got was crazy. So the advertisers are getting screwed, the publishers are getting screwed, the end users are getting screwed. Nightcap: I’m not asking you to look into a crystal ball here, but if you had to speculate, what’s next for Facebook or other decaying platforms? Doctorow: Zuckerberg is insulated from the consequences of making bad choices until he’s not, right? Until things reach a breaking point, and then he tends to panic. Tech calls these panics “pivots,” but they’re just the outcome of being the CEO of a company that posts anemic growth or even a contraction in its user base and sees (Wall Street) just go nuts on you. First, it was the Metaverse… which is like a not-very-successful video game that they spent billions on. Zuck could do that because he controls the majority of the voting shares and because he had huge cash reserves. And now we’re seeing these weird announcements that they’re going to have AI -generated users who are going to interact with you. This is, again, a visibly terrible idea. It could be a way to continue to post growth if users will tolerate it. But the equilibrium that Zuck has shot for, with Facebook and with Instagram, has been a service that is nearly so bad that people want to leave. The anthropologist danah boyd describes how in the last days of MySpace, she could see how when one person who a lot of people talk to would leave, then a whole bunch of people would follow. It wasn’t the only reason they were there, but it was the last thing keeping them there, and then, boom, the bottom falls out and the net just starts to unravel. This is where Facebook is. They are trying to maintain this equilibrium where they extract enough that they keep their shareholders happy, but not so much that people leave. They’re now at the end of a long run of extremely bad choices. I’m not shorting Meta stock, but I think that they are on the path to becoming a kind of zombie — something like MySpace is today. You know, MySpace still exists. You can go to MySpace. It’s just AI-generated slop and and spam. (Note: Meta didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) Nightcap: How are you feeling about the future of tech? Doctorow: In terms of the future of enshittification, these platforms that have hollowed themselves out, where there’s just no value left in them except this kind of awful lock-in. It’s the old “we go broke a little, and then all at once.” I do think there is reason to be hopeful. As a science fiction writer, I know that prediction is a mug’s game. But as an activist, I’m like, well, you take the weakest flank where you can make the biggest strategic advance, and you march on that flank. And there are a lot of weak flanks in global big tech. I’d say the last one is the potential for an alliance between people who are angry about other kinds of monopolies, because it’s not just tech — people are really angry about grocery monopolies and oil monopolies, sea freight monopolies, eyeglass monopolies. One company, EssilorLuxottica, owns every eyewear brand you’ve ever heard of and every eyewear store you’ve ever shopped at, and they make more than 50% of the lenses, and they own EyeMed, the largest insurer in the world, and they’ve raised the price of glasses 1,000% in the last decade. (EssilorLuxottica didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) So people are pissed off about monopolies. And if they can make a coalition, it’ll be like when we discovered the word “ecology” in the ’70s — we realized that just because you care about owls and I care about the ozone layer, it doesn’t mean we’re not caring about the same thing.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. When investing in high-growth stocks, names like Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and various tech companies are often mentioned. While Palantir is known for its data analytics platforms and is seen as the “new oil” by many investors, Rigetti is a leading company in quantum computing. It is developing technology that could revolutionize many industries, from pharmaceutics to cryptography. One such investor, at only 19 years old, has a clear vision for his financial future. With $3K to $4K or 33% of his portfolio, saved for high-growth buys, this young investor aims to hold these stocks for 10 to 15 years, but he wants to make an informed decision. Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. “I would like to dedicate $3K-$4K (around 33% of my portfolio) to purchasing some long-term individual stocks with high growth potential. I plan to leave money in these for the next 10 years,” he wrote. He’s drawn to several high-growth buys, including PLTR, RGTI, BBAI and a few other 3D printing stocks, but he’s unsure whether these are a good bet. Because he’s found himself at such a pivotal moment, he sought advice in Reddit’s r/investing community, mentioning that his goal is to secure growth over at least a decade – or more. As the Reddit community rallied to offer advice, the comment section became a debate field, with commenters disputing whether these high-risk, high-reward picks are right or whether a more diversified strategy would better serve the 19-year-old. See Also: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Let’s review the most common suggestions Redditors have given the young investor. Better Start With An Index Fund Like VOO, VTI or SPY Many commenters in the thread recommended the investor put his money into an index fund like VOO, SPY or VTI because they are simple to use and control, offer diversification and have growth potential in the long run. “The fact that you ask someone else what you should invest in means an index fund like VOO or SPY is right for you. This way, you don't have to analyze companies or do any of the tedious due diligence,” the very first comment reads. One Reddit member suggested that an index fund would be a better bet in almost all investing cases, mentioning VOO and VTI as his favorite. “In almost all cases, buying an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund ... a.k.a, a basket of stocks all owned under one ticket) is your best bet. VOO and VTI are my two favorites (VOO tracks the S&P 500, VTI tracks the total U.S. market),” the Redditor said. A third Redditor shared his investing experience, saying that he’s spent a lot of time researching and picking individual stocks, but only three beat VOO when he sold 15 of them. “I backtested my stocks and of the 15 or so stocks I sold, only three beat the S&P 500. If I had put all that money in VOO or VTI, I would have made more money than I did in individual stocks. Considering the time, stress and effort I put into individual stocks I came out way behind,” the Redditor’s comment reads. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Buy blue chip stocks for Long-Term Growth and Allocate a Smaller Portfolio Slot to Speculative Stocks Blue chip stocks like Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia were mentioned throughout the comments, as the Redditors who suggested them see these stocks as stable and profitable in the long run. “I'm about 80% S&P, 15% MSFT, 5% NVDA. Microsoft is one of those companies that rarely misses and I'll always hold it in my portfolio. Nvidia just makes sense to have for the next 5-10 years,” a comment says. Another commenter recommended Microsoft and Nvidia because, according to him, the companies holding them have solid fundamentals. “If you're thinking 10-15 years, consider looking into companies with solid fundamentals, like MSFT, NVDA or even some high-growth ETFs,” he says. Several Reddit members also suggested allocating a smaller portion of one’s portfolio to speculative stocks like RKLB, PLTR or RGTI. “RKLB will hit $100 a share by January 2026,” a comment reads. One Redditor recommended adding PLTR to the portfolio but emphasized how important diversification is. “PLTR could be a play but don't ignore the value of diversification,” he says. Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 is a solid gaming keyboard that’s effortless to use. The analog switches with their adjustable actuation points work well in practice, thanks to the feedback they provide. However, this is a rather specialist feature that not every gamer will want or need, and given the hefty price tag, there are better value wireless gaming keyboards out there. Excellent gaming performance Analog switches work well Premium build quality Expensive Lacking some analog tweaks Typing not the best Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 is the latest incarnation in the brand’s line of elite gaming keyboards, with various improvements for even better gaming performance. The looks downplay its gaming prowess, with the RGB lighting and floating keycaps being the only signals in this regard. Still, it looks smart and sophisticated, and the build quality is excellent. It’s quite thick yet not as heavy as you might expect. Every aspect of its built feels premium, right down to the included wrist pad, which is soft yet durable; it’s easily on a par with the best gaming keyboard out there. The double shot PBT keycaps also feel great, with a pleasantly grainy texture. There are various keyboard shortcuts available by default, accessible via SteelSeries’ Meta modifier key (essentially a function key). These include altering the global actuation point, toggling rapid trigger, changing profiles, recording macros, and switching between three Bluetooth devices. Similar functions can also be found on the OLED screen in the top right corner of the Apex Pro, with navigation achieved via a dedicated button and the volume wheel. This screen can also be customized in SteelSeries’ GG software, letting you upload images and GIFs to display, and can be used to view system and in-game information. Overall GG is easy to use and offers plenty of other customizations to sink your teeth into. There are various keyboard shortcuts to configure, although the system-level functions are lacking somewhat. There are also default profiles for certain games, including Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, Minecraft and League of Legends. You can set binds to activate on press or release, and the dual actuation mode lets you assign two binds to a single key, each one activated depending on how hard you press, which works effectively. It’s a shame, though, that there’s no visual feedback to show how your actuation settings work in practice. When it comes to gaming, the Apex Pro really shines: the clack of key presses is very satisfying, the indented keycaps provide a planted finger position, and the bottom row is easy to access thanks to the slope of the keycaps. The layout is quite compact, but I still found it manageable. The switches offer fast yet smooth performance, and hitting certain actuation points is easy thanks to their feel. It is a shame, however, there aren’t more settings available to emulate the analog control of a gamepad. Also, the wrist rest also cuts off abruptly with no downwards slope, so my palm hung off the edge awkwardly while in the WASD position. Without it, though, I found the keys were raised too high to reach without adopting a more fingertip-oriented position. Typing with the Apex Pro isn’t the best experience either. I personally prefer shallower keycaps, and I found gliding around on the Apex Pro awkward. There’s no doubt the Apex Pro is a premium piece of hardware, and it commands a premium price tag. It may not be as expensive as some of its rivals, such as the Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro 75%, but it runs close. There are cheaper gaming keyboards with analog switches, such as the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro, although this is wired only and can’t quite match the Apex Pro for performance. So if you’ve got the money to spend, the Apex Pro is hard to top for an analog keyboard. The Apex Pro costs $269 / £259 (about AU$456) and is available now in black only. It comes with a wrist pad and replacement keycaps can be purchased from SteelSeries’ website. A mini version is also available which loses the OLED screen, and a full-size variant adds a number pad as well as a larger scroll wheel and screen button. The Apex Pro sits atop the market in terms of price, eclipsing some of Razer’s best offerings, for instance. Although not quite as pricey as the BlackWidow V4 Pro 75%, it’s more expensive than the Huntsman V2 Analog, our pick as the best gaming keyboard. What sets that board apart is the 360-degree motion of the switches keys, letting you mimic an analog stick on a gamepad even more closely. It’s wired only, though. If you’re looking for another analog keyboard, then the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro is considerably less expensive than the Apex Pro. Although it’s wired only and has some issues with its analog implementation, the Vulcan 2 is still a worthy contender in the sector. Value: 3 / 5 The Apex Pro looks understated for a gaming keyboard. The totally black design is bereft of the brash trappings common in the sector, so at first glance you’ll struggle to identify its intended audience. The floating keycaps, though, are a giveaway, as is the opulent RGB lighting. There’s no denying the Apex Pro has a premium aura, though. It’s also substantial, with a thick, two-tiered chassis, but fortunately it isn’t as heavy as it looks. The build quality is impeccable, with every material, join and key feeling smooth and sturdy. The double-shot PBT keycaps are lightly textured and feel great under your fingers. They’re quite thick and sit high above the board, allowing for deep presses. If they aren’t to your liking, though, they can be swapped out, and a puller is included. The layout is also quite compact, which I had to get used to, but it didn’t take long to adapt. The wrist pad is similarly well-built yet pleasingly light, with a smooth rubberized layer that’s both durable and comfortable. It connects magnetically to the board itself, and although the connection is quite weak, it suffices. There are several default hotkeys on the Apex Pro, accessible with SteelSeries’ own modifier key, called the Meta key. These include global adjustments for the actuation point and rapid trigger function, as well changing profiles, recording macros, and switching between three Bluetooth devices. However, more detailed settings and customizations are available via the Engine tool within the GG software. All keys can be remapped, and can be set to trigger on press or release. There’s a good selection of actions, including profile switching, keyboard setting adjustments and app launching. There are also OS shortcuts that can be mapped, including a selection of media keys and copy and paste, but there aren’t many more than this; those in other peripheral software are more numerous. GG also allows you to set actuation points ranging from 0.1mm to 4mm for all main keys. You can also toggle rapid trigger for each individual key, which, as GG explains, dynamically alters the actuation point when spamming, allowing for rapid-twitch movements. It even has a dual binding mode, allowing a single key to have two different binds, depending on the primary and secondary actuation points of your choosing. For the most part, GG is easy to use with a clear layout and some explanations for various settings. However, it would’ve been nice to see some visual feedback when adjusting actuation points and rapid trigger modes, as some of the Apex Pro’s rivals offer with their own software. Nestled in the top right corner of the Apex Pro is a small monotone OLED screen, called the Smart Screen. It displays battery life by default, but can be customized in GG to display anything from your own images and GIFs, to system and in-game information. The options available for the latter are quite in depth. For instance, you can choose to display certain information at certain increments, and choose various screens to cycle through, each displaying their own unique information at various points. Supported games include Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, Minecraft, and League of Legends. There’s also a button on the screen that can be used to control media playback, such as play / pause and next / previous functions. You can enter a menu by holding this button down for a few seconds, from which more settings and functions are available: you can change the brightness of the RGB illumination, toggle between three of your connected Bluetooth devices, and change the global actuation point and rapid trigger functions. Navigation in this menu is achieved with the volume wheel acting as a scroller, and it’s responsive and effective. Design & features: 4 / 5 The gaming performance of the Apex Pro is excellent. The stock keycaps are nicely indented, allowing you to maintain a secure position, and presses are weighted just right, allowing for easy actuation that provides pleasant feedback. Reaching the CTRL key and spacebar is also easy, thanks to the slight incline of the keycaps. The switches are silky smooth and well lubed, offering plenty of clack without being too loud. I also found it relatively easy to hit certain actuation points, as the Hall-effect magnetic switches have more feel and resistance than others I’ve tried, such as those on the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro. This makes the Apex Pro ideal for rapid trigger functionality or dual binding. SteelSeries has also implemented a new Protection mode, which prevents keys adjacent to the intended one from accidentally triggering by reducing their sensitivity momentarily, which is a useful feature. Where it does miss a trick, however, is the ability to map the keys to an analog stick. This would make for smoother character movements and vehicle control, and is something that can be done with the aforementioned Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro, as well as the Razer Huntsman V2 Analog. As someone who prefers shallow keycaps for typing, I didn’t find the Apex Pro well suited for productivity purposes. Although adjusting the actuation point can help to prevent typos, the relatively thick keycaps and their deep indentations aren’t conducive to gliding around the board. The included wrist pad is pretty much essential for typing comfortably, as the thick body forces your wrists to bend awkwardly without one. Thankfully, the one included offers enough support and padding to make both typing and gaming more comfortable. The wrist pad can be more cumbersome when gaming, though. As the backend tails off abruptly with no slope, the area where your wrist meets your palm tends to overhang when in the WASD position, which is a strange and not entirely comfortable sensation. I did find that I could game without the pad, but I had to adapt my fingers so they were more perpendicular to the key caps, emphasizing more contact with the fingertips. If this is your preferred playing style anyway, then you shouldn’t have a problem. Steelseries claims a battery life of up 40 hours over Bluetooth, or 37.5 hours via the 2.4GHz dongle. During my tests I found this to be accurate, as I was able to get several days use out of it. Performance: 4.5 / 5 You want analog keysAnalog keys aren’t all that common, so if you want changeable sensitivity and rapid trigger functionality, this could be the board for you. You want top-tier performanceGaming with the Apex Pro is sublime, thanks to its smooth and fast performance. Actuation points are easy to hit and the rapid trigger works well. You’re on a budgetYou’ll be hard pressed to find many gaming keyboards that perform better than this, but it’ll cost you. You want controller emulationAlthough the switches are analog, you can’t emulate a gamepad’s triggers or analog sticks as you can with some other analog boards. Razer Huntsman V2 AnalogIf you must have an analog keyboard, then the Huntsman V2 Analog is another fine example in this category. Razer claims that the analog inputs can work with any controller-based game, allowing for ultra-smooth inputs. Uniquely, the keys also feature 360-degree movement, emulating a joystick more closely. The Huntsman V2 Analog can be had for slightly less than the Apex Pro, although if you hunt around you may be able to find a better deal. Read our Razer Huntsman V2 Analog review. Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL ProIf you still want analog switches but want to save even more cash, then the Vulcan 2 TKL Pro could fit the bill. It also lets you emulate the triggers and analog sticks of a gamepad, although the implementation isn’t as seamless as you might imagine. Still, it can have its uses. Read our Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro review. I tested the Apex Pro for about a week. During that time I used it for gaming, productivity and general use. I played various games, including Counter-Strike 2 and I Am Your Beast, which were useful for testing the actuation points and rapid trigger functionality. I also made sure to make use of every feature and function available via the GG software where possible. I have been PC gaming for over 10 years, and have experienced numerous keyboards during that time, spanning various switch types, key profiles, and form factors. I have also reviewed multiple gaming keyboards from a mixture of brands. Lewis Maddison is a Reviews Writer for TechRadar.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Crowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Fundamentals Are ‘Excellent,’ Praises CEO’s ‘Apology Tour’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 74 Jim Cramer was recently asked about Palo Alto Networks. He instead recommended Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as a better buy. ” Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell precipitously, almost 10% over a week, with nothing going on whatsoever. Therefore, that was a disparity with the fundamentals, which I think are excellent. The one to buy right now, at this moment, is Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), as it’s starting to bounce back. That’s the one now playing offense after we had George Kurtz, the CEO, visit 130 companies in 100 days as part of what you’d call the apology tour for what occurred in the third week of July. I really like that one better now.” Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “A non-benchmark stake in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) (-40%) was the biggest detractor among individual stocks. The shares of this cybersecurity platform provider fell precipitously in July, after a glitch in a CrowdStrike software update led to a global outage for many of its customers that, among other impacts, caused the mass cancellation of flights around the world. After bottoming out in early August, the stock made a partial rebound by quarter end, but we exited the fund’s holding during the summer.” Overall, CRWD ranks 5th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta, Amazon, McDonald’s: Marketing’s Role In The DEI Collapse

FILE - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the tech giant's Connect developer conference in Menlo ... [+] Park, Calif., Sept. 27, 2023. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File) When Meta announced the dismantling of its DEI initiatives last week, it marked a pivotal moment in corporate America. Following similar actions by Amazon, McDonald’s, Walmart, and Ford, Meta’s decision underscored a growing trend: companies stepping away from diversity programs once seen as moral and business imperatives. The fall of DEI isn’t just a reflection of its flaws — it’s a cautionary tale for marketers about the dangers of oversimplifying complex issues. Marketing doomed corporate DEI initiatives by overpromising transformation and underdelivering results, exposing structural flaws that left these programs vulnerable to criticism and collapse. While economic pressures, legal risks and cultural debates accelerated this retreat, the deeper issue lies within DEI itself. By focusing too narrowly on representation metrics and creating expectations that were nearly impossible to meet, DEI often fell short of addressing systemic inequities. Marketing’s role in amplifying these shortcomings further accelerated DEI’s decline. By elevating lofty promises without actionable results, marketers unintentionally highlighted the limitations of DEI — leaving it open to widespread skepticism. This reckoning leaves marketers and business leaders grappling with urgent questions: What went wrong with DEI? How can companies rebuild trust with stakeholders? And what frameworks can drive meaningful, sustainable change? These questions lie at the heart of this article and the broader discussion to come. From the beginning, DEI was a concept with structural weaknesses that made it difficult to implement meaningfully. While its goals were admirable, its execution left much to be desired. For many organizations, DEI became synonymous with increasing demographic diversity. While representation is an important component of equity, it’s not the whole picture. DEI programs measured success by demographic counts but ignored systemic issues like pay inequities or biased workplace culture. A 2019 study published in the Harvard Business Review found that while 75% of companies conducted unconscious bias training as part of their DEI efforts, only 25% reported any measurable improvements in workplace equity or inclusion metrics. Similarly, a 2022 report by the Society for Human Resource Management highlighted that most DEI programs failed to close pay gaps or address structural inequities, emphasizing the need for deeper systemic change. While DEI was framed as a moral imperative, its return on investment was rarely clear. Leaders struggled to connect representation or training programs to tangible business outcomes like productivity, innovation, or employee satisfaction. Without this clarity, DEI became an easy target during times of economic belt-tightening. DEI often positioned itself as a solution to deep social problems, but its prescriptive and moralistic tone alienated some employees and customers. Instead of cultivating inclusion, DEI messaging often deepened divides, as critics viewed it as tokenistic or overly political. At its core, DEI focused too narrowly on representation without addressing universal human needs — such as belonging (feeling part of a community), security (physical and psychological safety), and empowerment (having the tools and autonomy to thrive) — that are essential for cultivating trust, connection, and engagement across stakeholders. Marketing played a crucial role in turning DEI into a public-facing initiative, but in doing so, it also exposed the framework’s shortcomings. Poorly executed campaigns often exacerbated the perception that DEI was superficial or performative, undermining its credibility. Marketers often elevated DEI as a transformative solution. But when companies failed to back these promises with meaningful action, the messaging rang hollow. Amazon promoted its commitment to workforce diversity through marketing campaigns and public updates, but reports of inequities in warehouse conditions and a lack of diversity in leadership revealed a disconnect between its messaging and reality. Many campaigns relied on surface-level symbolism—like diverse imagery or token representation—without addressing systemic issues. The Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad, which trivialized the Black Lives Matter movement, became a lightning rod for criticism because it highlighted the disconnect between corporate intentions and public perception. Similarly, Heineken faced backlash for a tone-deaf ad that seemed to imply ‘lighter is better,’ while H&M drew outrage for featuring a Black child in a hoodie labeled ‘Coolest Monkey in the Jungle. By reducing complex social issues to easily digestible slogans, marketing often made DEI feel shallow. These campaigns ignored the nuances of inclusion, creating skepticism from both employees and consumers. Starbucks’ 2015 ‘Race Together’ campaign, which encouraged baristas to start conversations about race with customers, was widely criticized as naïve and performative. In focusing on surface-level identity over substance, marketers missed the opportunity to address consumers’ functional, emotional, and social needs holistically. By 2024, the corporate retreat from DEI was in full swing, driven by a combination of external pressures and internal failures. The fallout exposed deep flaws in the framework, as well as the dangers of superficial marketing efforts tied to it. Layoffs in DEI departments became widespread as companies faced economic headwinds. At the same time, the legal risks associated with affirmative action and diversity quotas, compounded by the shifting political landscape after the contentious 2024 elections, made these initiatives less appealing to executives. Without clear business outcomes to justify DEI’s continuation, it became an easy target for budget cuts. As DEI programs faltered, employees became disillusioned. They saw little progress in areas like pay equity or career advancement, leading to disengagement. At the same time, consumers grew wary of performative gestures and empty promises. The disconnect between internal practices and external marketing left both groups feeling betrayed. A 2024 report by Edelman highlighted that 63% of employees felt their company’s public-facing DEI messaging did not reflect their internal workplace experiences, while 58% of consumers expressed distrust toward brands that failed to show tangible progress on equity initiatives. The public dismantling of DEI programs by major corporations like Meta, Amazon, McDonald’s, Walmart and Ford is emblematic of the broader retreat — feeding perceptions that corporate commitments to diversity and inclusion are fragile. This backlash underscores a key takeaway for marketers and business leaders: initiatives that fail to deliver meaningful results risk alienating their audiences. To move forward, marketers must rethink their approach to addressing societal challenges and adopt frameworks that prioritize authenticity, systemic change, and universal human needs. DEI’s downfall illustrates the risk of reducing systemic issues to branding exercises. Marketers must avoid turning social challenges into shallow campaigns and instead focus on aligning messaging with meaningful internal action. Marketing efforts should reflect internal realities. Before launching campaigns, companies must align messaging with internal practices, like pay equity and workplace culture. When the internal foundation is strong, external efforts resonate more deeply with audiences. The future of corporate responsibility isn’t about hitting representation targets—it’s about addressing universal human needs like belonging, trust, and well-being. By focusing on systemic outcomes rather than identity-based metrics, marketers can create campaigns that resonate broadly and drive real impact. DEI’s demise wasn’t inevitable, but it was predictable. Structural flaws and poorly executed marketing turned a promising idea into a polarizing and ineffective framework. For marketers, this is a moment of reckoning — not just to avoid the mistakes of DEI, but to redefine how businesses tackle societal challenges. Marketing doomed corporate DEI by overpromising transformation and delivering superficial results. The way forward isn’t about abandoning the ideals behind DEI, but evolving them into frameworks that drive real impact. This shift is critical — not just for connecting with consumers, but for creating workplaces and communities where everyone can thrive. DEI may be dead, but its lessons offer marketers a blueprint for building trust and driving meaningful impact. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta has absolutely no clue what to do with AI

But it really wants in. Here’s why Meta is jamming AI into everything When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has managed to cause controversy with its AI push yet again, after Instagram started showing users AI-generated pictures of themselves in their feeds. Shortly after redditor u/Green_Video_9831 used Meta AI to edit a selfie with Instagram’s 'Imagine Me' feature, he was startled to find his own face staring back at him from an AI-generated hall of mirrors in a targeted post on his feed. It seems that the company that recently brought you fake Instagram profiles, and fake Facebook chatbots of fake celebrities is now crossing new frontiers by bringing you a fake… you. When it was posted to the subreddit r/ABoringDystopia, the story quickly went viral, with users piling on scorn and disgust. When I saw this story, I was alarmed by the revolting tackiness of it all, but I wasn’t surprised. A very clear pattern has emerged in Meta’s behaviour – the company is going all-in on AI, but has no real idea what to do with it, what users want from it, or – crucially – how to make any money off it. But the war to be the best social media platform grinds on, shareholders demand their quarterly treats, and AI is still the hottest buzzword on the block. So, Meta is jamming AI into everything, throwing it all at the wall in the desperate hope that something, anything, manages to stick. I might be wrong, and if that’s the case then I encourage Mark Zuckerberg to come down here and community note my ass. But I don’t think I am. There’s a cycle that’s been playing out for literal years at this point: 1. Meta announces a big, splashy new AI feature 2. Users either revolt, make fun of it, or simply ignore it. 3. Meta quietly retires the feature. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. 4. Go to 1. By far the biggest boondoggle so far has been the aforementioned celebrity AI chatbots. I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve already forgotten about it, so here’s a refresher. In late 2023, Meta announced that it would be bringing a host of AI assistant chatbots featuring various famous faces. Users would be able to have their questions answered by the likes of Snoop Dogg, MrBeast, Paris Hilton, Kendall Jenner and more. And where are they now, you ask? The whole thing was a disaster, users hated it, and the chatbots were boxed within less than a year. I never even saw them, because they were nixed before launching in the UK. It’s easy just to dismiss this whole sorry episode as another of Meta’s silly failed ventures – another Metaverse fashion week. But just think for a moment about how much it must have cost. One thing that unites Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, MrBeast and Kendall Jenner is that while they can be bought easily, they cannot be bought cheaply. And there were twenty-eight such celebs in this thing! Even at the most conservative estimates, it must have cost tens of millions, for absolutely zero return. I confidently predict that this latest feature – the ‘Imagined for You’ selfies that put u/Green_Video_9831 into a hall of mirrors – is going to go the exact same way. I’m not blind to the cute novelty factor of it – I’m sure you can imagine yourself enjoying seeing a pretty realistic-looking photo of yourself on the surface of Mars or in Blade Runner or whatever. But can you imagine yourself enjoying that more than once or twice? Can you imagine enjoying that on a regular enough basis that it significantly juices Meta’s engagement metrics? Can you imagine yourself paying for it? Even when you’re not paying Snoop Dogg money, generative AI is not a cheap technology. Those godawful fake Instagram profiles (remember Liv, the "proud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller”?) were not cheap to make, none of it is, and I firmly believe that Meta has no path to profitability with this stuff. If this all feels like a flailing tech giant desperately seeking to stay on top of the pile by burning money to over-leverage on underdeveloped technology that can’t really do the things they’re saying it can do – well, that’s because it is. And sure, Meta has a lot of money to burn. But nothing is infinite. At some point, they're going to hit the limits of what they can spend on this stuff without making any return. What comes after that? I don't know! I don't think Meta knows either, and I think the company is really, really hoping that it doesn't have to find out. Still, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe in six months’ time we’ll all be Imagining Ourselves in halls of mirrors all day and all night. Indeed, it’s entirely possible that Meta knows exactly what it is doing with AI and is just about to announce the one killer AI app that everybody simply has to have. I’m sure that’s just around the corner – but for now, I’m off to jack into the metaverse (now with legs) and check on the value of my Instagram NFT. I’m sure they’re both doing great.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares dipped 3% in pre-trading on Monday, which would technically put them on the cusp of entering correction territory after a 10% drop from recent highs. The slide reveals bigger headwinds in the broader market, stemming from rising Treasury yields and innovative U.S. export restrictions on AI technologies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The Biden administration's new rules ban the export of AI tech to countries like Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and the UAEwith China, Russia, and others still barred. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said preserving U.S. dominance in AI development and chip design was a key reason. Nvidia strongly criticized the restrictions, describing them as a 'regulatory morass' preventing American innovation. In a blog post, the vice president of the company's government affairs, Ned Finkle, accused the administration of stifling competition and risking losing the Edge on the nation's technology. Nvidia gets 40% of its revenue in the U.S. and 15% each from Taiwan and China. HSBC analyst Frank Lee also cut his price target to $185 a share but maintained a 'buy.' Lee said Nvidia's potential headwinds in the first half of its fiscal year, beginning February, may necessitate a stronger second half performance to meet expectations. Lee also lowered Nvidia's expected data centre revenue for the fiscal year to $236 billion from $253 billion and cut the company's sales estimates on the NVL 72 AI server racks to 220k. However, Lee said Nvidia still beats Wall Street consensus to beat earnings per share in the most likely bear case scenario. All those regulatory shifts and blunted analyst tips have made Nvidia generally caution about this near-term growth. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Nvidia can't wait for Trump as it bashes Biden's 'misguided' AI rules — and the stock falls

Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) on Monday quickly slammed newly released Biden administration rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” But Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Nvidia stock fell almost 3% in pre-market trading Monday. Under the new guidelines, 18 key U.S. allies and partners would not be affected by the restrictions. Companies that meet high security and trust standards set by the U.S., and are headquartered in countries that are considered close allies and partners, would have the chance to obtain “Universal Verified End User” (UVEU) status. This designation would allow them to locate parts of their computational power in allied countries, and buy up to 320,000 advanced GPUs over the next two years. Nvidia argued that these controls are an overreach, and would “do nothing to enhance U.S. security.” “Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” Finkle said. At the same time, Finkle praised the first Trump administration for laying “the foundation for America’s current strength and success in AI, fostering an environment where U.S. industry could compete and win on merit without compromising national security.” With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in exactly one week, Big Tech leaders from Google (GOOGL+3.23%) chief Sundar Pichai to Meta (META+4.31%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been cozying up to Trump. They’re hoping to benefit from favorable policies, more lax regulation, and a pro-innovation environment that they hope will allow them to go full steam ahead on their AI ambitions — and beyond. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang himself said last week week that he’s ready to meet with the incoming Trump administration to help with AI policy. “I’d be delighted to go see him and congratulate him, and do whatever we can to make this administration succeed,” Huang told Bloomberg Television about Trump. He added that he has not yet been invited to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Sonos CEO Patrick Spence steps down after disastrous app launch
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342179/sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-resignation-reason-app
Time Published: 2025-01-13T13:00:00Z

By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is resigning from the job today, effective immediately, with board member Tom Conrad filling the role of interim CEO. It’s the most dramatic development yet in an eight-month saga that has proven to be the most challenging time in Sonos’ history. The company’s decision to prematurely release a buggy, completely overhauled new app back in May — with crucial features missing at launch — outraged customers and kicked off a monthslong domino effect that included layoffs, a sharp decline in employee morale, and a public apology tour. The Sonos Ace headphones, rumored to be the whole reason behind the hurried app, were immediately overshadowed by the controversy, and my sources tell me that sales numbers remain dismal. Sonos’ community forums and subreddit have been dominated by complaints and an overwhelmingly negative sentiment since the spring. In October, Sonos tried to get a handle on the situation, which, by then, had spiraled into a full-on PR disaster, by outlining a turnaround plan. The company vowed to strengthen product development principles, increase transparency internally, and take other steps that it said would prevent any mistake of this magnitude from ever happening again. I can also report for the first time that Sonos hired a crisis management public relations firm to help navigate the ordeal. But three months later, Sonos’ board of directors and Spence have concluded that those steps weren’t enough: the app debacle has officially cost Spence his job. No other changes are being made today, however. So for now, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, who some employees have privately told me deserves a fair share of the blame for recent missteps, will remain in his role. “We’re going to initiate a search for the next CEO, and we’ll work on finding a leader who’s going to continue to build on our legacy and work with the team to move the company forward,” Sonos spokesperson Erin Pategas told me by phone on Sunday afternoon. She described the leadership change as “turning a page on the chapter that we’re in and forging a path ahead that gets us in the direction that we want to be going for ourselves and our customers.” In case you were wondering, that direction will not include a return to the old Sonos app; Pategas said the company remains fully committed to the new software, which has received a slew of bug fixes and gradually added back previous features over the last several months. It’s gotten better, but even this far along, complaints remain about speakers randomly vanishing from the app and other problems. Spence joined Sonos in 2012 as chief commercial officer. As CEO, he oversaw a wide range of successful hardware products: Sonos released several impressive soundbars (including the still-new Arc Ultra), pushed into portable audio with the Move and Roam, and debuted the forward-looking Era 300 spatial audio speaker. But the app stumbles — and Spence’s failure to apologize in the immediate aftermath — ultimately soured his reputation with the company’s most loyal customers. There was no overcoming that. Spence will technically remain with Sonos until June 30th of this year, during which time he’ll receive a base salary of $7,500 per month for providing the company with “strategic advisory services.” And when that end date rolls around, he’ll be granted a severance of $1,875,000. Those numbers come from an 8K filing that Sonos made with the SEC regarding today’s news. In my time at The Verge, I’ve covered Sonos more comprehensively (and I’d like to think fairly) than any other company. Yes, that includes a long list of product leaks, but I’m far more interested in shining a light on all the frustrations caused by the new app — both for customers and staff — and the bad decisions that led Sonos off the tracks. Those choices have had repercussions for ordinary employees who gave their best to the brand. If you have more to share about the last year at Sonos, please reach out to me confidentially and securely over Signal at (845) 445-8455 or chriswelch.01. I can also be reached via DM on Bluesky, X, or Instagram. It now falls on Conrad, who joined the Sonos board in 2017, to rally disenchanted employees and make good on winning back consumer trust. Conrad’s career includes a 10-year tenure as chief technology officer at Pandora and two years as VP of product at Snapchat. He worked on Apple’s Finder software during the ’90s. Most recently, Conrad served as chief product officer for the ill-fated Quibi streaming service. Pategas believes he’s a great fit for the interim CEO position because he’s keenly aware of the company’s current predicament; Conrad and chief innovation officer Nick Millington have already been spearheading Sonos’ fix-the-app effort for months. Despite this seismic shift at the top, Sonos’ future product pipeline remains “full steam ahead,” Pategas told me. The company’s next major new product is rumored to be a streaming video player, which would pit it against the likes of Apple, Roku, Amazon, and Google in the living room. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Is MicroStrategy Buying More Bitcoin? Here’s How It Could Impact the Best Wallet Token Presale

More green dots have appeared on MicroStrategy’s portfolio tracker. For context, every green dot signals a Bitcoin ($BTC) purchase – of which there have been at least six since December. Michael Saylor announced the last purchase worth $101M on January 6, which brought MicroStrategy’s $BTC Yield to 74.3% in 2024. Yesterday, Saylor posted the Bitcoin BTC$91,214 tracker for the 10th consecutive week, signaling another possible Bitcoin purchase. MicroStrategy’s current $BTC holdings amount to $42.24B, and, according to Saylor’s X account, he’s ‘thinking about the next green dot.’ Despite Saylor’s continued confidence and a long-term bullish outlook, $BTC is facing some strong headwinds right now, trading at $91.3K. Some analysts say Trump’s tariff plans could be at fault, while better employment rates in the US and a stronger dollar have also put pressure on crypto trades. Saylor made a name for himself as a devoted $BTC HODLer. And his faith in $BTC certainly appears to be paying off for MicroStrategy. After all, MSTR stock price grew 468% year-to-date and 2,185% since the company started acquiring crypto. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock price is now so closely correlated with the $BTC value that we can safely call it a ‘$BTC-indexed company’ or a ‘$BTC-correlated investment vehicle.’ This means that a sudden decline in $BTC’s price could decimate MicroStrategy’s shares. Yet, this scenario is unlikely in the upcoming year, given the ongoing bull run and growing institutional adoption of crypto. Saylor recently also gave a 44-slide pitch on why Microsoft should invest $100B yearly on $BTC. We don’t know if Microsoft’s board of directors took Saylor’s advice, but his points were compelling. Saylor argues that by doing so, MSFT stock could add $5T in market cap. Against all expectations, the $BTC rally following Trump’s election victory was short-lived. Instead of hitting $150K, $BTC dipped to $90K. The sharp correction likely results from a stronger dollar, improving employment figures in the US, along with some FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). Indeed, some experts believe uncertainty over Trump’s new economic policies may have also contributed to this downturn. That’s because Frump’s tariffs could further strengthen the dollar. And whenever the dollar strengthens, investor risk appetite weakens. Also, the Fed has no reason to lower interest rates now, after it already cut them by 25 basis points in December. By all accounts, we can expect riskier assets to be on a bumpy ride in the short term, but volatility is nothing new for crypto, and seasoned investors like Saylor know to buy the dip. All of the above draws us to one conclusion – HODL ’til things look up. Whether you want to play it safe with $BTC or invest in new promising projects with potentially higher returns, Best Wallet offers an easy entry into the crypto market. This multi-chain wallet’s standout feature is the presale aggregator, which gives users early access to hot new tokens, including meme coins like $WEPE and $SOLX. Its native token $BEST is now also on presale, with over $7M raised in just a couple of months. $BEST holders will gain governance rights, lower transaction fees, and higher yields in Best Wallet’s staking aggregator. One $BEST now costs $0.023575, but the price will increase in 16 hours. This means now is the last chance to join the Best Wallet ecosystem at the lowest possible price and maximize your profits when the bull run starts up again. It’s easy to criticize MicroStrategy’s investment strategy as reckless, but the results to date speak for themselves. Even if a stronger dollar and Trump’s economic agenda put temporary pressure on the crypto market, the long-term outlook remains bullish. Still, as always, we remind you to DYOR and diversify your portfolio because risk management is critical in every investment. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq sink amid dashed hopes for 2025 rate cuts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led a slide in US stock futures on Monday, while the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest-rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation report. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) sank 0.8%, while those on the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) tumbled 1.2%. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.3%. Stocks are shaping up for another rough session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report has rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading close to 4.8%, and the 30-year yield (^TYX) neared 5% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X) in particular coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Adding to the gloom, oil prices rose around 2% to their highest levels in five months after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry than expected, risking supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to over $81 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) changed hands above $78. On the corporate front, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid as all the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps lost ground in the market turmoil. Europe's largest pension fund revealed that it sold its entire stake in Tesla over CEO Elon Musk's pay package. Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. In focus remains the rise in yields and now, the rise in energy prices. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, pre-market weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Notable Business Negotiations of 2024

PON – Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School - https://www.pon.harvard.edu By Katie Shonk — on January 13th, 2025 / Business Negotiations For corporate dealmakers, 2024 was a relatively slow year. Yet several notable business negotiations and conflict resolution decisions captured headlines and offered lessons for negotiators across sectors. Let’s take a look at 10 that stood out: Discover step-by-step techniques for avoiding common business negotiation pitfalls when you download a copy of the FREE special report, Business Negotiation Strategies: How to Negotiate Better Business Deals, from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. 10. A failed succession plan. In December, a Nevada commissioner ruled against media mogul Rupert Murdoch in his efforts to cement control of his family trust with his eldest son, Lachlan. According to the commissioner, Edmund J. Gorman Jr., Murdoch and Lachlan acted in “bad faith” in their attempt to alter the irrevocable trust, which will divide control of Murdoch’s empire among his four oldest children—Lachlan, James, Elisabeth, and Prudence—upon his death. Murdoch, 93, was motivated to elevate Lachlan to a permanent leadership role to ensure that his media holdings will maintain their conservative bent. In December, Murdoch launched a long-shot effort to overturn the ruling. 9. Salaries lag in WNBA. Interest in women’s basketball has skyrocketed in recent years, thanks to the rise of superstar Caitlin Clark and other top players. Yet many were surprised to hear that Clark’s starting salary in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) is only about $76,500, a small fraction of what male players earn in the NBA. While Clark earns the bulk of her income from endorsements, many WNBA players supplement their relatively low salaries by playing on foreign teams in the offseason. As profits rise in women’s basketball, it will become more difficult for WNBA teams to continue to justify low salaries. It’s one of many fields in which women face an uphill battle in salary negotiations. 8. Taking the salty with the sweet. In August, chocolate-maker Mars announced a planned $35.9 billion acquisition of snack-maker Kellanova, whose brands include Cheez-It, Pringles, and Eggo. Privately owned Mars, which produces M&M’s and Snickers candy bars, has been expanding beyond its core business with recent acquisitions, including the maker of KIND bars and pet food brand IAMS. The diversification deal comes amid volatility in the food market, as some consumers resist recent rises in grocery prices. 7. Boeing’s troubles mount. Boeing’s ongoing business and ethical crisis was exacerbated by a seven-week strike by 33,000 of its machinists in 2024. With the union workers on the picket lines, Boeing halted production of its 737, 777, and 767 jets at an estimated cost of $5 billion. The workers went on strike after rejecting a contract that promised a 25% pay raise over four years. After threatening mass layoffs, Boeing, led by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, ultimately offered the machinists a pay hike of 38% over four years. A majority of the workers voted to ratify the new contract. At year’s end, strikes by Amazon and Starbucks workers further highlighted workers’ attempts to gain leverage through collective action. 6. Upscale retail consolidates. Two 2024 deals aimed to help pull the luxury retail market out of its downward slide amid competition from fast-fashion leaders Walmart, Amazon, and others. In July, HBC, the parent company of department store Saks Fifth Avenue, agreed to acquire Neiman Marcus, which had filed for bankruptcy protection during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Times reports. The acquisition positions the new retail group, Saks Global, as the industry leader, with a total of 74 stores and 100 outlets. And in December, the Nordstrom family and a Mexican retail group cemented a $6.25 billion deal to purchase department store Nordstrom and take it private. With sales at Nordstrom having “flatlined” in the past decade, according to the Associated Press, the new owners plan to invest in the business without the pressure to show short-term profits. 5. Google under fire. In August, a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and 18 U.S. states that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly with its online search engine. Then in December, to open up Google’s Android app store to increased competition, Judge James Donato ordered Google to allow app developers to offer their own app stores on Android devices in exchange for a “reasonable fee.” The landmark decision could trigger a wave of antitrust lawsuits against tech companies. 4. Mixing business and politics. The rich and the powerful exerted their influence throughout the long and tumultuous U.S. presidential election of 2024. After Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance opposite Donald Trump on June 27, Democratic politicians, business leaders, and movie stars worked behind the scenes and in front of the camera to try to convince the president to bow out of the race. While their negotiation campaign succeeded, the switch in candidates to Kamala Harris failed to deliver Democrats a victory. After Trump was reelected, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of his biggest donors, and other Silicon Valley leaders successfully jockeyed to secure high-level positions in his administration. 3. An up-and-down media deal. In July, Paramount Global agreed to merge with entertainment studio Skydance in what DealBook called “the most tumultuous media deal in years.” Paramount’s business, which includes CBS and Viacom, had been on a “roller coaster” brought on by the loss of cable customers and significant debt, according to CNBC. On-again, off-again negotiations with Skydance culminated in an $8.4 billion deal, backed by private equity firms. The merger negotiations raised the issue of when to agree to an exclusivity period. 2. AI investments. In 2024, tech companies jostled to bring artificial intelligence (AI) tools to market. Amazon invested $12 billion in generative AI start-up Anthropic over 14 months, and Apple and Nvidia were in talks to back OpenAI as part of a deal that valued the AI leader at $100 billion. U.S. regulators are looking closely at the investments, which allow tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google to “form deep ties with their smaller rivals while avoiding most government scrutiny,” according to the Times. But the White House actually played matchmaker in one deal, pushing Microsoft to invest $1.5 billion in G42 after the Emirati AI company agreed to try to keep Chinese intelligence agencies from infiltrating its systems. 1. A sluggish year for mergers. Merger and acquisition (M&A) deals fell 18% in 2024, even as the dollar volume of deals rose 9% to $3 trillion, the London Stock Exchange Group reports. High interest rates and inflation kept deal financing costs high, and the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) tough antitrust enforcement put a damper on dealmaking. Court rulings blocked the merger of JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines, as well as Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of rival grocery chain Albertsons. Corporate dealmakers anticipated that Trump’s pick for FTC chief, Andrew Ferguson, would take a more hands-off approach to M&A negotiations than his predecessor, Lina Khan, though Ferguson is expected to crack down on Big Tech, DealBook reports.

Title: TSMC fourth-quarter profit seen jumping 58% amid strong AI chip demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Faith Hung TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 58% leap in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday because of surging demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from the megatrend towards AI. But the Taiwanese company faces headwinds from U.S. government technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$377.95 billion ($11.41 billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 fourth-quarter net profit of T$238.7 billion. TSMC last week reported a jump in fourth-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, comfortably beating market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. Brett Simpson, Arete Research co-founder and senior analyst, said 2025 will be another year where TSMC's growth is largely driven by AI customers. "From the U.S. government perspective, Arete is optimistic that TSMC can build a good relationship with the new administration particularly given its new fab cluster in Arizona is the biggest foreign direct investment project in the U.S. at present," he added. TSMC is spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. Edward Chen, chairman of Fubon Financial's securities investment unit, said progress on the Arizona fab and its yield rates, or the percentage of usable chips, would be crucial for the company. "Additionally, the impact of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration on demand remains to be seen," he added. TSMC, at its earnings call, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure as it races to expand production. On its last earnings call in October, TSMC said capital expenditure was likely to be higher in 2025 than last year, though it did not provide a figure. On the call, it predicted 2024 capital expenditure as being slightly higher than $30 billion. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock soaring 81% last year, compared with a 28.5% gain for the broader market.

Posted on 01/12/2025 8:31:25 AM PST by wildcard_redneck In a stunning reversal, the tech industry—once the unstoppable engine of modern innovation—has laid off over 124,000 workers in 2024 alone. What’s driving this wave of layoffs, and what does it mean for the future of work in one of the world’s most dynamic sectors? The Layoff Landscape In August 2024, Intel sent shockwaves through the market by announcing a 15% reduction in its global workforce—roughly 15,000 jobs. Just days later, Cisco Systems announced plans to lay off 7% of its employees, marking its second round of job cuts this year as the company shifts focus to rapidly growing areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Earlier in February 2024, Cisco laid off more than 4,000 employees. These are not isolated incidents. According to Layoffs.fyi, 384 tech companies have laid off more than 124,000 employees in 2024, adding to the 428,449 tech workers who lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023. While the broader labor market has shown some resilience, the tech sector's cuts are particularly visible due to the sheer scale of these companies. Even a small percentage reduction translates to thousands of lives and families upended. (Excerpt) Read more at forbes.com ...

In this country they fired mainly Americans and yet they're still importing H1B visa indentured servants like crazy. It is colonization and ethnic replacement by our own federal government and multinational corporations that bribe politicians for the privilege of replacing native born Americans of all colors with cheap indentured servants. It needs to end. 1 posted on 01/12/2025 8:31:25 AM PST by wildcard_redneck [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: wildcard_redneck Concur. 2 posted on 01/12/2025 8:35:07 AM PST by grey_whiskers (The opinions are solely those of the author and are subject to change without notice.)

Title: Jim Cramer Says Dell Technologies (DELL) Has ‘A Lot Of Upside’ If You Have Patience

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). Here is what he said: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) did not have a good quarter. It really was a disappointing quarter. I agree with people, even though I think the world of Michael Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). However, I think Dell’s second half will be much better. I do not think much of its first half. If you have the patience to own the stock here, I don’t think there’s a lot of downside, and I think there’s a lot of upside. However, we own other stocks in the portfolio that I think are better, even at this price. Do you know that I actually like Nvidia at 134 more than I like Dell? Just saying.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company’s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.” Overall, DELL ranks 7th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: S&P’s $18 trillion rally threatened by psychology of 5% yields

Time Published: 2025-01-12T13:00:07Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%. Most Read from Bloomberg A Blueprint for Better Bike Lanes What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco Ambitious High-Speed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region New York, San Francisco Ranked Worst for US Traffic in City Centers Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. “It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added. Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007. “If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.” The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election. Building Barriers While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time. “Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.” Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds. The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration. “When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said. What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in. “The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.” Red Flags The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position. “When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.” One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. “Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.” That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500. At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. “The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek He Built Russia’s Biggest Tech Company.

In these shaky times, investors can enhance their portfolio returns by adding stocks backed by solid financials and long-term growth opportunities. The investment thesis of top Wall Street analysts can inform investors as they pick the right stocks, as pros base their analysis on a strong understanding of the macro environment and company-specific factors. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their performance. We start with ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the third quarter of 2024, though gross bookings fell short of expectations. Recently, Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated a buy rating on Uber Technologies stock with a price target of $90. The analyst sees 2025 as a year of investment for UBER. While these investments could impact the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the near term, they are expected to fuel long-term growth. Based on his analysis, Lee expects Uber's growth investments to drive a compound annual growth rate of 16% in core gross bookings from FY23 to FY26, in line with the company's analyst-day target of mid- to high-teens growth. The analyst is confident that Uber's EBITDA growth is on track with its analyst-day target of high-30s to 40% CAGR. "Despite leaning into growth investments, economies of scale and increased efficiency should offset margin risks," said Lee. Additionally, Lee thinks that worries over the growth of the company's Mobility business seem overstated. The analyst expects FY25 gross bookings growth (forex neutral) in the high-teens, with the pace of deceleration moderating compared to the second half of 2024. Further, the analyst projects the gross bookings for Uber's Delivery business to remain in the mid-teens in FY25. This increase is expected to be supported by the growing adoption of new verticals while maintaining the food delivery market share. The analyst added that Mizuho's checks revealed that order frequency has reached another all-time high. Checks also indicate solid grocery adoption in the U.S., Canada and Mexico along with robust user penetration. Lee ranks No. 324 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Charts on TipRanks. We move to Datadog (DDOG), a company that offers cloud monitoring and security products. In November, the company announced better-than-anticipated results for the third quarter of 2024. On Jan. 6, Monness analyst Brian White reiterated a buy rating on Datadog stock with a price target of $155. The analyst thinks that the company has a more balanced approach toward the generative artificial intelligence trend, "avoiding the absurd claims propagated by many across the software complex." He noted that DDOG fared well compared to its peers in a challenging software backdrop in 2024, but added that it lagged behind other stocks in Monness' coverage universe. That said, White thinks that Datadog, and the broader industry, will start to see incremental activity over the next 12 to 18 months from the long-term boom in generative AI. Highlighting DDOG's outperformance compared to peers and its transparency with regard to its generative AI progress, the analyst noted that AI-native customers accounted for more than 6% of the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) in Q3 2024, up from over 4% in Q2 2024 and 2.5% in Q3 2023. White also highlighted some of the company's AI offerings, including LLM Observability and its gen AI assistant, Bits AI. Overall, the analyst is bullish on Datadog and thinks that the stock deserves a premium valuation compared to traditional software vendors due to its cloud-native platform, rapid growth and robust secular tailwinds in the observability space, as well as its new generative AI-led growth opportunities. White ranks No. 33 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Datadog Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is this week's third stock pick. The company is considered one of the major beneficiaries of the generative AI wave and is experiencing stellar demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required to build and run AI models. Following a fireside chat with Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $170. The analyst highlighted the CFO's assurance that the ramp-up in the production of the company's Blackwell platform is on track despite supply chain challenges, thanks to solid execution. Moreover, the company expects spending in the data center space to remain strong in calendar year 2025, supported by the Blackwell ramp-up and broad-based strength in demand. Further, Sur noted that management sees massive revenue growth opportunities, as it grabs a larger chunk of the $1 trillion-worth datacenter infrastructure installed base. Sur added that Nvidia expects to benefit from the shift to accelerated computing and growing demand for AI solutions. Management thinks that the company has a solid competitive advantage compared to ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) solutions due to several strengths, including ease of adoption and its comprehensive system solutions. Agreeing with this viewpoint, Sur said, "We believe that enterprise, vertical markets, and sovereign customers, will continue to prefer Nvidia-based solutions." Among the other key takeaways, Sur highlighted the rollout of next-generation gaming products and opportunities to expand beyond high-end gaming into markets like AI PCs. Sur ranks No. 35 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.9%.

In fact, for all of India, more jobs are being created,” Chandok added. There have been reports of the company cutting a small percentage (less than 1 per cent) of jobs across departments globally, based on performance. The company has around 20,000 employees in India, out of a total of 2,28,000 people worldwide. Microsoft’s latest job cuts are lower compared to past downsizing exercises. The company laid off 10,000 employees in early 2023. In January 2024, the company’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap, just three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. The news of job cuts started doing the rounds during the recent two-day visit to India by Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft. Nadella announced his company’s $3 billion investment plans for cloud and AI infrastructure over the next two years. “India is rapidly becoming a leader in AI innovation, unlocking new opportunities across the country,” Nadella had said, adding that the investments in infrastructure and skilling that he announced reaffirmed Microsoft’s commitment to making India AI-first. He said the company aims to build a thriving AI ecosystem in India by supporting the government and industry in fostering AI innovation and enhancing productivity, efficiency, and accessibility. For the same purpose, Microsoft tied up with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) under the IndiaAI Mission and also announced partnerships with companies like RailTel, Apollo Hospitals, Bajaj Finserv, Mahindra Group, and upGrad to accelerate AI-driven transformations in India. “We will continue to use AI to unlock possibilities for the next few decades and ensure that communities across the country have access to the compute they need to prosper in the AI era,” Chandok added. In 2023, not only Microsoft but other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Accenture, and Dell also announced job cuts of 10,000, 27,000, 19,000, and 6,650, respectively.

The stock market has yet to gain momentum in 2025. With Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th drawing near, all eyes are on how investors will react this week, as it carries its own significance with key earnings reports and the much-anticipated inflation data release, which is expected to stay high. Moreover, the recent job data was better than anticipated, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may postpone its decision to cut interest rates. These reports will provide a foundation for the Trump 2.0 era, as the latest inflation and employment figures will give insights into the economic challenges and opportunities that his administration will encounter. With that context, let’s dive into what this week has in store. This week, the pace picks up in the second half with a flurry of banking earnings reports. On Wednesday, banking heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%), BlackRock (BLK+5.38%), Citigroup (C+7.07%), and others are set to release their earnings before the opening bell. Thursday will follow with reports from M&T Bank Corporation (MTB+2.36%), Morgan Stanley (MS+5.29%), and other financial giants. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+2.56%) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH+0.16%) will unveil their financial performance on the same day, offering key insights into health insurance and chip sectors. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data will be released. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Additionally, the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book, a detailed compilation of economic conditions from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. This report often offers valuable clues regarding the Fed’s stance on inflation, employment trends, and broader economic growth. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, initial jobless claims data will be released, providing a glimpse into the health of the labor market. Additionally, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will also be published. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth.

Title: Jobs Report: Bond Yields Rise And Stocks Fall
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/12/jobs-report-bond-yields-rise-and-stocks-fall/
Time Published: 2025-01-12T12:00:00Z

The U.S. economy shows positive momentum, with robust job growth in last Friday's payrolls report. ... [+] The resilient growth removes almost any chance of another Federal Reserve rate cut soon. The robust and much higher-than-expected employment growth in the December jobs report on Friday essentially wiped out any thoughts of another Federal Reserve rate cut on January 29. Job growth continued to bounce back from the hurricanes and strike-impacted October data. The economy entered 2025 with some momentum, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 2.7% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 256,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, but not enough to diminish the strong report. The household survey data was even more impressive, with a gain of 478,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 102,000. Monthly Job Growth Wage growth was a little below expectations at 3.9% year-over-year, down from 4.0% last month. The average workweek hours were unchanged at 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Work Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. Initial filings are nearing the lows of 2024. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired relative to early 2024. Initial Jobless Claim The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. Before the decline from the August 2024 unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Last month, the rate was within a whisker of triggering the Sahm Rule again, but the December unemployment decline moved it away from danger. U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: The Inauguration of Trump’s Oligarchy

Time Published: 2025-01-12T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
In modern terms, a Presidential Inauguration is an open-air branding opportunity. John F. Kennedy, a hatless Cold Warrior, placed his Administration at the vanguard of a new generation “born in this century,” and delivered an internationalist vow to “pay any price, bear any burden.” On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump set a distinctly different inaugural tone, delivering a sunless stem-winder of populist fury in which he vowed to heal the hellscape of “American carnage.” No longer would the country bow to self-serving élites and rapacious foreigners: “America will start winning again, winning like never before.” Upon leaving the reviewing stand, George W. Bush was heard to say, “That was some weird shit.” Trump was apoplectic about the coverage of his first hours in office, and he dispatched his spokesman, Sean Spicer, to the White House briefing room to declare that the press had “intentionally framed” images of the crowd to make it seem paltry, when, in fact, Trump had drawn, Spicer huffed incredibly, the “largest audience ever to witness an Inauguration, period.” Spicer then shifted registers to one of unmistakable threat. “And I’m here to tell you that it goes two ways,” he said. “We’re gonna hold the press accountable.” With that, the Era of Trump was truly inaugurated. Joe Biden, whose Presidency is now grinding to its conclusion, had hoped to render Trump’s Administration a historical fluke—a fleeting, if ugly, interregnum. And, as Biden leaves office, he can reasonably argue that jobs are up, inflation is down; violent crime has declined; and, for the first time in a generation, there are no American soldiers engaged in foreign battle. Nevertheless, Biden’s obdurate unwillingness to step aside for younger, more plausible Democratic candidates resulted in the reëmergence of his nemesis. Once more, the music of apocalypse is in the air: “Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!” Trump declared recently. He will return to the Oval Office with a résumé enhanced by two impeachments, one judgment of liability for sexual abuse, and a plump cluster of felony convictions. He will take the oath of office next week at the scene of his gravest transgression, his incitement of an insurrection on Capitol Hill. Still, Trump soldiers on, as if all the legal accusations against him are badges of merit, further proof of his anti-establishment street cred. Since the election, he has proposed so many advisers of low character and dubious qualification that he has overwhelmed the circuitry of the confirmation process and the public sphere. It’s almost as if the early proposition of Matt Gaetz to head the Justice Department were a way to divert attention from the unalloyed awfulness of so many others: Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Mehmet Oz, and Kristi Noem among them. The dessert for this feast of misbegotten nominations was served when Trump appointed Kimberly Guilfoyle, the longtime fiancée of his eldest son, Don, Jr., as the new Ambassador to Greece—a move that accommodates the son’s fresher affections for a Palm Beach socialite. Across the land, a willing suspension of disbelief has taken hold. (Critical thinking is so 2017.) Certain titans of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and (God forgive us) the media have hustled off to Mar-a-Lago, a scene of such flagrant self-abnegation, ring-kissing, and genuflection that it would embarrass a medieval Pope. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, no longer seems determined to fight the darkness; instead, he kills an endorsement drafted by his editors, watches as some of his most skilled reporters head for the exits, and pays forty million dollars for a documentary on Melania Trump. Mark Zuckerberg’s maga conversion is now so thorough that he has added Trump’s friend Dana White, the C.E.O. of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to the board of Meta. One of Trump’s most effective political maneuvers might be called “whacking the beehive,” a propensity to unleash so much buzzing menace into the air that it’s impossible to maintain calm, much less focus. Will he set up detention camps for undocumented immigrants? Will he split with nato and cut off Ukraine? Are we about to send the 82nd Airborne to descend on the good people of Nuuk? For decades, Vladimir Putin’s greatest rhetorical gambit has been the charge of hypocrisy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, American critics have rightly described Russia as an oligarchic state. In the nineteen-nineties, a half-dozen or so hustlers emerged from the rubble of the old system to exploit their proximity to Boris Yeltsin and his family to snatch up invaluable state properties––oil fields, mines, television stations––at knockoff prices. Putin came along, in 2000, and eventually deposed most of the first-generation oligarchs, replacing them with his own satraps. He created a personalist system in which all power and all fortunes depended on his good graces. Perhaps what is most striking about the ascendant Trump Administration, which takes pains to cast itself as the champion of a forgotten working class, is its own oligarchic features. The influence of big money in American politics is hardly new. To read Theodore Dreiser’s “The Financier” is to plunge headlong into the muck of Gilded Age deceit. The essential modern text is Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that equates money with speech, resulting in an ever more corrupt system of campaign finance. Something ominous, if not entirely novel, is taking shape in Washington. When Trump takes the oath of office, on January 20th, Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, will not be far away. Like so many other tech billionaires, Musk apparently thinks of himself as a self-reliant genius-of-the-future, a Nietzschean superman, and yet he well knows that everything from the rise of the Internet to the creation of many newer technologies profits from the support of the state. What’s more, Musk’s influence, unlike that of his Gilded Age predecessors, is amplified by his gargantuan following on a social-media engine in his possession. When Trump steps up to the lectern next week to recite the oath of office, he will stand beside his wife. But he will have a great deal of other company—multibillionaires who have shamelessly dispensed with principle to seek an indulgent new President’s favor and enhance their fortunes. ♦

Title: Is AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (ASTS) Among the Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) stands against the other growth stocks. The latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025. Sanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made. Speaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are "thinking about yields." She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward. Sanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out. The market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:ASTS) ranks first on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. The satellite designer and manufacturer is based in Texas, United States, with plans to connect mobile phones to the cellular broadband satellite networks, allowing people to go online from anywhere they want. In 2024, the AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) launched and deployed its first five BlueBird satellites and also partnered with key companies like Google, Verizon, AT&T, and Vodafone. The company has secured these partnerships to ensure it provides 100% coverage in the United States. ASTS has also secured several awards for its revolutionary technologies and innovations over the past year, contributing to its popularity among investors. The company is truly transforming the way people connect with the world through its capabilities in cellular connectivity. ASTS intends to target current mobile network operators, subscribers, and individuals who are residing in areas with little to no network access, and become a leader in the industry. Overall ASTS ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ASTS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASTS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Axon’s Global Expansion Could Spark Its Next Big Rally

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Axon (AXON) stock was one of 2024’s major winners. Shares of the nonlethal weapons company posted a scorching 167% return for the year, and the stock joined the Nasdaq-100, an influential index of the 100 largest non-financial stocks listed on the tech-centric Nasdaq (NDX) exchange. But Axon has slumped out of the gate in 2025, and shares are now down 19.9% from their 52-week high. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Is it time to buy the dip on this once high-flying stock? Personally, I’m bullish on Axon due to its diversified and growing suite of products and offerings, its history as a long-term winner, and the tremendous global opportunities it still has ahead of it. Axon is best known for the TASER stun guns it provides to law enforcement officers, but there is much more to the company than just these nonlethal weapons. Axon also makes the body cameras worn by police officers and fleet cameras deployed in police vehicles. In addition, the company is home to a growing cloud software business, Axon Cloud, which is used to manage digital evidence, boost productivity, and support real-time operations. Axon has also forayed into drones and drone defense, acquiring Sky Hero, a maker of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) in 2023. It also purchased airspace security provider Dedrone in 2024. While it is still early innings for both of these businesses, the timing of these acquisitions could prove prescient as interest in drones among the general public (and awareness of the potential threats they can pose) has skyrocketed following a spate of mysterious drone sightings in the skies above New Jersey in December 2024. What I really like about Axon’s suite of products and services is that they are complementary and create a flywheel effect. For example, Axon can get its foot in the door with a local or state law enforcement agency through its TASER guns or body cameras. It can then cross-sell and upsell these customers on the benefits of storing the footage from these body cameras on Axon Cloud or using its Draft One AI tool to help write police reports. During the third quarter of 2024, the company reported stellar net revenue retention of 123%, indicating that customers are renewing their contracts with Axon and purchasing additional products, leading them to increase their spending from the prior year. Strong net revenue retention is often viewed as the sign of a great software stock, and Axon is exhibiting it. Axon is also attractive because as more customers begin using its cloud, its revenue will become increasingly subscription-based over time. Subscription revenue is attractive, given its recurring, predictable nature. In 2019, 73% of Axon’s revenue was subscription-based, and by 2023, this percentage increased to 95%. Axon’s 167% gain in 2024 was certainly impressive, but strong returns are nothing new for this long-term winner. In fact, over the past 10 years, Axon has generated an incredible total return of 2,063%. Indeed, shares traded for $25.23 a decade ago and are worth $565.85 today, representing a monumental return for long-term Axon shareholders. The company is now much bigger than it was back then, so with a market cap of $43.8 billion, it may be difficult to generate these same levels of returns going forward, but Axon is clearly a long-term winner that has outperformed the market over the past 10 years, which gives me confidence that it will eventually bounce back from the current correction and return to winning ways. While Axon has racked up incredible long-term gains, the company is, in many ways, just scratching the surface of its long-term potential. For example, while TASER has reached 35% market penetration in the U.S., it only enjoys 3% penetration in Europe, 1% in Latin America, and 0% in Asia, with each of these markets representing a massive opportunity for Axon going forward. Similarly, body cameras have reached 14% penetration in the U.S., versus just 1% in Europe, 1% in Latin America, and 2% in Asia. But perhaps the biggest area of growth potential is Axon Cloud. The company says Axon Cloud has reached 4% penetration in the U.S., meaning there is ample runway ahead in its home market. In addition, there are plenty of international opportunities as the software suite has 0% penetration in Europe, Latin America, or Asia. It is worth noting that the company generated $1.94 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, but it believes that between these various products and geographic markets, its total addressable market is currently $77 billion, meaning that there is plenty of green space ahead. In many ways, Axon is well-positioned to handle any economic environment. Axon’s sales are not driven by consumer demand, so in the event of an economic downturn, demand for its products should be fairly resilient. Axon primarily sells its products to law enforcement agencies and points out that even when GDP dips, spending on public safety remains stable or increases, as it did during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Plus, Axon may find itself well-suited to the current political environment with Donald Trump set to become President on January 20. Rising crime and a return to law and order were major themes of Trump’s platform, and Trump has frequently sought to position himself as a staunch supporter of law enforcement. Therefore, it’s hard to imagine that a Trump presidency will be bad for a company like Axon that serves this community. Axon is a great company, so the primary risk for Axon investors today is that after 2024’s run, shares are richly valued, even when accounting for the recent pullback. Shares trade at 89.8 times consensus 2025 earnings estimates and 16.8 times 2025 sales estimates. This type of valuation is likely unsustainable over time, and these high expectations put the stock at risk of a further pullback if it disappoints the market with future results. That said, the company is firing on all cylinders and growing at a rapid rate — during the most recent quarter, it grew revenue by 32% year-over-year, continuing a trend of long-term growth. If it keeps executing on its expansion plans, it should be able to outpace analyst estimates and grow into this valuation over time. Turning to Wall Street, AXON earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average analyst AXON stock price target of $622.92 per share implies 9.3% upside potential from current levels. See more AXON analyst ratings Overall, I’m bullish on Axon based on its compelling suite of complementary products and services, and the significant growth opportunities it still has ahead of it. The stock has been a major winner over the past decade, but there is plenty of potential upside ahead. This is the type of business I want exposure to over the long term, and I view the temporary weakness in shares as an attractive opportunity for investors who have been waiting to get on board this long-term winner.

Title: Is Mastercard (MA) the Best Financial Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. According to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. The year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry. As of January 7, 2025, the market’s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector’s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%. Looking forward, according to Fidelity’s report, the financial industry’s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve’s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins. As per Fidelity analyst Matt Reed: “Lower rates boost economic momentum, benefiting banks and payment processors alike.” Banks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide. Risks still exist, though. As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler stated: “I think investors have rotated a little bit out of some of the big tech companies and into the big financial companies,” He claimed that while a lot of optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is priced into tech businesses, some investor movement made sense since the rate environment has improved for bank earnings. Deloitte’s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates.

UPDATED 13:14 EST / JANUARY 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and David Floyer We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing, or EPC — or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. Though artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia Corp. sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10- to 20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore how extreme parallel computing is reshaping the tech landscape, the performance of the major semiconductor players, the competition Nvidia faces, the depth of its moat, and how its software stack cements its leadership. We will also address a recent development from CES — the arrival of so-called “AI PCs” — with data from Enterprise Technology Research. We’ll then look at how the data center market could reach $1.7 trillion by 2035. Finally, we will discuss both the upside potential and the risks that threaten this positive scenario. Our research indicates that every layer of the technology stack — from compute to storage to networking to the software layers — will be re-architected for AI-driven workloads and extreme parallelism. We believe the transition from general-purpose, x86, central processing units toward distributed clusters of graphics processing units and specialized accelerators is happening even faster than many anticipated. What follows is our brief assessment of several layers of the data center tech stack and the implications of EPC. For more than three decades, x86 architectures dominated computing. Today, general-purpose processing is giving way to specialized accelerators. GPUs are the heart of this change. AI workloads such as large language models, natural language processing, advanced analytics and real-time inference demand massive concurrency. While storage is sometimes overlooked in AI conversations, data is the fuel that drives neural networks. We believe AI demands advanced, high-performance storage solutions: With mobile and cloud last decade we saw a shift in network traffic from a north-south trajectory (user-to-data center) toward an east-west bias (server-to-server). AI-driven workloads cause massive east-west and north-south traffic within the data center and across networks. In the world of HPC, InfiniBand emerged as the go-to for ultra-low-latency interconnects. Now, we see that trend permeate hyperscale data centers, with high-performance Ethernet as a dominant standard which will ultimately in our view prove to be the prevailing open network of choice: OS and system-level software Accelerated computing imposes huge demands on operating systems, middleware, libraries, compilers and application frameworks. These must be tuned to exploit GPU resources. As developers create more advanced applications — some bridging real-time analytics and historical data — system-level software must manage concurrency at unprecedented levels. The OS, middleware, tools, libraries and compilers are rapidly evolving to support ultra-parallel workloads with the ability to exploit GPUs (that is, GPU-aware OSes). Data layer Data is the fuel for AI and the data stack is rapidly becoming infused with intelligence. We see the data layer shifting from an historical system of analytics to a real-time engine that supports the creation of real time digital representations of an organization, comprising people, places and things as well as processes. To support this vision, data harmonization via knowledge graphs, unified metadata repositories, agent control frameworks, unified governance and connectors to operational and analytic systems will emerge. The application layer Intelligent applications are emerging that unify and harmonize data. These apps increasingly have real time access to business logic as well as process knowledge. Single-agent systems are evolving to multi-agent architectures with the ability to learn from the reasoning traces of humans. Applications increasingly can understand human language, are injecting intelligence (in other words, AI everywhere) and supporting automation of workflows and new ways of creating business outcomes. Applications increasingly are becoming extensions to the physical world with opportunities in virtually all industries to create digital twins that represent a business in real time. Key takeaway: Extreme parallel computing represents a wholesale rethinking of the technology stack — compute, storage, networking and especially the operating system layer. It places GPUs and other accelerators at the center of the architectural design. The above graphic shows the five-year stock performance of major semiconductor players, with the “AI zone” shaded starting in late 2022 — roughly coinciding with the initial buzz around ChatGPT. Until that timeframe, many were skeptical that large-scale GPU-accelerated AI would become such a powerful business driver. In our view, the market has recognized that semiconductors are the foundation of future AI capabilities, awarding premium multiples to companies that can capture accelerated compute demand. This year, the “haves” (led by Nvidia, Broadcom and AMD) are outperforming, while the “have-nots” (in particular, Intel) are lagging. Nvidia’s 65% operating margins have enticed investors and competitors to enter the AI chip market in droves. Both incumbents and new entrants have responded aggressively. Yet the market potential is so large and Nvidia’s lead is so substantial that in our view, near-term competition will not hurt Nvidia. Nonetheless, we see multiple angles regarding Nvidia’s challengers, each with its own market approach. We align these two leaders because: 1) Broadcom powers custom chips such as Google’s tensor processing units or TPUs; and 2) We believe that TPU v4 is extremely competitive in AI. Broadcom’s IP around SerDes, optics and networking is best-in-class and together with Google represents in our view the most viable technical alternative relative to Nvidia. Importantly, Broadcom also has had a long-term relationship with Meta and powers its AI chips. Both Google and Meta have proved that AI return on investment in consumer advertising pays off. While many enterprises struggle with AI ROI, these two firms are demonstrating impressive return on invested capital from AI. Both Google and Meta are leaning into Ethernet as a networking standard. Broadcom is a strong supporter of Ethernet and a leading voice in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Moreover, Broadcom is the only company other than Nvidia with proven expertise on networking within and across XPUs and across XPU clusters, making the company an extremely formidable competitor in AI silicon. AMD’s data center strategy hinges on delivering competitive AI accelerators — building on the company’s track record in x86. Though it has a serious GPU presence for gaming and HPC, the AI software ecosystem (centered on CUDA) remains a key obstacle. AMD has made aggressive moves in AI. It is aligning with Intel to try to keep x86 viability alive. It has acquired ZT Systems to better understand end-to-end AI systems requirements and will be a viable alternative of merchant silicon, especially for inference workloads. Ultimately we believe AMD will capture a relatively small share (single digits) of a massive market. It will manage x86 market declines by gaining share against Intel and make inroads into cost sensitive AI chip markets against Nvidia. Once the undisputed leader in processors, Intel’s fortunes have turned amid the shift toward accelerated compute. We continue to see Intel hampered by the massive capital requirements of retaining its own foundry. Amazon’s custom silicon approach has succeeded with Graviton in CPU instances. Its acquisition of Annapurna Labs is one of the best investments in the history of enterprise tech. And certainly it’s one that is often overlooked. Today, AWS works with Marvell and is applying a Graviton-like strategy to GPUs with Trainium (for training) and Inferentia (for inference). Dylan Patel’s take on Amazon’s GPU sums it up in our view. Here’s what he said on a recent episode of the BG2 pod: Amazon, their whole thing at re:Invent, if you really talk to them when they announce Trainium 2 and our whole post about it and our analysis of it is supply chain-wise… you squint your eyes, This looks like a Amazon Basics TPU, right? It’s decent, right? But it’s really cheap, A; and B, it gives you the most HBM capacity per dollar and most HBM memory bandwidth per dollar of any chip on the market. And therefore it actually makes sense for certain applications to use. And so this is like a real shift. Like, hey, we maybe can’t design as well as Nvidia, but we can put more memory on the package. [Dylan Patel’s take on Amazon Trainium] Our view is that AWS’ offering will be cost-optimized — and offer an alternative GPU approach within the AWS ecosystem for both training an inference. Though developers ultimately may prefer the familiarity and performance of Nvidia’s platform, AWS will offer as many viable choices to customers as it can and will get a fair share of its captive market. Probably not the penetration it sees with Graviton relative to merchant x86 silicon but a decent amount of adoption to justify the investment. We don’t have a current forecast for Trainium at this time, but it’s something we’re watching to get better data. Microsoft has historically lagged AWS and Google in custom silicon, though it does have ongoing projects, such as Maia. Microsoft can offset any silicon gap with its software dominance and willingness to pay Nvidia’s margins for high-end GPUs. Qualcomm is a key supplier for Microsoft client devices. Qualcomm, as indicated, competes in mobile and edge, but as robotics and distributed AI applications expand, we see potential for more direct clashes with Nvidia. Firms such as Cerebras Systems Inc., SambaNova Systems Inc., Tenstorrent Inc. and Graphcore Ltd. have introduced specialized AI architectures. China is also developing homegrown GPU or GPU-like accelerators. However, the unifying challenge remains software compatibility, developer momentum and the steep climb to dislodge a de facto standard. Key takeaway: Though competition is strong, none of these players alone threatens Nvidia’s long-term dominance — unless Nvidia makes significant missteps. The market’s size is vast enough that multiple winners can thrive. We see Nvidia’s competitive advantage as a multifaceted moat spanning hardware and software. It has taken nearly two decades of systematic innovation to produce an integrated ecosystem that is both broad and deep. Nvidia’s GPUs employ advanced process nodes, including HBM memory integration and specialized tensor cores that deliver huge leaps in AI performance. Notably, Nvidia can push a new GPU iteration every 12 to 18 months. Meanwhile, it uses “whole cow” methods — ensuring that every salvageable die has a place in its portfolio (data center, PC GPUs or automotive). This keeps yields high and margins healthy. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. put Nvidia in control of InfiniBand, enabling it to sell comprehensive end-to-end systems for AI clusters and get to market quickly. The integration of ConnectX and BlueField DPUs extends Nvidia’s leadership in ultra-fast networking, a critical component for multi-GPU scaling. As the industry moves toward the Ultra Ethernet standard, many see this as a threat to Nvidia’s moat. We do not. Though networking is a critical component of Nvidia’s time to market advantage, we see it as a supporting member of its portfolio. In our view, the company can and will successfully optimize its stack for Ethernet as the market demands; and it will maintain its core advantage, which comes from tight integration across its stack. Nvidia’s software ecosystem has grown far beyond CUDA to include frameworks for nearly every stage of AI application development. The net result is that developers have more reason to stay within Nvidia’s ecosystem rather than seeking alternatives. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, has frequently underscored the company’s emphasis on building a partner network. Virtually every major tech supplier and cloud provider offers Nvidia-based instances or solutions. That broad footprint generates significant network effects, reinforcing the moat. Key takeaway: Nvidia’s advantage does not hinge on chips alone. Its integration of hardware and software — underpinned by a vast ecosystem — forms a fortress-like moat that is difficult to replicate. CUDA rightly dominates the software discussion, but Nvidia’s stack is broad. Below we highlight six important layers: CUDA, NVMI/NVSM (here denoted as “NIMS”), Nemo, Omniverse, Cosmos and Nvidia’s developer libraries/toolkits. Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is Nvidia’s foundational parallel computing platform. It abstracts away the complexities of GPU hardware and allows developers to write applications in languages like C/C++, Fortran, Python, and others. CUDA orchestrates GPU cores and optimizes workload scheduling for accelerated AI, HPC, graphics, and more. Nvidia NIMS are a set of inference microservices designed to simplify and accelerate the deployment of foundation models on any cloud or data center. NeMo is an end-to-end framework for developing and fine-tuning large language models and natural language applications. It provides pre-built modules, pretrained models, and the tooling to export those models into other Nvidia products, helping speed time-to-insight for businesses that want to leverage NLP and large language models. Omniverse is a platform for 3D design collaboration, simulation, and real-time visualization. While originally showcased for design engineering and media, Omniverse now extends into robotics, digital twins and advanced physics-based simulations. It leverages CUDA for graphical rendering, combining real-time graphics with AI-driven simulation capabilities. Cosmos is a platform that helps developers create world models for physical AI systems. It’s used to accelerate the development of robotics and autonomous vehicles. Beyond the core frameworks, Nvidia has developed hundreds of specialized libraries for neural network operations, linear algebra, device drivers, HPC applications, image processing and more. These libraries are meticulously tuned for GPU acceleration — further locking in the developer community that invests time to master them. Key takeaway: The software stack is arguably the most important factor in Nvidia’s sustained leadership. CUDA is only part of the story. The depth and maturity of Nvidia’s broader AI software suite forms a formidable barrier to entry for new challengers. Although this Breaking Analysis focuses on data center transformation, we would be remiss not to discuss AI PCs briefly. At CES this year, multiple vendors announced laptops and desktops branded as “AI PCs,” often featuring NPUs (neural processing units) or specialized GPUs for on-device inference. Survey data shown above is from ETR in a survey of approximately 1,835 information technology decision makers. The vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum and the horizontal axis is Overlap or penetration within those 1,835 accounts. The table insert shows how the dots are plotted (Net Score and N). It shows Dell laptops at the top of the share curve with 543 N, with strong spending momentum across Apple, HP, and Lenovo. The plot reveals healthy spending momentum for leading PC suppliers. Currently, the NPU often sits idle in many AI PCs because software stacks are still not fully optimized. Over time, we expect more specialized AI applications on client devices — potentially enabling real-time language translation, image/video processing, advanced security and local LLM inference at smaller scales. We believe Nvidia, with its track record in GPUs, can offer AI PC technology that is more performant than typical NPUs on mobile or notebooks. However, the power consumption, thermals, and cost constraints remain significant challenges. We do see Nvidia using salvaged “whole cow” dies and building them into laptop GPUs with reduced power envelopes. Although this section deviates from the data center focus, AI PCs could drive developer adoption. On-device AI makes sense for productivity, specialized workloads, and specific vertical use cases. This, in turn, may reinforce the broader ecosystem transition to parallel computing architectures. We have modeled the entire data center market — servers, storage, networking, power, cooling and related infrastructure — from 2019 through 2035. Our research points to a rapid transition away from traditional general-purpose computing toward extreme parallel computing. We categorize “extreme parallel computing” as the specialized hardware and software for AI training, inference, HPC clusters and advanced analytics. Currently, we estimate that Nvidia accounts for roughly 25% of the entire data center segment. Our view is that Nvidia will retain that leading share throughout the forecast period — assuming it avoids unforced errors — despite intense competition from hyperscalers, AMD and others. Key takeaway: The anticipated shift toward accelerated compute forms the foundation of our bullish stance on data center growth. We believe extreme parallel computing ushers in a multi-year (or even multi-decade) supercycle for data center infrastructure investments. We assert that a new trillion-dollar-plus marketplace is emerging, fueled by AI. The data center — as we have known it — will transform into a distributed, parallel processing fabric where GPUs and specialized accelerators become the norm. Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform (hardware + software + ecosystem) leads this transition, but it is not alone. Hyperscalers, competing semiconductor firms, and specialized startups all have roles to play in a rapidly expanding market. Despite our positive assessment, we acknowledge several risks: Final word: Nvidia’s future looks bright, in our view, but it cannot be complacent. The company’s best defense remains relentless innovation in both hardware and software — a strategy that has carried it to where it is today and will likely drive its continued leadership in this new era of extreme parallel computing.

By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Amazon will be winding down its Prime Try Before You Buy program, which let Prime members try on clothes before paying for them, reports The Information. It will shutter on January 31st, according to a banner at the top of the service’s landing page. Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay said in a statement emailed to The Verge that the company is discontinuing the service because it only worked for a “limited number of items” and customers have been “increasingly using our new AI-powered features” to decide what to buy. Tagay gave examples like Virtual Try-On AR feature that puts 3D renders of shoes from certain brands on your feet using your smartphone’s camera. She also mentioned the company’s LLM-powered “personalized size recommendations” that tweak size recommendations based on customer reviews. Prime Try Before You Buy launched in 2018 for all Prime subscribers as Amazon Wardrobe before the company later changed its name. Through it, Prime members can order up to six items, try them for seven days, then pay for what works and send back the rest — like a very basic version of Stitch Fix’s curated clothing service. But a big part of that is returns, which is something the company has been trying to cut back on. The discontinuation of Prime Try Before You Buy comes after years of cost-cutting at the company, as CNBC points out. That’s included massive layoffs and shuttering physical stores, as well as scaling back some of its efforts in the grocery industry. Here is the full statement Tagay provided to The Verge: Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option, effective January 31, 2025. Of course, customers will continue to enjoy fast, free shipping, with easy, free returns on our full apparel selection. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

Title: Nvidia's AI empire: A look at its top startup investments | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT a little over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared more than eightfold. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Of course, Nvidia is not the only large tech corporation writing checks to AI startups. But over the last two years, it was the most active. Compared to Nvidia’s 83 deals in two years (2023 and 2024), Alphabet participated in 73, while Microsoft has done 40 rounds, PitchBook data shows. Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million over the past two years where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup a year prior. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company reportedly has its sights on a $35 billion IPO this year. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: Previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D.

Title: Treasury Intensifies Sanctions Against Russia by Targeting Russia's Oil Production and Exports

U.S. Department of the Treasury January 10, 2025 New energy sector determination targets Russia's primary revenue source with sanctions against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, more than 180 vessels, and dozens of oil traders, oilfield service providers, insurance companies, and energy officials WASHINGTON -- Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury took sweeping action to fulfill the G7 commitment to reduce Russian revenues from energy, including blocking two major Russian oil producers. Today's actions also impose sanctions on an unprecedented number of oil-carrying vessels, many of which are part of the "shadow fleet," opaque traders of Russian oil, Russia-based oilfield service providers, and Russian energy officials. Today's actions are underpinned by the issuance of a new determination that authorizes sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 against persons operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. These actions substantially increase the sanctions risks associated with the Russian oil trade. The United Kingdom (UK) is also taking action today, joining Treasury in sanctioning two major Russian oil producers. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia's key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine," said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. "This action builds on, and strengthens, our focus since the beginning of the war on disrupting the Kremlin's energy revenues, including through the G7+ price cap launched in 2022. With today's actions, we are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports." The Department of State is also taking steps to reduce Russia's energy revenues by blocking two active liquefied natural gas projects, a large Russian oil project, and third-country entities supporting Russia's energy exports. State is also designating numerous Russia-based oilfield service providers and senior officials of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom. Today, the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State are taking action to further implement commitments made by G7 leaders to reduce Russian revenues from energy and other commodities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, issued a determination pursuant to E.O. 14024 that authorizes the imposition of sanctions on any person determined to operate or have operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. This new determination strengthens the ability of Treasury and State to target revenueâin particular, revenue generated from the export of oilâthat Russia uses to fuel its brutal war against Ukraine and other harmful foreign activities. Additionally, Treasury issued amended General License 8L, which authorizes certain wind-down transactions related to energy through 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 12, 2025. The narrowing authorization for transactions related to Russian energy further reduces Russia's ability to leverage this sector and fund its war machine. Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, issued a new determination pursuant to E.O. 14071 prohibiting the provision of U.S. petroleum services to persons located in the Russian Federation, cutting off Russia's access to U.S. services related to the extraction and production of crude oil and other petroleum products. The prohibition takes effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 27, 2025. Pursuant to today's determination, OFAC designated two of Russia's most significant oil producers and exporters pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy and pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft (Gazprom Neft) is a Russia-based, vertically integrated oil company whose core activities include the exploration, production, and sale of oil. Surgutneftegas is a Russia-based, vertically integrated oil company whose core activities include the exploration, production, and sale of oil. The UK is also sanctioning Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas today. Alongside Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, OFAC is designating more than two dozen Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas subsidiaries. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, or their subsidiaries listed today, are also subject to blocking, even if not identified by OFAC. For more information on the Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas subsidiaries targeted today, please see Annex 1. Russia has grown increasingly reliant on vessels that participate in high-risk shipping practices to facilitate illicit or sanctionable activity, often called the "shadow fleet." Today's action sanctions 183 vessels, largely oil tankers that are part of the shadow fleet as well as oil tankers owned by Russia-based fleet operators. Several of the vessels sanctioned today have shipped not only Russian oil, but also sanctioned Iranian oil. OFAC is also sanctioning two Russia-based maritime insurance providers, Ingosstrakh Insurance Company and Alfastrakhovanie Group, which were previously sanctioned by the UK. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 2. Similarly, Russia's dependence on opaque traders willing to ship and sell its oil has dramatically increased. These traders often are registered in high-risk jurisdictions, have murky corporate structures and personnel with links to Russia, and conceal their business activities. Many were only established in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and quickly began moving hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Russian oil within months of their creation. OFAC has previously sanctioned such traders and is taking further action today by sanctioning opaque traders and a shadowy Government of Russia-linked network facilitating massive amounts of oil exports. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 3. Russia's domestic oil industry is supported by providers with critical specialized services that enable producers to keep oil flowing from wells and provide technical know-how and equipment to allow oil producers to access challenging reserves. In addition to the determination described above that prohibits the provision of U.S. petroleum services to persons located in the Russian Federation, today's action sanctions more than 30 Russia-based oilfield service providers. Additionally, OFAC is sanctioning more than a dozen leading Russian energy officials and executives, including the CEOs of a number of Russian oil producers. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 4.

Several billionaire money managers have modified their portfolios and poured about $1.8 billion into new assets, according to a new report. Billionaires Philippe Laffont, Stanley Druckenmiller, Chase Coleman, Stephen Mandel and Larry Robbins are accumulating AI-centered equities, reports The Motley Fool. The investors have specifically targeted US semiconductor and software giant Broadcom (AVGO), purchasing a total of 1,728,646 shares valued at about $1.47 billion in the third quarter of last year. The firm’s AI revenue has surged in recent months, powering a 125% rise in the stock over the last year. The wealthy investors have also purchased roughly 1,749,613 shares of Amazon, worth about $245 million, as the company’s cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) implements generative AI solutions for customers. Lastly, the billionaires have bought 621,445 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), worth about $62 million, betting on the world’s largest chip manufacturer. The billionaires’ new plays in artificial intelligence come as analysts at PwC forecast the total addressable market for AI will hit $15.7 trillion by 2030, as the groundbreaking technology transforms business and manufacturing worldwide.
