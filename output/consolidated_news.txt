Ohio State Sen. Jerry Cirino weighs in on Democratic opposition on the Buckeye State banning DEI practices at public colleges. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office and signed a number of executive orders to quickly undo former President Joe Biden’s efforts. The president, just hours after taking the Oath of Office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, signed an executive order to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government. He also quickly signed an order making it "the official policy of the U.S. government to only recognize two genders: male and female." WHITE HOUSE OPM ORDERS ALL DEI OFFICES TO BEGIN CLOSING BY END OF DAY WEDNESDAY A day later, the president directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to notify heads of agencies and departments to close all DEI offices and place those government workers in those offices on paid leave.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) That move quickly forced those offices to take down all outward facing media — websites, social media accounts, and more — for those DEI offices, and required the withdrawal of any final pending documents, directives, orders, materials and equity plans. Trump also canceled current and impending contracts focused on DEI initiatives, with Elon Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that move saved the federal government $420 million. The president also issued two other executive actions that day targeting DEI. One was an executive order to end discrimination in the workplace and higher education through race and sex-based preferences under the guise of DEI. The other was a memo to eliminate a Biden administration policy that prioritized DEI hiring at the Federal Aviation Administration. In the memo rolling back Biden's DEI hiring practices at the FAA, Trump ordered the secretary of transportation and FAA administrator to immediately stop Biden's DEI hiring programs and return to nondiscriminatory, merit-based hiring. TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS Trump also required that the FAA administrator review the past performance and performance standards of all agency employees in critical safety positions and make it clear that anyone who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure flight safety and efficiency.

David Ake/Getty Images) "Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence," the memo read. The memo stated: "All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication." Trump also rescinded Biden’s order on diversity initiatives, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government," which he signed on his first day in office in 2021. In February, the Department of Education also warned state education departments that they must remove DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. That move came after Trump signed executive orders directing agencies to provide a plan to eliminate federal funding for "illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. A new study revealed that nearly half of U.S. college students don't DEI courses mandated in their schools. (Fox News) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs. Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency’s "Scientific Integrity Policy" implemented during the last few weeks of Biden’s term, to peel back any DEI requirements. That Biden-era policy said that DEI was an "integral" part of "the entire scientific process," and pushed NIH's chief scientist and top scientific integrity official to "promote agency efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion." It also instituted agency-wide policy directives ordering supervisors at the NIH to "support" scientists and researchers who are "asexual" or "intersex," while imploring NIH leadership to "confer with relevant offices" when additional DEI expertise is needed. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI "The Biden administration weaponized NIH’s scientific integrity policy to inject harmful DEI and gender ideology into research," said Health and Human Services Department spokesperson, Andrew Nixon. "Rescinding this (scientific integrity) policy will allow NIH to restore science to its golden standard and protect the integrity of science." The Biden administration also funded grants related to DEI, such as one for roughly $165,000 that was focused on "queering the curriculum" for family medicine doctors to guide them in their treatment of transgender patients. Those grants have been canceled. And earlier this week, multiple federal agencies told Fox News Digital that they have dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services over the business social network’s embrace of DEI. The Departments of Treasury, Interior and Veterans Affairs dropped LinkedIn — a move to comply with the president’s executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies.

"Under the leadership of President Trump, we have been combing through hundreds of thousands of contracts here at the Department alone and are canceling wasteful, woke, and downright ridiculous contracts that do not align with the will of the American people." LinkedIn DEI services (LinkedIn) A LinkedIn spokesperson told Fox News Digital, in response, that: "Like every business, the organizations that use our products change, often driven by shifts in their budgets and priorities. We’re keeping our focus on helping our customers achieve the objectives they’ve set." Fox News Digital's David Spector and Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.

Even before those 50,000 layoffs in 2025, Silicon Valley's Mercury News was citing some interesting statistics from economic research/consulting firm Beacon Economics. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the San Francisco Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs But then in 2023 and 2024 the industry had slashed even more tech jobs -- 80,200 -- for a net loss (over five years) of 5,500. So is there really a cutback in perks and a fear of layoffs that's casting a pall over the industry? share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. Do you agree with the picture that's being painted by the Wall Street Journal? They told their readers that tech workers are now "just like the rest of us: miserable at work."

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Not so long ago, the idea of public tech companies emerging from Latin America seemed far-fetched, and Mercado Libre once appeared as rare and mythical as a true unicorn. Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notably going public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin America demonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that became a super app and expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raised a $1 billion investment from SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to the round of more than $500 million it secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds of layoffs and facing changing gig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans to invest $110 million to boost its operations. However, the company still very much hopes to IPO and hired a CFO to prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities in six Latin American countries and a tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcing a $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 million at a $5.1 billion valuation. With $755 million raised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lender at $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It was extended in July 2022 at the same valuation, allowing Creditas to buy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbank for some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short, “Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the $500 million Series E mega-round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after its Accel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded by Victor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’ $60 million Series A in 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached a nearly $3 billion valuation from its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstage at Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill would replace Lazarte as CEO. It also conducted several rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech company supported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the company at $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conducted two rounds of layoffs in 2022 but denied having raised a down round in November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from a sovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed to have reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raised in April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at $2.28 billion in December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. After increasing its stake in 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had its first-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valued at $8.7 billion after a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuation slashed by $6.5 billion following expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek and QED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with the Chinese facial-recognition software company by the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitability in 2023 and closed 2024 with $497 million in revenue. Briefly known as BlitzPay and founded by former PayPal employees, Clip is the Square of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a $250 million round led by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raised in June 2024 confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEO told Bloomberg. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for its focus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round was a $205 million Series F led by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Bets are still open on who may join the list and how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated. Topics Freelance Reporter Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.

Title: SPAS-12 History Value: Legacy and Rising Price

Time Published: 2025-04-27T14:00:00Z

The SPAS-12 shotgun, with its rich history and significant value, stands as one of the most iconic firearms of its time. Known for its unique design and powerful performance, the SPAS-12’s history and value have only grown over the years, making it a prized collectible for enthusiasts. Check out our video reel showcasing the SPAS-12 in action on Facebook and Instagram: The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) was a combat shotgun manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Initially designed as a law enforcement and military shotgun, the SPAS-12 became iconic due to its unique dual-mode action, allowing it to function as both a semi-automatic and pump-action shotgun. Its distinctive appearance, combined with a folding metal stock, heat shield, and overall aggressive design, contributed to its cult status among firearm enthusiasts, collectors, and Hollywood filmmakers alike. The SPAS-12 was unique in that it was one of the few shotguns designed with a dual-action mode, allowing the user to switch between semi-automatic and pump-action operation. The ability to cycle between these modes gave it a tactical advantage in specific scenarios. In semi-automatic mode, it could rapidly fire shells, while in pump-action mode, it could handle a broader range of ammunition, including lower-powered shells that might not cycle in a gas-operated system. Some other notable features include: Due to its versatility and intimidating appearance, the SPAS-12 was marketed toward military, law enforcement, and civilian buyers, although it was ultimately restricted in many regions due to firearm regulations. In 1994, the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was enacted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Public Law No. 103-322). This legislation restricted the sale and importation of certain firearms based on a set of cosmetic and functional features, rather than their actual operational capabilities. The SPAS-12, with its tactical appearance, pistol grip, and semi-automatic functionality, was classified as an “excessively lethal firearm” by proponents of the ban. Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004). This flawed logic exposed the major weaknesses of the ban. The legislation focused heavily on appearances rather than functionality, meaning firearms that operated identically to banned guns but looked different remained legal. The SPAS-12, for example, was essentially just a heavier, bulkier version of many legally available shotguns. The law failed to target criminal misuse of firearms, instead restricting law-abiding citizens from purchasing certain guns simply because they looked “scary.” Further demonstrating its ineffectiveness, a 2004 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that the Assault Weapons Ban had no measurable impact on gun violence during its ten-year enforcement (Koper, 2004). Even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a meta-analysis and found “insufficient evidence” that banning certain firearms reduced crime rates (Hahn et al., 2005). The sunset clause in the AWB ensured that the law would expire on September 13, 2004, unless renewed by Congress, which did not occur (Kleck, 2001). However, due to the ban’s restrictions on importation, shipments of the SPAS-12 to the United States ended in 1994, with Franchi ultimately ceasing production of the model in 2000. Ironically, instead of reducing access to “dangerous weapons,” the ban fueled demand for firearms like the SPAS-12, driving up prices and making them more desirable to collectors. Today, the SPAS-12 remains a sought-after collectible, proving that cosmetic bans do little more than inconvenience lawful gun owners while failing to address actual crime. The SPAS-12 gained legendary status not only among firearm collectors but also in Hollywood and video games. It was famously wielded by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 in The Terminator (1984), reinforcing its image as a formidable weapon. Additionally, Robert Muldoon, the game warden in Jurassic Park (1993), carried a SPAS-12 while facing off against velociraptors. The gun also became a staple in the gaming world, appearing in franchises such as: This widespread representation cemented the SPAS-12’s place in pop culture, making it one of the most recognizable shotguns ever produced. Many firearm enthusiasts consider the SPAS-12 to be a “grail gun”, meaning it is a highly desirable and rare firearm in the collecting community. The limited availability and cultural significance of the SPAS-12 have led to a massive increase in its market value. When the shotgun was still in production, its retail price in the United States was approximately $1,500 in its final year of availability. By 2016, auction prices for the SPAS-12 had climbed to an average of $2,588 (Rock Island Auction, 2016). The value increase continued at an unprecedented rate, and by 2022, the price of an SPAS-12 at auction had skyrocketed to an average of $7,000. As of 2025, the SPAS-12 remains one of the hottest collectibles in the firearms market, with some pristine examples exceeding $10,000 at auction. This dramatic price surge outpaces many other classic firearms and highlights the enduring demand for rare and historically significant tactical shotguns (Miller, 2023).

Additionally, they offer custom heirloom-grade display cases and handcrafted leather goods built to last. The Benelli M2 also has the option to switch between semi-auto and pump, though the semi action is inertia blowback instead of gas-operated. That makes the cycling unreliable when the M2 isn’t fully shouldered/supported (like when firing from the hip). Similar to “limp-wristing” a Glock. I remember those things. The joke at time was that it was called SPAS because a spase is what it is. (Slang at the time among teens for another kid that was socially awkward.) Never owned one, but I did own a Benelli M3 Super 90. Pump/auto. Neither fish nor fowl. Hated it. Disposed of it at the first gun show I could. Liked all the M1 Super 90s I owned. Let’s see 1500 in 2000 money adjusted for inflation to 2025 would be 2,785 so 2016 probably would have been the last reasonable price. RE: “Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004).” The old piss poor sporting purpose defense of the 2A all while not defining Gun Control by its History…how dare we embarrass our Gun Control colleagues. The Founders and millions of defenseless victims of Gun Control were rolling over in their graves. Thankfully Bush II let the clinton/biden Gun Control insanity sunset. As for Franchi they produce nice shotguns. I own one since 1996. There are easier shotguns to use in pump action and reload, but when you start shooting it fast in semiauto, the muzzle rise is minimal. Also the recoil is… tame. That thing shoots fast and straight. I love it, and after many thousands of rounds, tens of thousands, it still goes as new. Top!!! “Robust build”? Except for those parts made from plastic which are getting brittle with age. Plastic doesn’t get brittle. I’ve a pair of Glocks made in 1851 and they’re still as robust as they were when Wild Bill Hickok was using them. I forgot to say. $10,000 for one of these things?

Title: My Stock Market Abundance Plan

Time Published: 2025-04-27T13:00:16Z

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted April 27, 2025 by Ben Carlson I liked Abundance by Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein because the theme of the book is about doing stuff rather than scarcity. The big ideas from the book revolve around the fact that there’s too much red tape when it comes to things like housing, energy, healthcare and technology development. If nothing else, the idea of making it easier to build more housing is something I’m completely on board with. But there was one area of the book that was lacking — the stock market. I thought I could help these guys out and give them the Ben Carlson Stock Market Abundance Plan. Here’s the deal: Roughly 60% of American households own stocks but the top 10% owns 87% of the market. We need more people involved in the stock market. I have a two-part plan to make this happen. Just half of all Americans have savings in a retirement plan such as a 401k. We need to fix that. The Thrift Savings Plan is the defined-contribution retirement plan for federal government employees. It’s the best 401k plan there is. There are just five individual fund options, all extremely low-cost1 index funds — U.S. large cap, U.S. small cap, international, aggregate bond, and U.S. treasuries. Plus they have targedate funds made up of these fund options. The funds are managed by BlackRock and State Street. Why is this plan only available to government employees? It should be open to anyone with a job. Many employees have no access to a 401k. Part one of my abundance plan is that anyone who earns a paycheck and pays taxes has the ability to access the TSP retirement plan. In fact, you should be auto-enrolled and forced to opt out of the plan if you don’t wish to contribute. Part two of my plan involves a little more long-term thinking. I want $10,000 from the government into a Roth IRA account for every child born in America today. Don’t worry — there are stipulations on this account. It has to go into the stock market or a targetdate fund. You can’t touch it until age 21. And you can only take the money out at that age to pay for things like student loans, a down payment on a house or to start a business. Otherwise you have to let it ride in the market. After 21 years at 8% growth, $10k turns into $50k. Over 30 years, $10k turns into $100k. Just think about how helpful that would be to young people trying to get their footing in life. It would ease the burden on parents. It would allow young people to take more risks. It would make it easier for them to start a life after school. Would it be expensive? Yeah but it’s an investment in our future. Are there things I haven’t accounted for in my analysis? Sure. But I don’t want the stock market to be just a place for the upper echelon of society. The top 1% owns 50% of the stock market. The bottom 50% owns 1% of the stock market. We should make it easier for more people to save for retirement and invest in the stock market. That’s my abundance plan. Michael and I spoke to Derek about the book, how it relates to the current environment, trade wars and more: ﻿ Podcast version here: 1The small cap fund costs 5 basis points.

Title: The implications of Trump’s big bet on tariffs

Editor’s Note: President Donald Trump’s massive wager on tariffs with your money came together over years. It took just days to fall apart. This is Part 4 of an in-depth, contemporaneous look at the first 100 days of Trump’s second term. When the stock market started chewing through retirement accounts like a wheat thresher, business owners began howling about the risk of ruination, and economic analysts commenced clanging warning bells of a possible worldwide recession, many political watchers thought surely President Donald Trump would take notice. They were certain he would finally see the existential danger of slapping punishing tariffs on scores of countries and step back from his potentially catastrophic plan. Instead, in the 10th week of his new term, the 47th president is leaning into his latest favorite metaphor: that international trade is a high-stakes card game and he is the master strategist. Only he knows which countries hold a strong hand, which do not, and how bets should be placed. And he is laying down a massive wager. “For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he proclaims to an adoring crowd of Republican VIPs. They have assembled at the White House to celebrate what he calls his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Up at the podium, Trump gleefully displays a chart thick with numbers purporting to show just how much each country will pony up for access to the great American marketplace. But experts who have played the trade game much longer quickly call Trump’s big move on the second day of April a fool’s bet — one that could poison US trade relations with those friendly partners he mentioned and open the door for less friendly competitors to capitalize on his misstep. Skeptics say Trump is flirting with the kind of failure that can unwind a presidency. Trump meets their warnings with a jutted jaw and declarations that he will not blink. To understand how Trump came so quickly to such a perilous spot after much talk, many threats and occasional applications of tariffs in much smaller degrees, it’s worth considering what those close to him have said for years. He truly believes the ability to tax imported goods is a near-mythical power to wipe away trade deficits, stop illegal immigration, control trafficking in illicit drugs, and make the world bow to his will. Aside from military force, he seems to see tariffs as the most direct way a president can rule over not just the United States, but everyone, everywhere. “I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said back on Inauguration Day just as he had on the campaign trail, “because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.” It’s an intriguing claim considering how little good came out of his initial tilt with tariffs. Over the four years of Trump’s first term, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping took turns levying tariffs on pork, solar panels, steel pipes, fruit, nuts, intellectual property, recycled aluminum and more. They eventually worked out an agreement, satisfying Trump’s need to declare himself the master negotiator. But subsequent studies found the promise he extracted for China to buy an additional $200 billion in US goods and services went almost entirely unfulfilled. President Joe Biden maintained those tariffs, but as a practical matter, Trump’s first trade war ended in a draw. Still, this time around Team Trump insists it is making a bigger, longer play. By squeezing world markets simultaneously, the US will drive other countries away from their protectionist tendencies. Better trade balances will follow. Jobs that once moved away from America to find cheaper labor will come back to avoid higher import fees. Gleaming new factories will spring up like wildflowers. Trump will triumph. “Remember the armies of millions of millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones? That kind of thing is going to come to America!” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick says on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” raising the specter of factories full of laborers as a grand vision for the future. But then Lutnick clarifies: Any modern factories will undoubtedly include massive amounts of automation. He’s talking about other, better jobs for the people he says will benefit from Trump’s big tariff gamble. “High school-educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.” For many economists, labor analysts and technology specialists, it is a laughably far-fetched idea. Even if tariffs can offset some of the lower wages elsewhere, big investments in big properties — such as manufacturing plants — take years, even if investors are fully confident in the political stability of the host nation. What’s more, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden had already boosted American manufacturing jobs to higher levels than Trump ever saw in his first term. Indeed, 20% of domestic factories that are underproducing say a shortage of workers is to blame. By 2033, some researchers say more than half of all new manufacturing jobs in the US could be unfilled. CNN’s Matt Egan, one of the most astute economic reporters around, spoke to a former Ford executive and came away with a cautionary tale. Even that giant of American auto production “had trouble finding qualified workers to work in their assembly plants,” Egan says. And some of those they did find? “They ended up quitting because they didn’t realize just how difficult the job would be.” In a broad sense, Trump is right to say many of America’s once-thriving, old-fashioned factory towns descended into dust and decay in part because other countries used tariffs to protect their manufacturing industries. Some statistics show that most of America’s big trading partners have higher import fees, making US goods more costly and putting US exporters at a disadvantage. But there is precious little evidence to support Trump’s notion that America’s future economic glory will come from pushing its citizens back to assembly lines that, based on his descriptions, often sound like the kind of heavy production of the post-World War II years. And make no mistake: Despite everything Trump says, foreign nations will not pay all these tariffs. Instead, economic analysts overwhelmingly say American consumers will foot most of the monumental bill for what those experts call Trump’s taxes. Perhaps it should be no surprise then, that within days of Trump’s “Liberation” event, even nominal friends who supported him in the election are skimming wild cards toward the president’s carefully stacked tariff deck. “We’ve got to become friends with Canada again,” Joe Rogan says on one of the most popular podcasts in the world with millions of listeners per episode. “I can’t believe that there is anti-American and anti-Canadian sentiment going on. This is the dumbest f**king feud.” “The idea that this is good and makes the American economy inherently stronger is wrongheaded,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro says to his own vast audience. “Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impose hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on Americans without public or congressional input.” Estimates start appearing in the news about cars costing thousands of dollars more; the price of televisions, bananas, clothing, computers and sporting goods skyrocketing. Considering that voters’ anger over inflation helped propel Trump back to the White House, the idea that he would risk driving prices into the stratosphere with such a big, early move is alarming to even some GOP lawmakers. “High prices are obviously something no one wants to pay — I understand the concern they have,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, tells CNN while nodding to the hope that other countries might cave to Trump’s demands before the worst hits the home front. On the Democratic side, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky says the damage is already being done by Trump’s weeks of threatening tariffs, imposing them, then pausing them. “It’s the uncertainty,” McGarvey says. “It’s the on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again. … Our phones are ringing off the hook right now. People see their 401(k)s, they see their college funds for their kids just cratering.” CNN’s Jamie Gangel sees lawmakers of all stripes looking at the days and weeks ahead and quaking. “They don’t know what Donald Trump is going to wake up and decide.” The Yale Budget Lab says Trump’s tariffs will raise costs for the average American family by $3,800 annually. Some analysts picking apart how the administration calculated those retaliatory tariff rates noted the tariff formula released by the White House seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a formula generated by ChatGPT. As if to underscore the administration’s seemingly slapdash approach, the Trump plan is found to include a 10% tariff on some Antarctic islands where there are no people. Only penguins. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump in the election, posts his concerns online. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war,” Ackman writes, “we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country.” The metric for fear on Wall Street (there really is such a thing) is pegging at levels not seen since Covid-19 shattered global supply chains. The stock market is splashing red across newscasts, showing $6 trillion in lost value over a week. Respected financial institutions are putting the odds of a recession well above 50%. Even Elon Musk takes an apparent swing at Trump’s call for a 20% tariff on Europe. The richest man in the world — and a top adviser to the president — tells a right-wing political conference in Italy he’d like to see a “zero tax situation … a free trade zone between Europe and North America.” A chief architect and defender of Trump’s tariff policy, Peter Navarro, suggests Musk is trying to protect his electric car business. The Tesla CEO calls Navarro a “moron … dumber than a sack of bricks.” Musk will later apologize — to bricks. “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” the president posts on Truth Social, pushing for a rally. At a fundraiser for congressional Republicans, he insists the White House is being flooded with messages from abroad. “I know what the hell I’m doing,” Trump says, implying that his refusal to give an inch is paying off, as Republican lawmakers keep praising his steel spine. “These countries are calling us up, kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” the leader of the free world says as if he is about to lay his winning hand on the table Less than 24 hours later, he folds. The president imposes a 90-day suspension for many of the tariffs he had declared nonnegotiable. It happens so suddenly that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is testifying in a congressional hearing when he hears about the new strategy. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, rips into the White House witness for claiming to know what was happening — and then seeming just as surprised as everyone else. “WTF! Who’s in charge?” Horsford shouts. “There is no strategy! This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop!” Amid reports that an alarming shift in the bond market — a key pillar of US economic power — is what made Trump retreat, the president’s team insists he did not buckle at all. Although many were praising him hours earlier for refusing to budge on his tariff demands, they are now crowing about his wily genius. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says this was Trump’s “strategy all along.” Brilliant. The ultimate dealmaker. The praise is unending among Republicans, and the financial markets come surging back for their best day in 16 years. Trump declares victory. In the cold light of morning, reality returns. Commentators outside the MAGA echo sphere start saying all Trump did was push the world dangerously close to an economic disaster and then proclaim himself a hero for backing away from the calamity he created. The prediction of the Yale Budget Lab adjusts upward — now placing the annual tariff tax on families at $4,700. To make matters worse, some analysts say Trump’s brash bet substantially weakened the faith of other nations in the reliability of the US government. “Biggest winner is China. Hands down.” On the “Pivot” podcast, which scrutinizes the intersection of business, tech and politics, entrepreneur and New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway pulls no punches. “Every Chinese diplomat and businessman … they’re all working overtime and they’re going to European capitals; they’re going everywhere … and they are saying, ‘You may not agree with us, but you know what? We’re good partners.’” Analysts note, through all the ups and downs, the financial markets have still not returned to Inauguration Day levels when all of Trump’s tariff talk was still theory. What’s more, a social media post from Trump saying “this is a great time to buy” a few hours before his about-face brings accusations of illegal insider trading, to which the White House accuses Democrats of playing “partisan games.” In addition, when it becomes clear how many tariffs have not been suspended, and how China is now facing at least a whopping 145% fee to send goods into the US, the markets nosedive again. China calls Trump’s policies a “joke,” strikes back with its own 125% tariff on US goods, and financial experts refuse to lower their predictions of a possible recession. Indeed, Larry Fink, the CEO of the gargantuan, global investment company BlackRock, says on CNBC in mid-April, “I think we are very close, if not in a recession now.” Trump says he’s waiting on a call from China to discuss some sort of deal, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.” But it appears they don’t — at least not at the levels they did when voters put him back into office. A University of Michigan study, taken before the tariff uproar, is released and shows consumer sentiment at its second lowest level since 1952 with fears of inflation charging upward. Farmers go back to worrying about what will happen to overseas sales of their crops. Businesspeople return to fretting about rising costs and ebbing sales. Working families brace for it all to come crashing down on their bank accounts. Less than one hundred days into his second turn at the presidency, Donald Trump has bet the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Americans on his deep affection for tariffs. He has started the most significant trade war in generations. It is not clear whether he can end it. CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion."

More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis. In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Comments from the Trump administration about some negotiations on Chinese tariffs and rumors of impending trade deals with India and Japan boosted stocks. The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports. US Dollar Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet’s results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%. 1Q 2025 US Economic Growth Estimates A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn’t invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchases will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchases at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren’t the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic. Measures Of US Economic Activity The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and first quarter earnings release are this weekend. While Warren Buffett has avoided discussing politics recently, he might be willing to provide some insights into the expected impact on Berkshire’s diversified group of businesses.

Title: It’s Time To Buy Muni Bond Funds—Here’s Why And Where

ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Good news for savers in fairly high tax brackets: Yields on municipal bonds are good, comfortably ahead of what you can clear from Treasury bonds. Bad news: This is a treacherous field. It is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. For tax-sheltered accounts like IRAs, munis are inappropriate; there, use this survey of taxable bonds and bond funds. For taxable accounts, munis are a buy. Says Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in ten years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early (see rule #3 below), but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. What about that talk of making interest on all state and municipal debt federally taxable (for the first time)? Haskell: “Am I threatened? No.” If this happens, he says, existing bonds will be grandfathered. And if the wise people in Congress decree that henceforth states and cities can issue only taxable debt, his job is not over. The same sewers and school buildings would have to be financed, and the clientele for the bonds would expand to include investors who don’t touch them now, like foreigners and endowment funds. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. This fund survey aims to make the investment easy. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: We narrow the roster of those worth looking at to 40. First, exchange-traded funds, the newer kind of fund that until recently had scarcely anything to offer to muni investors. Here’s a list of 24 of them. These ETFs have annual expense burdens no higher than 0.18%. They each average a daily trading volume of at least $1 million, meaning that you can probably get in and out without getting eaten alive by the bid/ask spread: The older style of fund is a mutual fund. No-load mutuals impose no trading costs but tend to have higher expense ratios. Alas, the subset of municipal-bond mutuals with bargain expense ratios is tiny. All of the funds shown here come from Vanguard. Note: Where Vanguard has both a small-stakes share class starting at $3,000 and a large-stakes version for buyers putting in $50,000, the table displays only the latter. There are two problems with individual tax-exempt bonds. One is that they are hard to research. The IOU you thought was backed by a city or state may in fact be backed only by the revenue from a decrepit nursing home. Do you really want to spend your free time reading fine print? The other matter is that muni bonds are hard to trade. You were perhaps planning to hold until redemption, but things happen. You might need to raise cash. Or you might want to take a tax loss during a spike in interest rates. To get an idea of what befalls small investors trying to sell, take a look at the bond offerings on your brokerage platform. How many are listed as available for sale but with no quote on the bid side? A blank spot for the bid is an indication that, if you need to unload in a hurry, you will get hosed by a middleman. Cashing out a muni fund, in contrast, is easy. To swap for a tax loss, find a substitute fund that isn’t exactly the same. Example: Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond Index behaves much like iShares National Muni Bond but is sufficiently different that the IRS can’t call the swap a wash. After 31 days you can go back where you were, if you want to. It’s easy to find a well-managed fund costing an annual 0.1% or less. It might make sense to pay a little more to get what you want in duration (rate risk) or timing (as with those target-date funds). But not a lot more. Don’t be led astray by the double-tax-free allure of a fund holding only home-state bonds. State income tax rates are usually less than 10%, and muni yields about 4%. There is, that is, not a lot of state tax to be avoided. Kentucky’s flat tax rate is 4%, so the most that a rational Kentucky resident would pay in incremental cost to avoid local tax is 4% of 4%, or 0.16%. How curious that holders of the class C shares of the Nuveen Kentucky Municipal Bond fund pay 1.93% in annual fees, 64 times what they’d pay to hold a muni bond index ETF from Vanguard. Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary, has another 24 single-state funds on offer for the mathematically challenged. Simple rule of thumb: If Vanguard has a single-state fund for your state, buy it. If Vanguard doesn’t, buy a national fund. The customary practice for a state or city borrowing money is to offer a fairly high coupon on a bond due in 30 years, while reserving the right to call the bond in early beginning in 10 years. For the bond issuer this arrangement is rather nice. For the bond buyer it’s awful. It turns the investment into a heads-you-break-even, tails-you-lose proposition. If interest rates go down, the issuer calls in the bond. That is, the buyer has the good coupon for only 10 years. If rates go up, the issuer stands pat, leaving the buyer stuck for another 20 years at a below-market yield. This unwanted 20-year bond will trade at a discount. The lopsided set of possible outcomes makes quite a contrast to the bet on a noncallable 30-year Treasury bond. Long Treasuries are risky, but the risk is symmetric. They fall in value if interest rates climb, but they are just as likely to rise in value as interest rates go down. Muni owners should be cognizant that they have made asymmetric bets on interest rates. In other words: Muni bond yields overstate expected returns. By how much? To properly answer that question you need to assess, using each bond’s coupon, call date and maturity date, the effect of 10,000 possible paths that interest rates might take between now and 2055, and assign a probability to each path. Such a calculation would be a bit impractical. But you can get a sense of how harmful call provisions are by observing how much compensation investors demand for putting up with them. For AAA-rated munis the yield curve (2 years out versus 30 years) is 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, steeper than the yield curve for Treasuries. A portfolio of long-dated callable bonds has embedded in it some appreciable fraction of that 50 basis points as an expected loss from rate volatility. The following table of net yields aims to deliver rough justice to the situation. It debits the officially reported yields on long-term muni funds for an estimate of call damage. Taxes are allowed for, as well, at different income levels, in two high-tax states. Conclusion: For people in moderately high or very high tax brackets, municipal debt is usually more rewarding than Treasury debt. It’s just not quite as good a deal as bond salesmen would have you believe. The 22% federal bracket, which starts at $96,950 of taxable income on a joint return, is where muni bond interest begins to beat out Treasury bond interest. In the next bracket up, 24%, most couples are also paying a 3.8% investment tax, for a combined federal rate of 27.8%. What about the alternative minimum tax? This affliction largely evaporated with the passage of the 2017 tax law. If the problem reappears, which would happen if Congress fails to extend that law, AMT is still likely to matter only in money-market muni funds and in high-yield muni funds. In short, it’s not worth paying extra fees to get a fund labeled “AMT-free.” State rates, which never apply to U.S. Treasury interest and usually but not always apply to interest on out-of-state municipal bonds, range from 0% to 14.8%. Two states with stiff taxes, New York and California, are home to low-fee double-tax-free funds. New York bonds have pretty good yields. California yields, however, are not terrific and investors there are often better off buying a national muni fund. A peculiarity of the tax code gives fund investors an advantage over bond investors. Say a bond comes out at par and sinks to 90 cents on the dollar as rates rise. If you buy at 90 and redeem at 100, the 10-point gain is taxed as ordinary income (which is totally unfair). Now let’s say a fund buys bonds at 100 and, as interest rates rise, the bonds fall in price to 90 and the fund shares fall in price from $100 to $90. You buy the fund at $90 and see its shares gradually recover as its bonds mature and get cashed out at par. You now sell the fund at $100. Your $10 gain is taxed at the lower capital gain rate.

Title: Trade-war panic is so overblown that it's a great time to buy, these Wall Street strategists say

Thanks to the trade war, Americans are feeling downright awful about the economy. The latest University of Michigan consumer survey reported an 8% decline in sentiment from March, as consumers worried about inflation, unemployment, and their financial situation. It's not only consumers — the American Association of Individual Investors recently reported the 12th consecutive week of a negative bull-bear spread, meaning that more investors were bearish than bullish on the stock market. However, a growing cohort of market experts is shunning the doom-and-gloom narrative that the economy is on a collision course with recession. In their opinion, the bad vibes aren't quite aligning with reality. After all, corporate earnings are strong, the labor market is in good shape, and households have robust balance sheets. Their advice? Don't let the negative news discourage you from buying into the stock market at a discount now. Often, overly bearish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator for a market rebound. Here's why these four strategists are keeping a cool head on tariffs and are ultimately optimistic about the market. To Levine, extremely low investor sentiment means that it's unlikely for markets to fall much further. "Recession's on everybody's lips, and in some ways, that's a really good thing because, as you know, when the market is expecting something, the news of it itself is less likely to cause a downside whoosh," Levine told BI. "The market has de-risked a lot of the downside scenarios." Ultimately, the stock market crash and negative sentiment are all self-inflicted by Trump, meaning that there's nothing wrong with the underlying economy, Levine said. On the bright side, any change in policy can also greatly reduce the chance of a recession. Trump has shown himself amenable to negotiations, as he floated the idea of scaling back tariffs on China earlier this week. Levine believes that some sort of tariff deal will be struck before the 90-day tariff pause is up. "There's some expectation that this is the peak of the tariffs, and so, as those move lower, that would seem to feed into the sense that there is right tail here," Levine said. DeSpirito, who oversees several income and value funds including the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), has never been too concerned about Trump tariffs ruining the economy. Back in March, DeSpirito said on Bloomberg that it was a mistake for banks to be downgrading their stock market outlooks, and he's held steady to that view. "Periods of uncertainty are actually great buying opportunities. Once the uncertainty abates, companies are very adaptive," DeSpirito told BI. Right now, DeSpirito is seeing opportunities in healthcare services, medical devices, aerospace, and defense companies. "In healthcare, I'm finding a lot more opportunity in services than I am in large-cap pharma. Large cap pharma has a lot of issues around where they locate their intellectual property," DeSpirito said. "A number of them have large patent expirations that are upcoming." DeSpirito thinks the market is overly focused on the risk and overlooking opportunities down the road. He's confident that kinks in trade policy will be ironed out soon. "In addition to greater certainty around trade, you'll also get deregulation, which will be a positive for the market and when you think about tariffs as a source of revenue, that revenue source will create more flexibility on the policy side," DeSpirito said. Tariff concerns have led many investors to diversify outside the US stock market, but Curtis believes the "sell America" narrative is overblown. Instead of fleeing to international stocks, Curtis believes investors should be doubling down on US leaders like the Magnificent Seven. Especially now that many of the Big Tech names are down roughly 20% from all-time highs, Curtis sees a good opportunity for investors to add to their positions in high-quality companies for cheap. "This productivity gain that we're going to get from artificial intelligence is going to be profound and those companies, many of them Mag 7, hold the keys to that," Curtis said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. Curtis is also bullish on defensive sectors like healthcare, where demand for treatments will remain constant no matter what part of the economic cycle we're in. He sees innovations in GLP-1 medications and AI driving sustained future growth for the healthcare sector. "Those businesses are as good as they were over the long term prior to Inauguration Day, and those companies are incredibly well-positioned for what's about to come," Curtis said of the Magnificent Seven. It's easy to buy into a doomsday recession narrative, but Schulze doesn't see much evidence to back it up. There's been a lot of talk about how consumer sentiment is at historic lows, but actions are more important than sentiment itself, he said. "In this cycle in particular, it's more important to watch what people do rather than what they say, because when you look at the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, it's been low and declining, yet consumption has been fairly broad-based over the last couple of years," Schulze said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. US consumers might not feel so optimistic, but numbers show they're in great shape. Household debt levels are low, and many homeowners locked in low mortgage rates, insulating them from their biggest monthly expense, according to Schulze. "This is a great opportunity to be dollar-cost averaging into the weakness that we've seen," Schulze said. "A lot of negativity has been priced in a short period of time for US equities, and I don't see any structural excesses in the economy that would cause a deep recession." Jump to

Tokenized U.S. treasuries have now reached a new all-time high of $6.16 billion in value. Amid the booming tokenized real-world asset market, it appears that only a few major players are controlling the overall market. According to data from the real-world asset platform rwa.xyz, tokenized U.S. treasuries have now reached a new all-time high of $6.16 billion in value. Tokenized U.S. treasuries on the blockchain were valued at $4.01 billion in January 2025. Since then, their value has surged by 53.62%, reaching $6.16 billion. This sharp increase highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in blockchain as a tool for modernizing fixed-income markets. The data also reveals that six entities—BlackRock BUIDL, Franklin Templeton BENJI, Superstate USTB, Ondo USDY, Circle USYC, and Ondo OUSG—control 88% of all tokenized U.S. treasuries. BlackRock’s BUIDL, representing the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, has emerged as the industry leader in blockchain-based U.S. treasuries. It holds a market capitalization of $2.5 billion, making it 360% larger than the next biggest fund. The other top contenders are: Collectively, these six funds control 88% of all tokenized U.S. treasuries issued, underscoring their dominance in the space. Source: rwa.xyz Superstate’s USTB has seen a significant rise in market capitalization, increasing by 57.99% over the past thirty days. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s BUIDL has experienced rapid adoption, growing by 291% from the 1st of January to the 26th of April 2025, and now accounts for 41% of the total market. Data shows Ethereum is the primary blockchain for BUIDL, holding 91% of its total supply, or nearly $2.30 billion. Other networks supporting BUIDL include Aptos[APT] ($53.30 million), Avalanche[AVAX] ($52.80 million), and Polygon [POL] ($33.10 million). Launched in March 2024, BUIDL provides daily dividends derived from short-term U.S. Treasury investments. Each BUIDL token is fully backed by U.S. dollars, delivering Treasury-like returns while functioning similarly to a stablecoin.

Title: BTC Price Action Tightens: Market In Consolidation Phase Ahead Of A Potential Break

This week, markets across the board have remained relatively calm, with price action reflecting a clear consolidation phase. The Nasdaq, for instance, has formed an inside bar on the weekly chart, meaning the current candle is trading within the high and low of last week's range. This often signals indecision or a buildup before a larger move. Bitcoin is following a similar pattern. After several weeks of upward movement, the cryptocurrency has entered a tight trading range, consolidating just below key resistance levels. This type of price behavior typically precedes a breakout, and the direction of that breakout could set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move. Don't Miss: Weekly Analysis: Bitcoin Trading Within a Defined Range On the higher timeframe, Bitcoin remains locked within a clear weekly range. Earlier this week, it dipped below the swing low from March 10, capturing liquidity beneath that level before bouncing back. This kind of price action suggests that buyers are still active and willing to step in at lower prices. However, Bitcoin has not yet pushed through the key range high near 88,742. This level has now acted as resistance twice, reinforcing its importance. If price returns to this area, how it reacts will be crucial. A clean break above it could open the door to a move toward the 92,000s and possibly set the stage for a run toward all-time highs. On the other hand, another rejection could mark the formation of a local top and increase the chances of a deeper pullback. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Key Levels and Market Scenarios to Watch As of now, Bitcoin is holding above 83,000, showing signs of strength despite the consolidation. If it continues to trade above this level and gains momentum, the next upside targets to monitor are 88,000 and then the 92,000s. These levels will be essential in determining whether the current consolidation leads to continuation or reversal. Should Bitcoin break below 83,000 with conviction, particularly on daily closes, a move down toward the low 80,000s becomes likely. If that support fails to hold, price could revisit the mid-74,000s, an area of previous consolidation and strong demand. For bullish momentum to remain intact in the bigger picture, Bitcoin needs to stay above 66,000, which marked the low around the election period. As long as price holds above this key higher low, the broader uptrend remains in place, and any pullbacks can be viewed as potential buying opportunities. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Wrapping Up Bitcoin is currently in a state of pause after a strong run-up, with price coiling beneath resistance and holding above key support. This kind of consolidation often precedes a decisive move, and traders should be prepared for volatility to return once the range is broken. Whether the breakout comes to the upside or downside will depend on the strength of the next move around the 88,000 and 83,000 zones. As always, staying patient and reactive to price behavior at these key levels will be critical for navigating the next phase in Bitcoin's trend. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: Letters: Stories in ink on paper have no equal in these days of 24/7 news

There is something very satisfying about having a newspaper in your hands. Photo: Getty Sunday Independent newspaper Sir — Reading news printed on paper is not the same as listening to news on the radio or looking at it on the television or on your phone. Buying a newspaper in a shop, holding a newspaper or placing it on a table to read, turning the pages, choosing the order in which you read it, doing the crossword, placing a cup of tea in the middle of the page you’re not reading, cutting out an article to keep, folding the newspaper or rolling it and putting it in your back pocket, putting it in the recycle bin, or the tempus fugit frisson you get when you open and read a crumpled ball of newspaper once used to wrap a rediscovered vase in the attic — have no equivalents in other media modalities. Newsprint on paper has a physicality all of its own. Newspapers hold a mirror to society; they also hold a lamp — to expose what is ignored or what lies hidden or buried or forgotten. The quality of newspapers is an indicator of the quality of a society. In a world of 24/7 newsfeed, Sunday newspapers occupy a special place — more content, more investigative scoops, more reflective, more glossy, more supplements, more entertainment, more time to read, more news. Newspaper journalists and editors are key workers who provide an essential service; we saw this during Covid and we see it every time there is a crisis; we also see it when we look at countries where newspapers and media are organs of propaganda or in places where journalists are denied access. Being a newspaper journalist or editor is a challenging job, not least having to compete for readers who are being bombarded on all sides by free, fake, sensationalist news. In this context I would like to thank you, in your final edition, on the job you did as editor of the Sunday Independent. Chris Fitzpatrick, Terenure Road East, Dublin 6 Sir — Pope Francis ­re-energised Catholicism by ­living a simple life based on gospel values. By his energy, ­humanity, openness, humility, compassion, repentance and reforms, he regained the confidence of the flock. His successor needs to be cut from the same cloth as him. The decline in active priests ­requires consolidation and best use of its resources by the Catholic Church. Goodwill and generosity of spirit are required at all levels of the church, which must continue to adapt and modernise to meet the spiritual needs of contemporary society. Gender inequality and compulsory celibacy are denying the faithful the service of many fine individuals who would make ­excellent priests. Women have given outstanding ­service, devotion and loyalty to the church, but are denied ordination. Imag­ine the reinvigoration and energy, in addition to a substantial increase in available priests, that would permeate all levels of the church if women could become priests. A priest should always have the right to remain single but should also be entitled to marry. Likewise, ordination should be available to a married person. In a society where the role of the Catholic Church must be predominantly pastoral and inclusive, the sacraments of holy orders and matrimony can no longer be mutually exclusive. Francis has ensured the sustainability of Catholicism into the future. It will be less ­influential in secular society. It must co-exist and co-operate with other religions and none. It will have to work hard to retain the confidence of the laity. However, as long as it’s grounded in Francis’s values of social justice, humility, altruism, equality and reconciliation, count me in as an active and committed member. Billy Ryle, Spa, Tralee, Co Kerry Sir — In 2005, Paddy O’Gorman on his radio programme interviewed a betting man in a Cork bookie shop who had landed a healthy accumulator a few weeks earlier. Pope John Paul II had died the previous day, and our friend decided to use the manna from heaven to attend the funeral. So off they popped, the pious punter, his wife and sister-in-law. Rome, of course, was packed with mourners — roadblocks and diversions everywhere, thousands at the checkpoints. But our Leeside trio were ushered forward at every turn, right up to the cortege and with the best viewing points wherever they went. Apparently, the authorities and security crews assumed they had come from Poland, the Pope’s homeland, and gave them preferential treatment. They were wearing their Cork GAA jerseys. Des Nix, Raheny, Dublin 5 Sir — I am sure Saint ­Francis of Assisi would be so proud of his namesake, our humble Pope Francis, for his empathy for the poor and marginalised. Looking back on his visit to Ireland in 2018, it was difficult for him as he didn’t have the ­euphoria that marked Pope John Paul II’s wonderful time here. At the state event in Dublin Caste to honour his visit, Francis sat thoughtfully listening to then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s warm welcoming words, which were also laced with pointed criticism of the Catholic Church. There was a sense he was being chastised for all the church’s failings in Ireland and, perhaps, even those of the State. Pope Francis, with humility and dignity, acknowledged the shared pain of what he called the “repugnant crimes” of ­clerical abuse. He also saw the fun and the good in the person, whether believer or not. His sense of hum­our must have lightened the heavy burden on his heart and soul. On Easter Sunday, no doubt gravely ill, he still was giving, praying and smiling. The world and the church will be the poorer for his leaving us. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin 18 Sir — On the passing of dear Pope Francis The TV flashback showed him visiting the Capuchin monks Who feed the poor and destitute. They interviewed a homeless person there; she said: “If I wasn’t homeless I would never have met the Pope.” Derek Seymour, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Sir — I happened to find ­myself in possession of two diff­erent sized Cadbury Twirl Easter eggs (retailing at €10 and €6 respectively) and discovered the two eggs were the same size and weight (155g). The only difference in content between the two eggs (apart from the obviousinflated packaging of the more expensive egg) was one Twirl bar. Orla Maguire, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — I googled “Who can be elected Pope?” and was advised that any baptised male could be elected. Is the church aware of the definition of misogyny? M McMahon, Malahide, Co Dublin Sir — Reading comments last Sunday concerning the general subject of letter-writing brought me back to the days when the handwritten letter was the norm. My late mother said to me on several occasions that very intelligent people in some instances had poor handwriting. Given my own scrawl, I always felt that in her subtle way she was reassur­ing me that intellectually I wasn’t quite a write-off. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Sir — Education Minister ­Helen McEntee’s recent threat to introduce legislation to compel schools to take in pupils with special needs is an attempt to distract from the real problem. There is not a school or teacher in Ireland that would refuse admission to children with special needs if the proper facilities were provided by the minister and her department. I acknowledge that there is a serious problem for parents trying to get places for their children. Compelling schools is not necessary and certainly not the solution. There have been a few small units built to cater for children with special needs, but now the department and the minister are no longer providing the necessary grants. Instead, they are suggesting that existing classrooms be used if there are spare ones. In discussion with two ­National Council For Special Education reps recently when I was chairman of a board of management, I asked them about the sensory provision for the pupils. “You can hang a ­curtain in the corner of the classroom,” was the reply I got. Such absurdity I have never heard in my 40 years of involvement with a school. This just proves that the department and the minister are more interested in getting the numbers up than providing the proper facilities. Schools, principals, teachers and boards are absolutely willing to take in children with special needs. Ms McEntee, you need to provide the funding to properly upgrade classrooms or provide the necessary funding to build new units. The solution is in your hands. Walter Lacey, Bullock Park, Carlow Sir — On buying your ­paper last weekend, I hurried to read the articles on Rory McIroy’s ­triumph at the ­Masters. ­Eamonn Sweeney, Tommy ­Conlon and Paul ­Kimmage were excellent, but Declan Lynch nailed it. John McCann, Donegal Sir — Tom Gilsenan (Letters, April 20) opines that there is “a donkey in the White House”. If I were The Donald, I would take that as a compliment of the highest order. Anyone familiar with donkeys will know of their unbelievable qualities: hard-working, calm in stressful situations, wonderful with children, low-maintenance, soothing company, productive. More “donkeys” and fewer high-maintenance temperamental racehorses are needed in ­positions of authority as far as I’m concerned. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir — Eilis O’Hanlon’s article last Sunday on trans ideology was a damning indictment of both government and opposition parties for their failure to acknowledge what the vast ­majority of people believe. The other elephant in the room that her same arguments apply to is illegal immigration. For the past number of years the last government (with Sinn Féin complicit by their silence) ­ignored the law of the land to the extent that there are now 6,000 asylum-seekers from safe countries Georgia and Algeria out of a total of 33,000 in the direct provision system. These numbers are unsustainable, even without impending tariffs. And all sides of the Dáil are silent — shame on them. Bernie Cronin, Clondalkin, Dublin 22 Sir — I was heartbroken by Maeve Sheehan’s report in last week’s Sunday Independent (‘Grace: Harrowing neglect of severely disabled young girl’).It seems to me that the HSE didn’t ward Grace due to the fact that this case was so bad, it was afraid of what would be disclosed. It must be very frightening for disabled people if they know that the agency entrusted with caring for them is going to keep secrets and is not going to be open, honest and transparent regarding their care. This presents immense fear for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters of many disabled people and for disabled people themselves. We must remember that disabled children are three to four times more likely to be abused. It is much more challenging if one doesn’t have a voice. However, we must always be cognisant of the fact that these children can communicate. They communicate by how they behave, so it’s a question of learning what that means. We can often pick up what is going on when a child is initially happy, and then all of a sudden their behaviour changes. Examples of such changes in behaviour are evident if a child starts to hit their head or if they start to bite or scratch. Doctors, nurses, social workers and gardaí need to be properly trained in this area . I would like to know the level of expertise that was involved in the Grace inquiry. It seems to me a lot of solicitors and barristers were involved and not a lot of specialists. There is a gap in our understanding of disability and abuse. If we don’t learn from the Grace case, we will find similar cases emerging. Perish the thought. John O’Brien, clinical psychotherapist, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Sir — Reading the Farrelly Commission report is very depressing. It is unconscionable that a state organisation entrusted with the protection of all vulnerable people should hide the truth to protect itself. We now know that some in the HSE have different ethical codes of practice. This is very worrying and alarming. Those of us who are whistleblowers and know the issues despair of a failed HSE system not fit for purpose. We demand urg­ent political action that leads to safeguarding of our most vulnerable citizens. Dr Margaret Kennedy, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — In recent times I have read advice from financial experts telling workers to join their work pension scheme as early as possible in their working life, as this will put them in a more favourable financial position when they retire. That is good advice. There is another side to this. When a worker starts to draw their pension, they may have a reasonable expectation that their pension payment would keep them within shouting distance of the increasing cost of living. However, my experience has not achieved that expectation. I retired in 2010 after 34 years working for a very profitable company. When I was working I received annual increases in pay, but since I retired my modest pension has not increased by one cent in 15 years. Having not received any increase in my pension payment, I contacted the company and was told that because the pension plan was in deficit, the company had “decided not to award a discretionary increase this year”. I am not a member of any trade union or retirement group. I am a lone voice without power, except for my trusty pen. I note that the CEO of this company is paid millions. The rich are getting richer. Don’t worry about the “old” people. David Riedy, Co Limerick Sir — David Quinn claims that protests on US university campuses “should not be euphemistically described as merely ‘pro-Palestinian’” (‘Student politics is no joke — radicals are sounding alarm bells’, April 20). He is correct, but for the wrong reasons. The protesters in question, like their fellow students elsewhere, are demonstrating in support of international humanitarian law and for ending the impunity that the state of Israel — plausiblyaccused of genocide by the International Court of Justice — enjoys, thanks to the unconditional support it receives from US and EU governments. It is natural that those who support that impunity should experience “hostility”, but to attribute such sensitivity to their being Jewish or Israeli is merelyto accept the Israeli state’s tactic of attributing all opposition to its crimes as antisemitic. In the days of South African apartheid, I’ve little doubt that supporters of white supremacism in South Africa suffered similar unease in the face of protests over racial equality. Raymond Deane, Dublin 7 Sir — David Quinn states that the “Boycott, Divest, Sanction” movement … essentially wants to destroy the Jewish State”. This is not true. Boycott, Div­estment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. It upholds the principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as everyone.

Join the leading maritime news network Ships move through the Suez Canal, on the Excellence Day, in Ismalia, Egypt, April 16, 2025. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh By María Paula Mijares Torres Apr 26, 2025 (Bloomberg) –President Donald Trump called for “free of charge” passage of American ships through the Panama and Suez canals, renewing his focus of expanding US influence over critical commercial and naval waterways. While Trump began pushing for an exit of Chinese port operators around the Panama Canal soon after returning to the White House in January, the post on his Truth Social network on Saturday also turned attention to the Suez Canal, which cuts through Egypt to link the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. “Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America,” Trump said, adding that he’s asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. Trump’s focus — with tariffs and other measures, such as proposed fees at US ports — has been on Chinese commercial shipping and shipbuilding, with the ultimate goal of promoting a revival of US shipbuilding. The US government argues that China’s dominance in ship construction was achieved unfairly and harms US interests. US commercial shipbuilding, once a global leader, has shriveled since the 1980s due to subsidy cuts and foreign competition.

Title: Will Starlink and other satellite companies eventually rival cellular carriers?

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onApril 26, 2025 Starlink has truly opened our eyes to the power of satellite technology, delivering speeds that rival cable internet in areas previously lacking high-speed options. But Starlink isn’t just about traditional internet use. Earlier this year, T-Mobile and Starlink introduced emergency satellite-to-cell features, including full texting, to mobile phone users for the first time. More recently, Verizon and some of its MVNOs followed suit with a more limited satellite-to-cell service launch for Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 users, in cooperation with Skylo. As satellite providers increasingly team up with major carriers, you might wonder: Will satellite technology ever surpass traditional services from big providers? It’s a compelling thought, but the reality is more complicated. Let’s take a closer look at the major players in the satellite-to-cell space, what they currently offer, and their publicly announced future plans. We’ll also explore the roadblocks holding satellite technology back in the mobile world and whether these issues might eventually become a thing of the past. Although numerous companies are involved in satellite technology, only a handful have directly pursued satellite-to-cell capabilities so far. Recently, Starlink has emerged as the most widely available service, even though its features remain in public beta. Nevertheless, several other companies have significant plans for satellite-to-cell technologies in the future. Starlink is best known for its internet service, but it has also become the biggest satellite-to-cell provider as it offers this service indirectly through partnerships, such as with T-Mobile in the US. The great thing about this partnership is that T-Mobile isn’t keeping satellite features exclusive, as it has allowed subscribers from rival networks to use the feature for free during beta. Skylo provides satellite connectivity across various industries through partnerships as opposed to having its own network. While it’s far from a major player in the satellite-to-cell game right now, Skylo most notably powers Verizon’s emergency SOS features on specific devices and is working with other cellular companies and phone makers to expand emergency SOS features. AST SpaceMobile aims to establish its own low-earth orbit satellite-to-cell network similar to Starlink, but it is still in early development. Unlike Starlink, which has over 7,000 satellites (approximately 400 equipped for cellular service), AST SpaceMobile has only launched five satellites capable of satellite-to-cell connectivity features. Iridium is known primarily for traditional satellite phone services, typically requiring specialized equipment for remote or field use. Currently, it offers the Iridium Go hotspot as a standalone device providing limited satellite-to-cell features, though at very slow speeds that are not suitable as a true cellular service replacement. For what it’s worth, we’ve seen other devices like the Go, including the HMD OffGrid. The big difference is that Iridium controls its own network. Iridium briefly partnered with Qualcomm to develop satellite-to-cell capabilities; however, after this partnership fell through, it shifted its attention toward other future collaborations. Globalstar is another major traditional satellite phone provider. While it continues to primarily focus on traditional satellite customers, it is actively pursuing the expanding satellite-to-cell market, notably through its partnership with Apple. To that end, Apple has invested over $1 billion in Globalstar to support satellite-to-cell features like emergency texting on iPhone 14 and newer devices. Likely, Globalstar will eventually extend its efforts to other manufacturers as well. In addition to already working with Skylo, ViaSat also plans to work with it and other partners on its own constellation of low-orbit satellites that will be designed to connect directly to smartphones and IoT devices without requiring ground infrastructure. This system was successfully tested last year through Skylo in the United Arab Emirates, India, and Saudi Arabia, and so it’s only a matter of time before the company ramps up the effort. While HughesNet doesn’t seem to be pursuing satellite-to-cell partnerships with carriers or manufacturers in any major way just yet, that doesn’t mean it isn’t involved at all. HughesNet currently offers its SatCell Connect service for first responders and field use. As you can see, there are plenty of efforts underway to roll out satellite-to-cell technology. For the most part, partnerships remain the favored approach. Given the current trajectory, it’s unlikely that satellite technology will replace terrestrial cellular service anytime soon, if ever. One major reason is that satellite technology often faces larger regulatory hurdles than the cellular industry. This is especially true for low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. LEO constellations are crucial because they are the only type even theoretically capable of replacing terrestrial service. Traditional satellites suffer from latency and speed limitations that make such a replacement effort impractical. Even if we move past regulatory and technical challenges, there are several inherent advantages to traditional cellular service that are difficult to overcome: To be fair, Starlink’s latency isn’t that much worse than that of broadband (at least compared to regular sat), which suggests latency could become a non-issue over time. But capacity remains a major obstacle and solving it would likely require blanketing the sky with billions of satellites. That’s not just expensive, it’s also a future filled with space junk. And although satellite deployment costs may drop over time, land-based infrastructure will almost always be the more economical option. The truth is, satellite providers don’t want to replace traditional cellular service, and you shouldn’t want that either. The ideal model is a hybrid approach, where carriers provide both ground and satellite coverage. While it’s possible that some carriers may eventually develop their own satellite networks, the infrastructure investment would be massive and likely not worth the cost. From a consumer perspective, there’s no real advantage to satellite-only service either. Let’s be honest: most people don’t care (or even want to know) how their phone connects, as long as it works. In the future, satellite backup will likely become so seamless and integrated that you won’t be able to tell whether you’re connected to a ground tower or a satellite, aside from maybe a latency spike or a small indicator on your phone. And that’s the beauty of it: the ability to connect from anywhere. That’s far more appealing than a future reliant on just satellites or towers.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Motorola's Razr 2025 series dropped, Alphabet's Q1 earnings soar, Meta layoffs impact VR teams, Samsung's summer Unpacked could take place in New York, and Android 16's Beta 4 comes out. Let's dive in. Read more here There's a new Motorola Razr on the block. The Motorola Razr 2025 series arrived this week as a trio for the first time. Showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra. All three devices are bolstered with Moto AI, which is backed by Perplexity AI. The devices also have access to Google's Gemini suite as well. At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance. Razr Ultra: Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in four colorways: Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret. With its premium specs, the Ultra starts at $1,299 and comes with dual storage options of 512GB and 1TB, along with 16GB of RAM. Razr Plus: Razr's premium model just got demoted to being the middle child. This year's Plus variant comes with almost the same specs as last year. With an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display. The Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink. The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, similar to the Razr Plus 2024. It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99. Razr 2025: As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky. The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen. At its core, the phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7400X, a notch higher than its predecessor. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor. The standard model is priced at $699.99, with prices varying based on the carrier in the U.S. and Canada. The Motorola Razr 2025 series will be sold in stores starting May 15. Pre-orders begin on May 7 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store. Along with its clamshells, the company also launched the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer. Read more here Alphabet, Google's parent company, released its Q1 earnings on Thursday (April 24), and it was reported that the company's revenue saw a 12% hike year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed later that evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion. Google's core businesses, including Search, YouTube advertising, and AI, were sizable contributors to this overall growth. "We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai Google's Search also saw a gain of $50.7 billion in revenue, YouTube's advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company, and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion. And Google Cloud also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. During the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products, specifically AI Overviews. Read more here Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for Meta’s Quest VR headsets. In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said. These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added. Employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, were among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well. They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged." Read more here A new rumor suggests that Samsung could be taking its mid-year Unpacked event to New York. According to a Korean news site, The JoongAng Daily, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with its new set of foldables, Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July. NYC could allegedly be playing host after three long years. The last time an Unpacked event was held in the location was back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. An industry insider familiar with Samsung's plan told the publication that, "This time, it will be held again in New York, the most representative cultural city, after three years." There is speculation that the Korean OEM could be switching things up to prioritize the U.S. market. Read more here Earlier this week, Google rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support. The latest update didn't bring any significant changes, as Google is gearing up to launch the stable version of its OS this summer. Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, which fixes two bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. It fixes a weird battery drain, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also tends to certain system stability issues and random launcher crashes that some folks were dealing with. However, a few Pixel users have taken to Reddit to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on: Nandika Ravi is an Editor for Android Central.

Title: 5 Dividend Stocks That Are Bucking The Bear Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/04/26/5-dividend-stocks-that-are-bucking-the-bear-market/

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Let’s talk about consumer staples dividend stocks today. If we’re heading for a slowdown then we need to be picky about our payouts. When the economy slows, discretionary spending is often punted but staples continue to be bought. Today we’ll discuss five dividends between 4.2% and 10.7%. These “must have” products can provide our portfolios with important recession-resistant qualities. Year-to-date staples have been flat and, in this market, that is great. Their sideways action has lapped the over-owned S&P 500 this year: XLP Total Returns Ycharts Consumer staples stocks tend to have more stable operations that result in more stable share performance in turbulent markets. And they also have predictable profits that allow them to pay out better-than-average dividends. But there are exceptions. Perpetually too-popular staples like Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT) deliver sub-1% yields. This also drags down the yields of staples-focused funds. This is why we cherry pick our payouts, as always. Let’s get into these five which yield up to 10.7%. Smokers are going to keep smoking, which is why these two tobacco companies have delivered double-digit gains (against the market’s 15% decline!) since Feb. 19: Altria (MO, 6.9% yield) is best-known for its Philip Morris USA segment, which produces Marlboro cigarettes and is by far and away the company’s top revenue driver. But the company is putting increasing focus on its smokeless products, which include Copenhagen and Skoal smokeless tobacco, On! Oral nicotine pouches, NJOY e-vapor products and—through a joint venture with JT Group called Horizon Innovations—heated tobacco products. Altria has been battling volume declines in cigarettes for years, and it has suffered a few self-inflicted wounds, such as its ill-fated stake in Juul Labs. However, higher prices on cigarettes, as well as growth in its smokeless products, have helped keep earnings and its high dividend on the rise, and both are expected to continue their (admittedly slow) growth in 2025. MO Earnings Growth Ycharts Ever since the market started sliding in February, investors have been snapping up MO shares to get some of that stability. But Altria is getting expensive—yes, a forward P/E of 11 doesn’t scream “overbought,” but it’s noticeably higher than the 8x-9x valuation it has typically carried over the past few years. British American Tobacco (BTI, 7.5% yield) owns a number of well-known cigarette brands, including Camel, American Spirit and Newport. But it too deals in smokeless tobacco, including Grizzly dipping tobacco, Glo heated tobacco, VELO nicotine pouches, and Vuse vapes. In late 2023, BTI announced it would take a massive noncash writedown—which a few months later would become official, at $34.5 billion—on the value of its American cigarette brands. The stock bottomed in late 2024 and has been recovering ever since, including a roughly 10% gain since the February market top. Despite the writedown, BTI’s top and bottom lines have been generally stable if not improving for years. But the company doesn’t expect sustainable growth until at least 2026, when management believes it will get more support from its smokeless portfolio. Fortunately, the company still keeps finding enough change under the couch to improve its dividend, which it has done in 26 of the past 27 years. A 7%-plus yield is stellar. A forward P/E of 9 not so much once we realize that’s at the high end of its multiyear range. Let’s move on to more traditional consumer staples businesses—but not traditional consumer staples names. The sector’s blue chips tend to be overcrowded, which is a recipe for limited yields. Instead, I prefer stocks that live outside of the spotlight but offer good to great levels of income. SpartanNash (SPTN, 4.2% yield) is a company that we’ve previously discussed as a “grocer-plus.” It operates nearly 200 grocery stores in 10 states across numerous brands, including Family Fresh Market, Metcalfe’s Market and Supermercado Nuestra Familia. But its other, larger segment is a wholesale distribution business that services roughly 2,300 independent grocers across the U.S. The company is several years into a turnaround plan that has helped to rejuvenate the top and bottom lines, but the stock’s performance hasn’t matched. As we said back in 2020, “a look at the past 10 years is probably a decent indication of what the next 10 will broadly look like.” SPTN boasts a decent 4%-plus yield that dwarfs most other grocers, it has raised its distribution for 15 consecutive years, and it pays out just less than half its earnings, so the dividend should have more upside. It’s hard to say the same about the stock price. Management did recently express interest in expanding its Hispanic grocery and convenience store presence, but its plans are in their infancy. BGS Foods (BGS, 10.7% yield) is the name behind brands such as Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Ortega and Bear Creek. Its double-digit yield is largely the product of a slumping stock, with shares off by more than 70% over the past few years amid slumping top and bottom lines. Its 10% return since the market top is something of a small miracle considering its continued operational woes. In late February, B&G reported it was booking charges of $320 million related to “intangible trademark assets” on its Green Giant, Victoria, Static Guard and McCann’s brands. BGS also kept its dividend at 19 cents per share, but it’s an open question as to how long B&G can keep it up. The dividend annualizes to 78 cents per share. The pros expect adjusted profits of 68 cents this year and 73 cents in 2026. Something has to give. FEMSA (FMX, 7.0% yield)—the merciful shorthand for Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V.—isn’t a familiar name, but it’s awfully interesting. FEMSA operates a huge chain of small-box retail stores, called Oxxo, in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Brazil. It uses the same brand for auto service stations in Mexico. It also operates drugstores under several names in Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador. And it owns nearly half of Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF), the world’s largest bottler of Coca-Cola (KO) by volume. FEMSA isn’t automatically a great defensive play, then, if our worry is the U.S. economy. We have to keep our eyes on Mexico to determine FMX’s real utility. But there’s a lot to like here. It has a dominant position in Latin America. Top- and bottom-line growth hasn’t been pristine, but it’s better than many other staples names. Estimates are for 26% profit growth this year, then another 12% in 2026. The dividend itself is generous—FEMSA has become increasingly aggressive about returning capital, and it plans on paying four quarterly ordinary dividends as well as four “extraordinary” dividends, coming out to a yield of about 7%. But while FMX has been plenty fruitful, it has also been more volatile than the average staples stock, and it’s also richly priced at 20 times earnings estimates.

Title: Michael Saylor Predicts BlackRock’s IBIT Will Be The World’s Biggest ETF In The Next Decade

Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder Strategy, has predicted that in the next ten years, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which launched in January 2024 alongside 10 other US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, will become the largest ETF in the world. It might be pocket change when considering BlackRock currently boasts trillions of dollars in assets under management, but it hasn’t gone unnoticed that the asset management giant’s Bitcoin ETF stash is closing in on 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. “BlackRock is accumulating. They now hold 2.77% of the entire Bitcoin supply,” Arkham Intelligence wrote to X on Friday, noting the Wall Street behemoth had added a staggering $1.2 billion in BTC this week alone. As of April 26, BlackRock held approximately 582,000 BTC via IBIT, worth around $54 billion. That makes it the 33rd biggest exchange-traded fund by assets under management. In comparison, the largest ETF by market cap, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), boasts a market capitalization of $593.5 billion, more than ten times that of IBIT. However, speaking at the Bitcoin Standard Corporation’s Investor Day, Strategy’s Michael Saylor forecasted that “IBIT will be the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” 🚨NEW: @saylor predicts that @BlackRock’s $IBIT will be “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” pic.twitter.com/cyDDFf47FV Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas concurred with Saylor that IBIT could potentially become the world’s biggest ETF, though he stressed that it would be extraordinary. “It’s possible, especially if IBIT starts taking in more cash than VOO, but that would require inflows well north of $1 billion a day — more likely in the range of $3 to $4 billion daily, to gain ground. In short, some extraordinary things would have to happen, but it’s possible,” Balchunas said. It’s pertinent to note that this is not Saylor’s first insanely optimistic Bitcoin-related prediction. As ZyCrypto reported previously, the tech entrepreneur said he thinks the crypto will rocket to a price of $13 million per coin over a 21-year period. Saylor’s company currently holds 538,200 BTC, worth roughly $51 billion. Bitcoin recently changed hands at $94,969, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up 13.5% over the past 14 days.

Title: Ethereum Whales Sell, But Bitcoin’s Key Investors Are Buying

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On-chain data shows the Ethereum whales have sold the asset recently, while key holders on the Bitcoin network have accumulated instead. As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum whales have participated in selling recently. The “whales” here refer to the ETH entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1.8 million to $18 million. While these bounds don’t cover the largest of holders in the sector, they do still contain some of the key investors. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the combined balance of these Ethereum whales over the over the past ten days or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum whales have seen their supply go through a net decline recently. During this selloff, these investors offloaded more than 63,000 ETH (about $113.5 million) inside a 48-hour window. From the chart, it’s visible that the distribution from this cohort has coincided with ETH’s recovery rally. This could indicate that these large investors have been capitalizing on the profit-taking opportunity. While the key investors of ETH may have taken profits, the same isn’t true for that of BTC. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed in an X post, the trend has been that of accumulation for BTC recently. In the chart, the analytics firm has attached the data related to the supply of the Bitcoin holders carrying between 10 ($946,000) and 10,000 BTC ($946 million). This range is broader than the one for ETH and includes two key investor cohorts: sharks and whales. These investors have collectively added a total of 19,255 BTC to their wallets alongside the price rally. Thus, it would appear that the key holders of the cryptocurrency are supportive of the recovery run. Naturally, this could imply the Bitcoin rally may have more chances of being sustainable than the Ethereum one. That said, things can change quickly in the digital asset sector, so the trend related to the large entities of both might be worth keeping an eye on. Speaking of accumulation, BTC is currently witnessing high inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as Santiment has pointed out in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that the recent ETF inflows are the largest in months. As the analytics firm notes, As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to BTC ETF’s since the week before Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, up more than 12% in the last week.

Keshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav has been writing for many years, first as a hobbyist and later as a freelancer. He has experience working in a variety of niches, even fiction at one point, but the cryptocurrency industry has been the longest he has been attached to. In terms of official educational qualifications, Keshav holds a bachelor’s degree in Physics from one of the premier institutes of India, the University of Delhi (DU). He started the degree with an aim of eventually making a career in Physics, but the onset of COVID led to a shift in plans. The virus meant that the college classes had to be delivered in the online-mode and with it came free time for him to explore other passions. Initially only seeking to make some beer money, Keshav unexpectedly landed clients offering real projects, after which there was no looking back. Writing was something he had always enjoyed and to be able to do it for a living was like a dream come true. Keshav completed his Physics degree in 2022 and has been focusing on his writing career since, but that doesn’t mean his passion for Physics has ended. He eventually plans to re-enter university to obtain a masters degree in the same field, but perhaps only to satiate his own interest rather than for using it as a means to find employment.. Keshav has found blockchain and its concepts fascinating ever since he started going down the rabbit-hole back in 2020. On-chain analysis in particular has been something he likes to research more about, which is why his NewsBTC pieces tend to involve it in some form. Being of the science background, Keshav likes if concepts are clear and consistent, so he generally explains the indicators he talks about in a bit of detail so that the readers can perhaps come out having understood and learnt something new. As for hobbies, Keshav is super into football, anime, and videogames. He enjoys football not only as a watcher, but also as a player. For games, Keshav generally tends towards enjoying singleplayer adventures, with EA FC (formerly FIFA) being the only online game he is active in. Though, perhaps due to being ultra-focused on the game, he is today a semi-pro on the EA FC scene, regularly participating in tournaments and sometimes even taking back prize money. Because of his enthusiasm for anime and games, he also self-learned Japanese along the way to consume some of the untranslated gems out there. The skill didn’t merely remain as just a hobby, either, as he put it to productive use during his exploration for small-time gigs at the start of COVID, fulfilling a couple of Japanese-to-English translation jobs. Keshav is also big into fitness, with agility and acceleration-related workouts making a big part of his program due to the relevance they have in football. On top of that, he also has a more traditional strength based program for the gym, which he does to maintain an overall fitness level of his body.

Title: This Event Could Be the Next Catalyst for Intel's Stock
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/this-event-could-be-the-next-catalyst-for-intel-stock-11722067
Time Published: 2025-04-26T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Shares of Intel (INTC) finished the week on a down note after its latest financial outlook disappointed investors. The stock’s next catalyst might be just a few days away. Lip-Bu Tan, who presided over the chip company’s quarterly results Thursday for the first time as CEO, will on Tuesday give the keynote address at an event associated with Intel’s Foundry business, which makes chips for other companies. Bank of America analysts in a Friday note said the event could be paired with the announcement of partnerships with other big tech firms. Intel has sought to grow the Foundry business; early last year, it spoke of ambitions to be the world’s second-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) by 2030. Its 2024 foundry revenue, however, fell from a year earlier—it came in north of $17 billion, roughly 30% of the company’s total—and its operating loss widened. This year reports have suggested that Intel might look to sell a stake in the Foundry operation to TSMC; that company, however, has denied talks. Investors were tracking the possibility that a spinoff or sale of Foundry might be in the works well before Tan took over. Investors continue to look for signs of dealmaking. Optimism about a range of possibilities, ranging all the way up to a sale of the entire company, has moved the shares in recent months. That could still be the case. But Tan has said cost-cutting is also a priority: On Thursday, while not formally announcing layoff plans reported earlier in the week, he made clear they are coming. Bank of America analysts, who have a neutral rating for Intel's stock and a $23 price target that is a few cents above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, said Intel is “too big to turn around quickly, but optionality [is] still there.” The stock has lost over a third of its value in the past year through Friday's close.

Title: 9 Pieces of Advice for a Retired Doctor
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/retired-doctor-advice/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T06:30:56Z
Full Content:
We occasionally get requests for more posts about doctors who are on the cusp of retirement or already retired, so I thought I would highlight the situation of a doctor who posted on the Bogleheads Forum looking for advice. The relevant material in the post was as follows: “I am a 74-year-old retired, divorced physician with two sons and a partner who lives separately on a similar amount of assets. I currently have $2 million in investments with an advisor charging 0.7%, and I'm afraid to do this on my own. I have two homes, each worth about $1.8 million. The summer home has many expenses but no mortgage and is adored by my children. The winter house has a $360,000 mortgage at 3.1% and I want to keep both houses for now. I choose to give my kids big extras now, so they don't have to wait until I die. One son is in the arts, and I've said I would pay for childcare if he has children. My two sons are getting married, and I would like to give one $100,000 for a home purchase in the next 2-3 years. I had expected to follow the 4% rule but am finding I need 5.5% to cover my expenses. I was in 60% equities before COVID. I sold 90% of my equities in mid-2022 because I could not afford to hold and make it in retirement. Now I'm back in stocks with 20% of my portfolio (all big American companies including LLY, NVDA, Google, Meta, V, MSFt, Cost, ADBE, AMZN, AAPL) with the rest in bonds, including Treasuries, munis, and corporates. I am thinking about switching to Bogle Vanguard index funds—e.g. [a] three- or four-fund plan. But since I am actually retired, will this give me the 5.5% return? I know I will save some on management fees, but what would Bogleheads recommend as I find I need to go into my capital? Are there other recommendations for people actually in retirement, not just saving for retirement? I would need to get a Vanguard personal advisor, but will they send me cash each month? Are they reachable if I need to make a change? Sometimes I feel the Bogle plan is one-size-fits-all, and with this state of the world, I feel I need help financially adjusting to pandemics, wars, and now a good economy which could go bad depending on the state of the world! I don't want to run out of money!” I think there are nine things to learn from this example—some for this doctor and others for those who are not yet at this stage. It does not appear that this doctor is particularly knowledgeable about personal finance or investing, and it doesn't seem she's been doing a particularly good job managing her assets so far. Yet despite doing that AND probably cutting her assets in half in a divorce, this doc still has a net worth of about $5 million. Imagine how much more that could have been when combined with a dose of financial literacy administered early in her career. House poor is when you have a lot of wealth but it is all tied up in your house. In the case of this doctor, there is $3.6 million tied up in her two houses, but the remainder of the assets total up to just $1.64 million ($2 million in investments minus a $360,000 mortgage). Two million dollars is a big portfolio but not when it is being asked to support a lifestyle that includes twice that much in housing. Selling one of those two houses changes the assets-to-housing ratio from $1.64 million/$3.6 million to $3.4 million/$1.8 million. Dramatically different. Robert Kiyosaki might not have gotten everything right, but he sure was right about the house you live in being a consumption item, not an investment. More information here: How to Buy a House the Right Way This doc has lots of financial goals. She wants to pull 5.5% out of her portfolio. She wants to give her son $100,000 and cover childcare. She wants to maintain both houses. She doesn't want to marry her current partner and combine assets and housing. She wants someone else to manage her investments. She doesn't want to run out of money. She could do any one of those things. She could do most of them. But she probably can't quite do all of them. She's going to have to decide what her priorities are. Making mortgage payments in your 70s is a drag. It's a drag on your cash flow. I don't know what the monthly payment on that $360,000 mortgage at 3.1% is, but let's say it was originally a $700,000 30-year mortgage. The principal and interest payments on that would be $36,177 a year. While the return on paying off the mortgage would be 3.1% (or perhaps even less after tax), the cash flow that would be freed up would be more like 10% ($36,177/$360,000 = 10%). That beats the socks off of 5.5%, much less 4%. This “financial advisor” is charging $14,000 a year, and they allowed this investor to sell low and are now encouraging her to buy high. That's terrible stock market behavior. What's the point of an advisor who can't keep their client from doing that? And why hire an advisor at all if you're going to control the investments yourself? What's up with the individual stock picking and performance chasing, too? It's one thing to pay too much for good advice. It's entirely different to pay too much for bad advice—not that there is any price low enough for advice and service like this doc is getting. If this doc had been using index funds for the last 20 years and had, with the assistance of a good advisor, managed to curb bad investor behavior, her nest egg could easily be two or even three times as large. More information here: The Perfect Financial Advisor How Do You Know If You Are Getting Good Advice at a Fair Price? The 4% guideline basically says you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio a year, adjusted upward for inflation each year, and expect it to last at least 30 years with a high degree of confidence. How do you apply that in the life of a 93-year-old client? You don't. It doesn't apply. That 93-year-old is not going to live 30 more years. They probably won't live five more years. Let's go back to that Trinity Chart and see what it says about shorter time horizons. Note that the study didn't even bother looking at five- and 10-year periods. The shortest period on the chart is 15 years. There's nothing useful here for 93-year-olds. But I'm willing to go way out on a limb here and say a 10% withdrawal rate is completely reasonable for a 93-year-old. That's probably going to last 8-15 more years, and that's going to be plenty. What about a 74-year-old? What's the life expectancy of a 74-year-old female? It's 13 years. It's not bonkers to use the 15-year line in the Trinity study. You can be conservative and use the 20-year line or be ultra-conservative and use the 25-year line. If she has a 50/50 portfolio, she can withdraw 7% a year and expect it to last 15 years 84% of the time. Bump it down to 6%, and it's surely going to make it. So, 5.5% isn't going to be a problem. Even if she lives 25 years, 6% would work 70% of the time (and 5% would work 87% of the time), and it isn't like she can't adjust as she goes (i.e., sell one or even both of the houses). I'm not sure where the old maxim “Never spend your capital” came from, but I suspect it was from a bunch of immortal vampires or something. The rest of us are going to die at some point, and may we all be lucky enough to be heirs of someone who thought they weren't supposed to spend their capital. If you have a $2 million portfolio and never spend your capital, you're going to leave at least $2 million behind that you could have spent yourself or given away to charity with warm hands. Probably more like $4 million. Plan to spend some of your capital in a reasonable way during retirement. It's OK; you won't live forever. This investor feels like she needs an individualized portfolio—a portfolio that can be adjusted for pandemics and wars and good economies—and an advisor that can be reachable in the event she needs to make a change. None of that is likely true. The honest truth about asset management is that we could all probably be dumped into the Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund (VSMGX) (or maybe the Conservative Growth Fund if we're 74) and be just fine. Seriously. Something reasonable, anything reasonable, is going to work when combined with adequate funding and a reasonable withdrawal rate. Thinking we need something special probably just costs us more in advisory fees and hassle. More information here: Retirement Spending Is Ridiculously Tax Advantaged A Framework for Thinking About Retirement Income A big fear for this doc is running out of money. She won't ever actually run out of money because of Social Security. But she doesn't have to set the floor on her spending that low. She can raise it with a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA). A SPIA purchased by a 74-year-old female pays 9.2%. Let's say she's getting $40,000 a year in Social Security. She can take $500,000 of that nest egg, buy a SPIA with it, and raise that floor from $40,000 to $86,000. No, that SPIA isn't adjusted for inflation like Social Security (that's why delaying Social Security to 70 is the best SPIA you can buy), but she's also 74. There aren't that many more years ahead of her for inflation to rear its ugly head. Using some of the nest egg to pay off the mortgage and some of the nest egg to buy a SPIA dramatically improves her cash flow, especially when she realizes she can easily take 6%-7% of the rest each year and spend it without much fear. The decumulation phase can certainly be more complicated than the accumulation phase, but this stuff isn't rocket science, much less nephrology. You can figure it out, and even if you need a little help, you can find someone who can provide that help at a fair price. What do you think? What takeaways do you have from this real-life example? What advice would you give this doc? This doc’s scenario is a textbook case for using a risk-based guardrails (RBG) withdrawal strategy. X% rules are ham-fisted at best – rough approximations of how much money one might need in the kitty to retire with, but terrible for using as a withdrawal strategy. And if she’s doing it that way, why in the heck is she paying an investment advisor 0.7%?? Any variable-percentage withdrawal (VPW) strategy would be better for her. An RBG strategy would be even better, providing her with a maximum spending level based on her current portfolio’s actual value coupled with an adjustment trigger – up or down – based on when her portfolio value hits an upper or lower guardrail. If she could find an advisor who uses that approach it might be worth paying for rather than a ‘roll your own’ BH simple portfolio approach. As for your other suggestions, I can’t add anything else. I especially love the “you can have anything you want; just not everything you want” observation. Yes, spend it down – portfolio and all. Yes, investigate a SPIA (maybe wait until 80, though?). Yes, get out of individual stocks and into index trackers (hopefully without taking too big of a LTCG tax hit). Until I was confident that my finances were secure, I wouldn’t 1) give $100K for a house down payment or 2) agree to pay for childcare. Also, I think she should consider selling one of the houses. I am only 62 and probably have as much with my spouse as she and her ex had before their divorce if it was in the past decade. I was unable to convince myself to give with warm hands until my mother-in-law died leaving money she should have spent on herself or given to her grandkids. Now I am willing and able to distribute to our kids good portions of what she left my husband and let him trade in his old boat for a new one so long as he names it after her. Likely we could have afforded to do it without the inheritance but since we had not counted on it I am pushing myself to technically remove it from our retirement plan. However I also find myself more willing to go out to eat or tip well now that our coffers are a little fatter. Interesting that “afraid to do this on my own” is coupled with several outsized wants. She appears to be alone notwithstanding an advisor whose services has produced this inquiry and should be fired on the spot. It isn’t clear whether the investments are in an IRA or similar retirement account or a regular taxable brokerage account. I suggest starting with some accounting help with budgeting to get on a sound financial footing with no debt and appropriate liquid cash equivalents. Also possibly counseling as I read this. The investment part will then take care of itself. Not sure if WCICON replays would help, the Bogleheads University videos might, and reading The White Coat Investor and The Little Book of Common Sense Investing are musts. Dr Dahle, I think you did a great job analyzing this Doctor’s question and situation, so I don’t have much to add. Regarding the advisor, if she overrode the Advisor’s advice and made the decisions to sell out of equities initially, then I would give a bit of a pass to the advisor. It’s not clear from her statements whether that is the case but I do recognize it as a possibility. My other thought is that maybe she should watch a bit less news and thereby not worry so much about economic calamity. Love your work. Thanks. It’s also interesting that this post was written long before the election, much less the market events of April 2025. I agree about the advisor. She really needs someone to guide her better. Or at least align her goals closer to reality. I would personally be uncomfortable with her overall plans. Regarding the houses, it is a pure luxury in this day and age to have a second house. Especially if unused half the year or more. I don’t know what a proper calculation would be, but I wouldn’t want a second home unless I were worth twice what she has. Maybe not even then. I would consider turning one into a rental and if the kids love it enough they can rent it a few weeks out of the year. Otherwise if it were me, I would sell it. If not, I would personally downgrade the other priorities. Childcare alone in the California Bay area can hit 30k a year. Per child. Red flags abound in this situation. Age 74 and $360,000 mortgage don’t belong in the same sentence. Unless you can enjoy this place for just a couple more years of snowbirding and then sell it for more than what you paid for it, it would be wise to consider selling it now. I think renting a winter place for 2 to 3 months out of the year would still save you a lot of money. And if you gift your son $100,000 to help pay for a home, remember that you will be withdrawing more than that because you will have to cover your taxes from that large withdrawal (unless it’s from a Roth). And taking out that much money at once will likely move you into a higher tax bracket. It’s noble of you to want to help your adult children but you may need to reevaluate the size of your gifts to ensure that you stay financially solvent. We always hear to pay yourself first when saving money while we are working. You need to pay yourself first when in retirement as well! Interesting read. Why is it that the withdrawal portfolios often are a mix of only stocks and bonds? Seems other assets mixed in there can give a higher withdrawal when back tested. I think you should get Frank Vasquez from risk parity radio on the show. The Trinity study only included two asset classes (stocks and bonds) likely for simplicity. The concept of the study is excellent that there are sequence of returns risk and therefore you can’t take out say 8% per year even if your overall average return is 8%. However the 4% number is conservative over a 30 year drawdown. Hopefully you’re right. I’ve included real estate in my portfolio hoping for some of those benefits.

Title: Improved Ireland side can get a much-needed shot of self-belief in Edinburgh

This could be construed as something of a dead rubber. There is certainly not as much on the line as has been the case in recent last-day Six Nations meetings, most notably a year ago when Ireland’s taut 15-12 triumph over Scotland in Belfast secured third place and as a result automatic qualification for both the World Cup and WXV 1. There would be a world of difference in securing third place with a commanding third win out of five games 12 months on and rubber-stamping the huge strides taken by this Irish team in the last year. Finishing third a year ago was a welcome upgrade on losing all five matches and earning the wooden spoon in 2023, but for starters it was achieved with two wins out of five and was indebted to Italy beating Wales on the final day in Cardiff. There will be no good fortune or favours required to finish third this year if Ireland secure a third win out of three away games in this year’s Six Nations. What’s more, were Ireland to win as convincingly as they did against Italy in Parma in round two, especially, and Wales in Newport last Sunday, it would emphatically endorse their standing as “the best of the rest” and the biggest challengers to the upper strata of England and France. In truth, Ireland need to be more clinical than they were against Wales when leaving at least two or three tries behind through handing errors. This is no more than they would have said among themselves and it was reflected in the palpably anticlimactic reaction immediately afterwards of Scott Bemand, who previously worked with an English side that is nearly always ruthlessly clinical in such circumstances. Although the defeats to France and England hurt, the disappointment was relative, not least as Ireland were significantly more competitive in both fixtures than they had been in the corresponding fixtures in recent years. In its way, last week’s lack of satisfaction despite posting more than 40 points away from home was the first bump in the road in this Six Nations and is also a reflection of the huge progress this team has made in the last year and a half. Ireland are making serious progress but nowhere is this belief more important than among the players and staff themselves. There will be a long four months to stew on this Six Nations before Ireland play their World Cup warm-up games in August, and how they sign off in Edinburgh will go some way toward determining how they view this Six Nations and how real the advances have been. Even a laboured performance and win could serve to undermine the team’s self-belief and call into question the strides taken up to now on an almost game-by-game basis through the wins over Australia, New Zealand and the USA and in this championship. [ UL Bohemian duo Aoife Corey and Jane Clohessy in line for first Ireland caps against ScotlandOpens in new window ] By contrast, were Ireland to be more clinical in the Scottish 22 than they were a week ago and thus complete a convincing, statement win against opponents who have caused them issues and even some pain in recent years, it would fuel the team’s self-belief over the ensuing months and into the World Cup build-up. With the World Cup in mind, a six-day turnaround is always an issue and, coupled with injuries, is beginning to highlight Ireland’s lack of real depth were Bemand and co required to dig much deeper, but this is still a good side. The loss of the hugely influential Erin King for this Six Nations and the World Cup is a cruel blow, not least for the player herself. Even so, Ireland can still field a fairly complete backrow in Dorothy Wall, Edel McMahon and Brittany Hogan. There’s also enough quality on a bench featuring Cliodhna Moloney, a second potential debutant in Jane Clohessy, daughter of Peter, Emily Lane, Eve Higgins and Stacey Flood, who will feel she has a point to prove; it looks well equipped to add impact and see the team through. Ireland exorcised a few demons in Parma and need to do so again having lost here by 36-10 two years ago. Scotland will be fired up after their results to date. But Ireland have won 15 of their last 17 Six Nations matches against Scotland and reasserting that authority with a third win in the championship for the first time since 2020 would seal the most positive season in years. SCOTLAND: Chloe Rollie (Trailfinders Women); Rhona Lloyd (Les Lionnes du Stade Bordelais), Emma Orr (Bristol Bears), Lisa Thomson (Trailfinders Women), Francesca McGhie (Leicester Tigers); Helen Nelson (Loughborough Lightning, capt), Leia Brebner-Holden (Loughborough Lightning); Leah Bartlett (Leicester Tigers), Lana Skeldon (Bristol Bears), Elliann Clarke (Bristol Bears); Jade Konkel (Harlequins), Sarah Bonar (Harlequins); Rachel Malcolm (unattached) Rachel McLachlan (Montpellier), Evie Gallagher (Bristol Bears). Replacements: Elis Martin (Loughborough Lightning), Anne Young (Loughborough Lightning), Molly Poolman (Edinburgh Rugby/Watsonian FC) Becky Boyd (Loughborough Lightning), Gemma Bell (Gloucester Hartpury/Hartpury University), Rhea Clarke (Edinburgh Rugby/University of Edinburgh), Evie Wills (Leicester Tigers), Lucia Scott (Gloucester-Hartpury/Hartpury University) IRELAND: Aoife Corey (UL Bohemian/Munster); Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht, capt), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster). Replacements: Cliodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs), Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke/Ulster), Christy Haney (Blackrock College/Leinster), Jane Clohessy (UL Bohemian/Munster), Claire Boles (Railway Union/Ulster), Emily Lane (Blackrock College), Eve Higgins (Railway Union), Stacey Flood (Railway Union). Referee: Natarsha Ganley (NZ). Forecast: Ireland to win.

Title: How To Price Bitcoin? BlackRock Exec Explains
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/how-to-price-bitcoin-blackrock-exec/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T04:00:41Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin should be valued as “an uncorrelated asset that benefits when the world gets messier,” BlackRock’s US Head of Equity ETFs Jay Jacobs told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “Crypto over the long run is decoupled from US tech stocks,” Jacobs said, stressing that short-term market stress can mask the difference but that “the long-term correlation between US stocks and Bitcoin is more like two or three percent.” He argued that what pushes equities higher—“higher growth, higher certainty, lower geopolitical risk”—is the mirror image of the forces that move Bitcoin. “Bitcoin thrives when you have more uncertainty and are looking for something that’s going to behave differently, so fundamentally they should behave like an uncorrelated asset.” BTC was changing hands just under $94,000 during Jacobs’ appearance, extending a rally that has added roughly 150% since spot-ETF approvals early last year. Jacobs tied price behaviour directly to flows. “We would think over the long term, if this trajectory of greater uncertainty around the world continues, things like gold and Bitcoin should continue to go up.” He noted that investors are repositioning accordingly: “We’ve seen significant inflows into gold ETFs; we’ve seen significant inflows into Bitcoin, and this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently.” The biggest beneficiary has been BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which on 23 April absorbed $643 million of net creations—its largest one-day haul since January—lifting the fund’s assets to roughly $54 billion. Jacobs framed the rush into hard assets as part of a longer geopolitical realignment. “If you look at central banks around the world, a continued movement towards diversification beyond just holding dollars is something that’s been happening for decades… the switch from just holding dollars to holding gold to looking at other types of assets like Bitcoin is a trend that’s been years in the making.” Central-bank gold purchases illustrate the shift: net buying topped 1,044 tonnes in 2024, the third consecutive year above the thousand-tonne mark, double the average of the previous decade. He linked those reserve moves to BlackRock’s 2023 “mega-forces” framework, which identified geopolitical fragmentation as a secular driver of returns. “That mega force is materialising in policies like reshoring in the United States and, I think, directly related to that fragmentation has been the rise of things like Bitcoin, as people see more destabilisation in geopolitics resulting in the need for more alternative assets.” BlackRock’s influence is difficult to overstate: the firm ended the first quarter with a record $11.6 trillion under management. By pairing that scale with a public thesis that Bitcoin’s fair price rises as uncertainty deepens, the asset-manager is effectively codifying a valuation model in which scarcity and sanction-resistance—not discounted cash flows—set the marginal price. As Jacobs put it, the market is “looking for alternatives—parts of the portfolio that are going to behave separately from stocks and bonds.” With IBIT now swallowing more BTC each day than miners can produce post-halving, his remarks may offer the clearest blueprint yet for how the world’s largest asset manager thinks about pricing the world’s largest cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC traded at $94,510. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it. Through his extensive work with NewsBTC.com and Bitcoinist.com, Jake has become a trusted voice in the crypto community, guiding newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts alike towards a deeper understanding of this dynamic field.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

26 April 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The compiled reports reflect a broad spectrum of Nepal’s economic and governance dynamics, highlighting issues of regulatory enforcement, infrastructure development, and investment patterns. While NEPSE saw a minor rebound after days of decline, gold prices fell by NPR 1,000 per tola, and consumers continue to bear inflated petroleum costs despite a global price slump—benefiting Nepal Oil Corporation’s profit margins. Regulatory tightening was evident with Nepal Rastra Bank penalizing financial institutions and the Insurance Authority revising foreign employment fund rules. Simultaneously, Facebook faces a registration ultimatum, while Durga Prasai’s multi-billion-rupee loan default case underscores growing scrutiny of corporate misconduct. On the legislative front, the government introduced a bill restricting Everest climbs without prior experience and restructured taxi service standards. Meanwhile, infrastructure remains a mixed picture—rapid bridge construction in Saptari contrasts with chronic delays in Achham and Bajura. In trade and investment, local goods from Humla found markets in China, and Koshi Province reached out to Indian investors. Similarly, the NRNA Australia pledged investment interest, pending a friendlier climate. Despite having sufficient domestic production, the government controversially approved areca nut imports, raising questions about policy priorities. Other highlights include Sun Nepal Life’s rights share issuance, a capped agriculture budget amid high provincial demands, and calls to upgrade critical road segments affecting tourism. Despite global political shifts, MCC aid to Nepal remains intact, reinforcing continued strategic ties with the U.S. Nepse sees minor uptick after consecutive losses The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a slight rise of 2.08 points (0.07%) on the final trading day of the week, closing at 2,658.02. After four days of steady decline, Thursday saw a mild recovery driven by increased investor activity. Out of the traded companies, shares of 83 firms rose, 161 declined, and one remained unchanged. While most sector indices dropped, the trade index climbed by 17.72 points, hydropower rose by 7.73 points, and investment increased by 2.81 points. Gold prices dropped to NPR 189,600 per tola on Friday, down from NPR 190,600 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver prices held steady at NPR 2,000 per tola. On the global market, gold was trading at approximately USD 3,325 per ounce. Despite a 23.53% decline in international crude oil prices since the start of this fiscal year, the Nepal Oil Corporation has passed on minimal price reductions to consumers while posting profits of NPR 9 billion. Petrol prices have dropped by only 6.43%, while diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel were reduced by 8.75%. The price of cooking gas has remained unchanged. MCC assistance to Nepal unaffected by U.S. political shifts Despite the re-election of Donald Trump and changes in U.S. foreign policy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will continue its support to Nepal. According to Reuters, the Trump administration, under close ally Elon Musk, has ordered the suspension of MCC programs in most countries, except for Nepal and three others. Trump has questioned the effectiveness of such aid programs, arguing against the misuse of American taxpayer funds. Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has issued a one-week ultimatum to Meta (Facebook’s parent company) to register in Nepal. Speaking at a program organized by the National Information Commission, he warned that failure to register would result in a ban. The minister emphasized that Meta earns substantial revenue from Nepal and must comply with tax and regulatory obligations, stating that no foreign corporation can be allowed to bypass national laws. Since the Mothihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline came into operation six years ago, over 57 million kiloliters (5.71 billion liters) of diesel have been imported into Nepal. The Madhesh Regional Office of Nepal Oil Corporation reports that between 1,353 to 3,568 kiloliters are imported daily. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the import volume reached 851,338 kiloliters, with daily imports averaging 2,840 kiloliters in the last fiscal year. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken disciplinary action against five financial institutions for breaching banking norms. These include three development banks—Mukti Nath, Narayani, and Salpa—and two finance companies—Janaki and Pokhara Finance. Among the violations, Mukti Nath’s chairman Bharat Raj Dhakal was found involved in unauthorized construction activities, leading NRB to issue an official warning. For the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Agriculture has capped the budget for new agricultural projects at NPR 1 billion across provincial and local levels. However, proposals from these governments have already exceeded NPR 30 billion. Minister Ramnath Adhikari stated that this ceiling includes funding for rural roads, markets, livestock programs, organic fertilizers, and crop improvement. The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) of Australia has expressed its intention to increase investments in Nepal. In a meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NRNA Australia president Anil Pokhrel emphasized the desire of the Australian NRN community to invest more, provided Nepal ensures an investor-friendly environment. Discussions also included strengthening trade and economic ties, leveraging the investment framework, and enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Nepal Insurance Authority has made a second amendment to the regulations governing the Foreign Employment Group Insurance Fund (PUL). Under the new rule, insurance companies must deposit premium records from the 1st to 15th of each month into the designated bank account by the 1st of the following month. Similar requirements apply to the second half of the month. Insurance companies must also submit details of claims and premium receipts to the fund manager, who must confirm the transactions. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has introduced new national standards for taxi services under the “National Standards for Vehicles Used as Taxis 2081,” replacing those of 2076. The updated classification divides taxis into three categories—Ordinary, Deluxe, and Luxury—based on features like size, performance, and amenities. These rules apply to all taxis, including existing and newly registered ones. A proposed provision in the new Tourism Bill 2081 bars individuals from attempting Mount Everest unless they have previously summited a 7,000-meter Himalayan peak. The bill, registered in the National Assembly by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, also requires climbers to submit health certificates. Those deemed medically unfit will be barred from mountaineering or joining climbing teams. This bill will replace the Tourism Act of 2035 B.S. At the Nepal-India Partnership Summit held in Purnia, Bihar, the Koshi Province Committee of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) encouraged Indian investors to consider projects in the province. Committee president Mukesh Upadhyay highlighted investment potential in tourism, agriculture, and other sectors. The event was held in collaboration with organizations like the Sub-Himalayan Research Institute and the Nepal-India Centre. Sun Nepal Life Insurance Company is set to issue 27% rights shares, totaling 10,696,320 shares at NPR 100 per share. The total value of the issue is NPR 1.07 billion. Shareholders recorded by Baishakh 4 are eligible to apply during the open window from Baishakh 30 to Jestha 19. Nepal SBI Merchant Banking is managing the rights issuance. The Gandaki chapter of the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) has urged the government to expedite improvements along the Narayanghat-Butwal section of the East-West Highway. Chairman Hariprasad Sharma Gaire stated that delays in upgrading the road have caused significant hardship for both tourists and locals, with ongoing dust and mud making travel unpleasant. The government has permitted the import of over 11,000 tons of areca nut for the next six months, even though local production—estimated at 14,500 tons annually—is sufficient. Critics argue that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies yielded to pressure from interest groups, especially after scrapping the import quota system last month. Six bridges have been completed in Saptari within the first nine months of the current fiscal year, and seven others are nearing completion, according to the Lahan Road Division Office. Chief Ashutosh Karna said that while load testing remains pending, these efforts aim to expand road infrastructure in the district. Notable projects include bridges on the Ghode Daha River and along the Rajbiraj-Chhinnamasta road. Despite allocating NPR 3.57 billion for 13 road projects in Achham and Bajura, delays persist across 14 out of 19 contracts awarded by the Infrastructure Development Office. Among these, two are designated as provincial pride projects. So far, NPR 1.89 billion has been spent, with NPR 573 million allocated for the current year. Deadline extensions have not resolved construction delays. Local producers in Humla have successfully exported traditional food products to Taklakot, China, under a cross-border trade agreement. Mukunda Rokaya, an entrepreneur from Simkot Municipality-6, reported that the initial shipment—featuring millet and buckwheat flour, walnut oil, and more—generated NPR 1.8 million in revenue. Controversial businessman and healthcare entrepreneur Durga Prasai is being investigated for loan defaults totaling over NPR 7 billion, related to three of his projects. Previously known for leading anti-loan repayment protests, Prasai now faces allegations of threatening bank officials, including a former NRB governor. He has been taken into police custody as investigations continue.

Mumbai: Investor confidence in Adani group companies appears to have climbed significantly following a generally favourable verdict from India’s Supreme Court on the Hindenburg matter, and the subsequent closure of Hindenburg’s operations. During the fiscal year ended 31 March, Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, Indian mutual funds (MFs), and domestic retail investors together injected approximately $3.7 billion or ₹32,571 crore into the group’s 10 listed companies, an analysis by Mint of data from BSE showed. To be sure, during the same fiscal, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth ₹33,945 crore across Adani group firms, except in Adani Energy Solutions, AWL Agri Business and Adani Total Gas Ltd. In January 2023, US-based Hindenburg Research made a host of scathing allegations in a report against Adani group and its dealings while tagging the group for pulling the “biggest con in corporate history". However, following an apex court-monitored probe by market regulator Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) last year, the Supreme Court gave a largely favourable verdict for Adani group in January 2024. Subsequently, Hindenburg’s announcement of closure of its operations in January 2025 led to the rush by domestic investors to buy shares of Adani group companies, the analysis by Mint suggests. Also read | Adani Ports’ latest deal raises growth concerns—markets aren’t impressed Some other factors might have also helped in the resurgence of domestic investment in the group’s companies, according to experts. “Hindenburg shutdown, correction in valuation and, potentially, the progress in execution of Adani's key projects in power and infrastructure have played a major role in attracting investors," the head of equity capital markets at a large global financial services firm said on condition of anonymity. Several Adani companies saw their stocks lose between 12% and 50% in market value after an allegation by the US Department of Justice or DoJ of a New York district court in November 2024. The DoJ had alleged that Gautam Adani and a few other promoter family members and group officials had bribed Indian government officials $250 million to secure solar energy contracts and that it had not disclosed this to investors while raising money from American and international investors. Adani Group had refuted these allegations. Who bought how muchDuring the fiscal, LIC bought shares cumulatively worth around ₹3,575 crore across Adani Enterprises Ltd, Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ), Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and some others. Domestic MFs purchased shares worth at least ₹20,226 crore in almost all Adani group companies except in ACC Ltd and NDTV Ltd. GQG Partners, which indulged in a buying spree of Adani company shares after the Hindenburg attack in 2023, also resumed its purchases. In FY25, it increased its holding cumulatively by about 10% in Adani Enterprises, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Green Energy Ltd (which was named in bribery allegations by the US Department of Justice or DoJ) and Adani Ports, worth at least ₹2,467 crore. Read this | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds Domestic retail investors together bought shares worth ₹6,303 crore in Adani group companies, increasing the most in Adani Green during the fiscal. In absolute terms, across all classes of investors, the most shares were bought of Adani's holding firm (Adani Enterprises), Ambuja Cements, and the group's ports (APSEZ) and power transmission (Adani Energy Solutions Ltd) businesses during the fiscal. Adani Group controls most of the major airports in India along with a large infrastructure portfolio managed through eight listed group companies. Breaking it downMFs increased their holding the most (in terms of value) in Adani Ports ( ₹5,464.92 crore) and Ambuja Cements ( ₹3,453.6 crore) during the financial year, which saw several acquisitions by the group in the ports and cement space. LIC and GQG, on the other hand, purchased the most in the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises, while retail investors bought the most in Adani Green Energy Ltd. Also read | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever All four classes of investors put together purchased at least 51.91 million shares in Adani Energy Solutions, 50.84 million shares in Adani Ports, 19.19 million shares in Adani Enterprises and 39.7 million shares in Adani Green during fiscal 2025, according to the Mint study. Together, these investors bought shares worth ₹6,003 crore in Adani Green and ₹6,721 crore in Adani Ports alone. Earnings made a differenceAccording to a veteran market analyst who requested anonymity, MFs may have started seeing more value in Adani group stocks due to their earnings growth despite external events such as the allegations by DoJ in the US. He said in Adani's holding firm, the growth may have come from two incubation businesses—solar energy equipment manufacturing (under Adani New Industries Ltd or ANIL) and airports (under Adani Airport Holdings Ltd). “While ANIL's operating income was up 121% in the April-December period of FY25, the airports business operating profit went up 42% in the first nine months of FY25. The upcoming 500ktpa copper smelter will also add close to 10-15% to the existing operating income of Adani Enterprises," said the analyst. He said in the case of Adani Ports, the company's operating income grew by 19% for the April-December period, while the company increased guidance to ₹18,000 crore for FY25 after commencing operations at Vizhinjam, Kerala—India’s first trans-shipment port. Recently, the company commissioned a major ship terminal in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

The group's cement capacity increased from 78.9 mtpa last year to over 100 mtpa now. The capacity of Adani Green, which saw maximum investment from retail investors, grew 30% in FY25—14.2 GW from 11 GW, but the stock fell steeply after DoJ’s allegations. “Typically, the advantage of such businesses is that it can provide consistent cashflow, which by leveraging can be re-invested in similar projects. Also, the correction in stock prices of the group firms due to the DoJ allegations may have provided a good entry point for all investors," said the analyst. During fiscal 2025, prices of most Adani group firms corrected significantly on the bourses, with Adani Green stock falling by 48.25%, Adani Total Gas Ltd by 35%, Ambuja Cements by 12% and Adani Enterprises by 27.3%. Adani Energy Solutions, whose order book tripled since 31 March 2024 to ₹57,561 crore, saw its stock falling by 15% in fiscal 2025. And Adani Power, which fell by about 5% in fiscal 2025, has guided doubling its capacity to 30 GW (from 15.25 GW in FY24) by FY30.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $442M on April 24 as IBIT leads – Institutional demand fuels BTC rally

Could this underdog ETF soon rival Wall Street’s biggest giants? Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are regaining momentum as the broader crypto market rebounds. According to data from Farside Investors, spot BTC ETFs witnessed a significant inflow of $442 million on the 24th of April alone. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounting for a massive $327.3 million of that total. This marks a consistent streak of inflows since the 17th of April, signaling renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Riding this wave of optimism, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has made a bold forecast, predicting that IBIT could outpace every other ETF to become the world’s largest within a decade. While such a claim might sound ambitious in a market still dominated by S&P 500 titans, it’s emblematic of Saylor’s long-standing conviction in Bitcoin’s ascent. Echoing similar sentiments, ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted, Source: Nate Geraci/X While BlackRock’s IBIT is still far from matching the scale of ETF giants like Vanguard’s VOO, which boasts over $573 billion in assets, its rapid ascent is hard to ignore. SPY and IVV remain comfortably above the $500 billion mark, but IBIT is gaining traction fast, with BlackRock now holding more than 582,000 BTC, valued at over $54.2 billion. This positions it just outside the top 35 ETFs by AUM, yet it’s already generating daily trading volumes exceeding 45 million shares. In a space where Bitcoin was once barely acknowledged by institutions, this surge signals a transformative shift. Adding to the momentum, U.S. spot BTC ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of 11,898 BTC in a single day, the highest since the 11th of November 2024. While Saylor’s bold predictions of Bitcoin reaching $13 million per coin may seem far-fetched, his history of early, unwavering conviction gives such statements unusual weight. After a period of muted flows, the recent spike in institutional Bitcoin activity signals a decisive shift in sentiment. Daily inflows that once averaged just 23 BTC in 2025 have now surged dramatically, reflecting renewed confidence from large-scale investors. This revival is vividly illustrated by Glassnode’s charts, where bold green bars have replaced the prior red streak, marking a clear break from the stagnation. The resulting uptick in demand has fueled Bitcoin’s price momentum, with BTC climbing to $93,734.12, up 10.86% over the past week. Such data underscores a strong institutional return, likely laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next major leg upward.

Title: Special Report: We Are Being Warned That There Will Be Empty Shelves Throughout The U.S. “Starting In A Couple Of Weeks”

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Experts are telling us that the supply chain disruptions that we are facing are likely to be more severe than anything that we witnessed during the last pandemic. Anyone that believes that we can easily replace 438 billion dollars of imports from China is just being delusional. There are thousands of products that are made in China that are simply not made anywhere else. Yes, we will do what we can to mitigate the damage, but there is only so much that we can do. I just heard from one business owner that has already received numerous price increase notifications from his suppliers. And apparently there are already hundreds of products on Amazon that have had their prices raised substantially… Amazon merchants are hiking prices for everything from diaper bags and refrigerator magnets to charm necklaces and other top-selling items as they confront higher import costs. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29% in categories, including clothing, jewelry, household items, office supplies, electronics and toys. In many other cases, products that are manufactured in China will no longer be coming to the United States at all. In fact, President Trump is even admitting that most Chinese businesses “won’t do any business here” as long as tariff rates remain this high… Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently that no one thinks the current status quo with China is sustainable. The president was asked by Time if he agrees with that sentiment. “Oh I agree,” Mr. Trump responded. He said China “won’t do any business here, because at 145%, it’s going to be very rare that you see business.” Nobody can deny that President Trump is quite correct about this, and the numbers that we are already seeing are quite staggering. For example, it is being reported that the “volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%”… US businesses began scaling back or canceling orders as President Trump ratcheted up the trade war with Beijing after returning to the White House. The volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%, compared to the same period last year, according to container-tracking software provider Vizion. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Container bookings for shipments from China to the United States dropped by a staggering 64 percent during the first week of April compared to the previous week… The drop in predicted arrivals at Los Angeles follows reports from data provider Vizion of a “crash” in container bookings in April. For shipments from China to the US, bookings fell 64pc in the first week of the month compared to the previous week. Analysts blamed the crash on importers who were cancelling shipments to “reassess costs, timelines, and broader trade strategy”. This is leaving more container ships half-empty – and prompting more shipping companies to cancel voyages in a bid to reduce losses and stop fees plummeting. Imagine a truck that is speeding along at 70 miles per hour and someone slams the brakes all the way to the floor. That is essentially what we are facing. FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller is warning that trucking activity out of the L.A. area is likely to drop 50 percent and we are likely to see “massive layoffs”… Year-over-year trucking activity out of Los Angeles down 23%. It will likely drop to 50% in the coming weeks if there isn’t trade war resolution. Massive layoffs coming to the West Coast trucking sector The bottom line is that a lot less stuff is going to be coming to our stores. In fact, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council is convinced that “starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff”… Some of the products likeliest to go missing from store shelves in the coming months will be lower-cost footwear, apparel, toys and electronics, for which manufacturing is heavily concentrated in China, Gold said. Other perishable items coming from China, like apple juice and fish, have limited shelf lives and were more difficult for retailers to stockpile. “Like back during Covid where we had shortages of toilet paper, we are going to start seeing that in more and more goods,” said Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “Starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff, and if the administration waits to resolve the problem until we have shortages and hoarding, that is just too late.” His assessment was echoed by an expert that was interviewed by the New York Post… China accounts for about 54% of all US containerized imports from Asia – from electronics, toys, apparel, furniture and building materials. It generally takes two to three weeks to make the journey from China to the West Coast ports. “Things that can’t be inventoried, you’ll see (shortages) in a matter of weeks, maybe not even months,” Rita McGrath, strategic management scholar and professor at Columbia Business School, told The Post. And the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot essentially told President Trump the same thing… Earlier this week, America’s most powerful retail executives trooped into the White House to deliver a blunt prognosis: tariffs on Chinese goods risked causing “empty shelves” in two weeks without a change of course. The three companies who attended the meeting – Walmart, Target and Home Depot – are among the most exposed to the president’s policies, which include tariffs of up to 145pc on Chinese goods and higher port fees for Chinese-made vessels. We are heading into a full-blown nightmare. Even if the U.S. and China were to reach a trade deal tomorrow, and that is definitely not going to happen, it would still take an extended period of time before our supply chains returned to normal… Even if Trump were to reduce the tariffs, the disruption caused to the supply chain could take weeks or months to unravel, given the time it takes for ships to across the Pacific and for the other pieces of the supply chain to snap back into place. “You have an eight-week period where volumes are going to crash before they can even come back up, and that’s if things return to normal,” said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight and Analytics. “All this comes at a time of the year when volumes really should start to increase.” For now, it appears that the Chinese are digging in for the long haul. On Friday, we learned that China’s Politburo has decided to implement a plan to assist those that are being impacted by the trade war… In an economic-analysis meeting on Friday, the 24-man Politburo, China’s main decision-making body headed by President Xi Jinping, said authorities would roll out specific plans to support companies and individuals affected by the trade war. They pledged to “coordinate domestic economic work with international economic and trade engagements, resolutely focus on doing our own affairs, steadfastly expand high-level opening up, and focus on stabilizing employment, businesses, markets, and expectations”, according to a meeting readout released by Xinhua. “By enhancing the certainty of high-quality development, we can effectively respond to the uncertainties brought by drastic changes in the external environment,” it said. Here in the United States, those that are getting hammered by the trade war are just going to have to deal with it. This is a really bad time for this to happen. Economic conditions were already starting to slow down, and a major conflict with Iran could erupt at any time. It is often said that when it rains, it pours. It is definitely raining now, and if the U.S. and China cannot reach a deal soon we are going to get absolutely soaked.

RECAP: Asian shares rose yesterday in line with a global relief rally as trade tensions cooled and US Federal Reserve officials indicated they would be open to cutting interest rates earlier than anticipated. The SET index moved in a range of 1,127.46 and 1,161.03 points this week, before closing yesterday at 1,159.00, up 0.7% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 34.94 billion baht. NEWSMAKERS: US President Donald Trump has signalled a potential U-turn in his trade war with China amid continued market volatility, saying the high tariffs on Chinese goods will "come down substantially, but it won't be zero". COMING UP: On Monday, France releases employment data. On Tuesday, the US releases consumer confidence and job openings updates, and China reports manufacturing PMI. On Wednesday, Germany reports first-quarter GDP and updated inflation data; the US releases quarterly GDP and crude oil inventories, and the Bank of Japan announces interest rate decision. STOCKS TO WATCH: InnovestX Securities says that if the Thai policy interest rate is cut next week, it could provide positive sentiment for stocks, in addition to the expected boost when Thai ESGX funds begin trading on May 2.

Recommended stocks are BDMS with a fundamental target price of 32 baht, CPF (30 baht) and BCP (47 baht). TECHNICAL VIEW: InnovestX Securities sees support at 1,120 points and resistance at 1,190.

Title: ‘Forget about glamour’: Jonathan Anderson offers advice to would-be fashion designers
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fashion/2025/04/25/forget-about-glamour-jonathan-anderson-offers-advice-to-would-be-fashion-designers/

Jonathan Anderson, the newly appointed creative director of Dior men’s wear in Paris, made history on Friday when he became the first fashion designer to be made an Honorary Patron of Trinity College Dublin’s University Philosophical Society. At a packed ceremony, the Irish designer was presented with the Gold Medal by the society’s treasurer Perin Winders, who outlined Anderson’s career and achievements. The award is given by the 340-year-old society to individuals who have excelled in their given fields. In this case it acknowledged Anderson’s contribution to the world of fashion as one of the most influential designers of his generation. Previous recipients of this award include film director Martin Scorsese, former US president Joe Biden, actors Al Pacino, Dame Helen Mirren and Whoopi Goldberg, Tim Cook of Apple and most recently comedian Stephen Colbert. Anderson (41), from Magherafelt, Co Derry, who studied in Blackrock College, is the elder son of former Irish rugby captain Willie Anderson and his wife Heather, a teacher. Anderson said it was a huge honour to receive the award in Dublin, where he had come out as gay and where he first fell in love with fashion, “having blagged my way into a job in Brown Thomas”. Dressed casually in a brown leather jacket and jeans, Anderson also described how he had applied to every fashion college he could find “and every single one turned me down, one offer finally coming for a new men’s wear course at the College of Fashion in London” which kick-started his career. “I am a big believer in failure, and those I look up to are people who have failed and kept going,” he said. There is an incredible amount of work. I think you have to be able to get up every morning and learn something new every day and push yourself out there In a free-ranging question and answer session with Winders, issues such as collaboration, his work in film, the changing role of designers, social media and the fashion world in general generated thoughtful responses. “Life and society have become faster and faster because of social media and we are exposed to so much now that everything is becoming a blur and anonymity is the biggest luxury today,” he said. “Fashion’s big questions – how we deal with the planet, with what we make, but we want to fix everything tomorrow. Government and business have to work together and long-term goals are important.” Anderson also spoke about his pride in having set up the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize during his 11-year tenure at the Spanish luxury brand, which he turned into a global superstar now worth nearly $3 billion. The award is an annual one recognising excellence among makers. Asked what advice he would have for young people interested in a fashion career, he was very clear about its demands. “Forget about glamour, there is an incredible amount of work. I think you have to be able to get up every morning and learn something new every day and push yourself out there,” he said. [ Fashion at the Louvre: Spectacular exhibition sees modern masterworks meet art and historyOpens in new window ] “Even as a child I could never sit still and I always try to do a better job every time I get up in the morning. If you are good and believe in yourself, you can go anywhere, but (in fashion) you have to be a bit of a performer and you have to be quite ruthless and fight your way in.” His annual workload has involved 16 collections – eight for his namesake brand and eight for Loewe. His first men’s wear show for Dior will be at the end of June; he is delving into the Dior’s archives and wants to “be able to explore a different language”. “I like a challenge, and I come with more experience to the job,” he said. Anderson concluded his remarks by saying how proud he is to be Irish and highlighting the need for what he called “more crossing of the aisles” in the current debate about unity. “I am so proud of where I grew up. But growing up in the ’90s was shocking in Northern Ireland and I have seen horrifying things. “Today, however, it is like Disneyland with the Titanic Centre and everything else,” he said, to laughter and applause from the audience.

April 25, 2025 13:50 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed Friday, leading shares of several other adtech and AI stocks higher, after showing signs of success with AI features. Alphabet's Class A shares jumped over 4% to just above $166, before paring gains in recent trading. Shares of several other tech companies in digital advertising that use AI tools also gained, including Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and AppLovin (APP). (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) The Google parent reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings Thursday, with CEO Sundar Pichai telling investors Google Search growth was driven by "engagement we're seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" in just under a year since its launch. Several analysts, including those at Citi and Wedbush, boosted their price targets for the stock in the wake of the results, pointing to its AI potential. Bank of America analysts, who also raised their price target, said they believe Wall Street "may be underappreciating" opportunities tied to search features like AI Overviews and AI-driven cloud demand. That trend could suggest more growth for other companies with cloud and digital ad businesses, with several set to report earnings in the coming weeks. Snap is scheduled to report next Tuesday, with Meta and cloud giant Microsoft set to follow Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. AppLovin is scheduled to release results the following Wednesday, May 7, with Pinterest's report due a day later.

Title: Copycat Ozempic makers just lost a big court fight

A federal judge in Texas handed Novo Nordisk (NVO) a big win late Thursday in its battle against cheaper versions of its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, rejecting a bid by compounding pharmacies to keep making the drugs while a legal challenge moves forward. In a sealed order U.S. Judge Mark Pittman denied a request for preliminary injunction a trade group representing compounding pharmacies that would have prevented the Food and Drug Administration from taking action against its members for making knock-off versions using semaglutide, the active ingredient in the weight loss drugs. Small-scale compounders must now immediately stop making their versions of Ozempic and Wegovy. Larger, federally licensed compounders have until May 22 to keep producing the copycats. The popular drugs had been in short supply for some two years, which led the FDA to declare a shortage, thus allowing pharmacists to legally make compounded versions of the patented medications. Many telehealth companies also jumped into the market with compounded drugs. However, in February the FDA determined that the semaglutide shortage was over, leading to the lawsuit by Outsourcing Facilities Association. “We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders’ attempts to undermine FDA’s data-based decision that the shortage of Wegovy® and Ozempic® is resolved,” said Steve Benz, Corporate Vice President, Legal and U.S. General Counsel, Novo Nordisk in an statement. He said that the company will continue driving legal actions forward “and escalate our efforts as necessary, while closely engaging with regulators and law enforcement.” Compounding pharmacies make drugs tailored to individual prescriptions for a specific patient and are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. Eli Lilly (LLY) has also taken aggressive legal action against compounding pharmacies, and on Wednesday filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies that offer cheaper versions of its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.

Karlstad, Sweden | April 25, 2025 ________________________________________ The transformation of our relationship with news resembles the shift from voyaging on a sailing ship to piloting a supersonic jet. In the age of handwritten letters and horse-drawn mail coaches, news travelled like vessels charting ancient sea routes: steadily, predictably, with ample time for fact and rumour to be sifted before docking at the harbour of public consciousness. A letter from distant kin might take months to cross continents, and each word it bore was treasured with patience—information was scarce and therefore sacred. Today, we navigate a “digital Macondo hyperocean,” where, instead of one carefully composed missive, we are submerged in an unending torrent of fragments clamouring for our attention. News no longer passes through traditional verification customs; anyone may cast a message, like a piece of paper, into a bottle—into the cyber sea of Macondo—and millions may retrieve its contents simultaneously. Rather than a single official bulletin, the modern “port authorities”—governments and institutions—issue manifold and often contradictory communiqués. We inhabit a dishonest realm where every statement drifts under suspicion of falsehood. ________________________________________ In those forgotten years when the postal carriers—uniforms as strict as their expressions—imposed order upon the wilderness of streets with their mystic system of numbers, the world possessed a rigidity that made it legible. Even digits divided the righteous from the sinners: evens to the right, odds to the left. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had yet to witness the seventeen artificial roses that would blossom from his blood in the plaza, and the gypsy Melquíades had not yet returned with his parchments of miracles. Now we wander like blind men through a labyrinth of our design, our fingertips raw from brushing against walls that shift by the hour. We yearn for the certainty that once guided letters from lover to beloved across impossible distances, yet the compass needle spins madly, mocking our desperation. The boundary between right and left has dissolved like sugar in the bitter coffee of existence—a minor tragedy beside the greater dissolution that follows. In this perpetual twilight, white no longer stands apart from black, nor light from shadow. The grey mist that descended upon Macondo during those five years of unrelenting rain has settled permanently in our souls. We peer at moral questions through their haze, unable to discern their accurate outline, while ancestral ghosts whisper counsel that fades before we can grasp it. And here lies the most terrible revelation—an heirloom of despair passed down through generations: we have forfeited even the sacred right to choose. Our freedom languishes in the same distant chamber where undeliverable letters are heaped, forgotten in dusty corners where lamps never glimmer. The illusion of choice gleams before us like the golden fish Úrsula once dreamed of, always visible yet forever beyond reach, condemned to circle in waters too deep for our understanding. If we remember when we complained about the postal service, we did so because we did not know what the future would bring; it was impossible to imagine that ZIP codes would impose order on chaos and that envelopes—sealed with a quick lick and a spark of hope—would carry our faith across continents. The postal network, conceived by visionary officials and traced daily by letter carriers who mapped the world with every route, served as an invisible compass: a shared spell through which nations unable to understand one another knew precisely how to be found. Indeed, in every odd-numbered address lay a promise, in every even number, a certainty. ________________________________________ But now, adrift in a present that reeks of stale hand sanitiser and cables severed by tariff wars, we grope blindly through shattered coordinates. Postal routes, once sacred, have been replaced by supply chains that snap like threads of spittle in a dying man’s mouth. The Universal Postal Union, which in glorious times stitched together continents like the points of a single love letter, lies in tatters, replaced by a masquerade in which trade powers recite lies in diplomatic accents. In this deracinated age—a world without fixed coordinates, where addresses dissolve like salt in rain—there are no saviours in postal uniforms, no envelopes bearing redemption. The mailman’s whistle has gone silent, replaced by the hollow reverberation of footsteps that never arrive, never depart. They linger as spectres in the dust, those echoes: false promises of connection, of permanence. Empires crumble on schedule. Tyrants rot. Rebels in overalls, clutching Orwell’s tattered manifesto, rise from furrows only to inherit the same rot they sought to burn. History is not a straight road but a ouroboros, its jaws clamped tight on its tail, spinning the earth into a dizzying gyre of repetition. We exist in the parenthesis between ruin and renaissance, scribbling our names on air, sending letters to a future that rewrites itself endlessly. There is no fixed point, no destination—only the ceaseless orbit, the Sisyphean march, the myth of progress unravelling like a frayed postal route into the void. ________________________________________ Late last week, the Financial Times reported that President Vladimir Putin had “generously” offered to freeze Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at whatever line most suited Moscow. The pitch was whispered to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s self‑styled envoy—during a meet‑and‑greet in St Petersburg. Never mind the optics: who better than a property developer to broker peace between armies? Washington, meanwhile, floated the notion of gifting Crimea to Russia and turning a polite blind eye while four more regions stayed under occupation. Voilà—peace! The proposal was trumpeted as the Kremlin’s first “formal” softening in three years, and some Western headlines applauded Putin’s "restraint" as though brutality measured in half‑steps were magnanimity. Less enchanted, European diplomats warned that the offer was likely bait: a showy concession designed to tether Trump to deeper Russian demands. Still, the story rolled on—amplified by Bloomberg, cross‑stitched by Swedish reporting, and wallpapered across the 24‑hour news feeds. Back home, President Trump’s standing was buckling. A Supreme Court setback and the worst poll numbers of his career formed the backdrop to the St Petersburg overture. Into that vacuum stepped The Mirror, gleefully quoting Trump, labelling Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" during a sour White House clash—footage Russian broadcasters replayed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ________________________________________ In a tableau torn from Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, a handful of nimble traders—moral compasses rattling like Raskolnikov’s heartbeat—scooped up billions on a toy‑company stock that whiplashed with every tariff tweet—sí, te quiero, poquito, nada: tariff on at noon, tariff off by dusk—while the broader energy sector bled nearly $150 billion in market value over the same 48‑hour whiplash—Brent futures slid 7 percent, the XLE energy ETF sank 6.2 percent, ExxonMobil alone vaporised roughly $22 billion in market cap, Chevron $18 billion, and the European duo of BP and Shell a further $25 billion. Clean‑energy names fared no better—ICLN (the global clean‑energy ETF) sank 8 per cent, First Solar erased $4 billion, Enphase another $3 billion, while Vestas and Ørsted together shed roughly €6 billion—altogether about $35 billion in green‑power market cap evaporated. Nor did Big Tech escape the downdraft: the so‑called Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla—collectively shed roughly $350 billion in market value during the same two‑day window (Apple − $80 billion, Microsoft − $70 billion, Nvidia − $60 billion, Amazon − $45 billion, Alphabet − $40 billion, Meta − $30 billion, Tesla − $25 billion). In the market’s brutal zero‑sum arithmetic, one player’s windfall is another’s ruin. This time, the crater opened beneath ordinary pension funds—state teachers’ and firefighters’ plans with heavy XLE exposure surrendered an estimated $9 billion in paper value. When you roll in police, municipal‑worker, and federal Thrift Savings allocations, public‑sector pension systems saw roughly $27 billion vanish inside two trading sessions. ________________________________________ Enter, stage left, the indispensable Mr. Dmitry Peskov—because what self‑respecting Kremlin melodrama would dare proceed without its dapper master of ceremonies? A career diplomat‑turned‑spin‑doctor, he glides through marble corridors brandishing a résumé as glossy as a freshly lacquered nesting doll: fluent in English, Turkish, French, and Arabic (thank you, MGIMO—Russia’s Hogwarts for budding power‑brokers), a formative posting in Ankara, and a society‑page marriage to Olympic ice‑dance diva Tatiana Navka. The man even sports a clipped Oxford accent, as if the Queen herself had coached him between caviar courses. And of course, this week’s Absolutely‑Limited‑Time Offer™—pitched with the grin of a duty‑free perfume hawker and the menace of a Bond villain—features: 🌹 One (1) Romanov‑era Fabergé egg—nothing whispers “trust me” like jewel‑encrusted poultry. 🌹 Lifetime first‑dibs on rare‑earth contracts—corner the battery market while saving the planet (fine print rendered in invisible ink). 🌹 Billions in natural‑gas sweetheart deals—blue flame, red tape, green cash. 🌹 And—crash the cymbals—the shimmering hallucination of a TRUMP KREMLIN TOWER®, stabbing the Moscow skyline and powered exclusively by Gazprom gratitude. The Moscow Times calls this glittering hamper “bait” to reel in Donald Trump; Peskov, ever the courteous angler, insists they are merely “areas of mutual economic opportunity.” Happy birthday, democracy—your cake is Fabergé, the candles burn methane, and the guest of honour just sold the bakery. The pièce de résistance? A February 10 executive order pausing enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for 180 days “in the interests of national security.” Just in time to clear the path for all those mutual opportunities. ________________________________________ In memory of Pope Francis—the man of humility, inclusion, and the migrant—hailed, astonishingly, by both Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian leader of the Russian state, and Donald Trump, the former and current President of the United States, as though concord itself had sprouted wings. Their unlikely agreement in praising the pontiff bridged ideological chasms, creating a rare moment when these two powerful heads of state found common ground in their admiration for a man who consistently advocated for the vulnerable and marginalized.

New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit challenging the Interior Department's decision, arguing it violates federal administrative procedures and established permitting protocols. Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups and labour unions has announced plans for nationwide protests against what they describe as "politically motivated energy policy reversals." Secretary Burgum defended the administration's position in a press conference on Tuesday, stating that all offshore wind projects are under review to ensure "economic viability and energy security." Ørsted announced a strategic review of its U.S. operations in response to the current regulatory climate, potentially delaying additional offshore wind investments. Meanwhile, in Europe, Finland has joined Sweden and Italy in accelerating nuclear power development, announcing plans to extend the operating licenses of its existing reactors and streamline approvals for new small modular reactor technologies. This week, the International Energy Agency released a report indicating that global renewable energy installations continue to grow slower than projected in specific markets due to policy uncertainties, supply chain constraints, and inflationary pressures. Crude oil markets experienced significant volatility this week, with prices rebounding slightly following last week's sharp decline. Brent crude settled at $72.40 per barrel on Thursday, up 3.2% from last week's three-year low, as markets reassessed the impact of China's retaliatory tariffs. On Wednesday, OPEC+ ministers held an emergency virtual meeting to discuss market conditions but maintained their current production strategy. ExxonMobil announced a $12 billion investment in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas development, citing the administration's supportive stance toward domestic fossil fuel production. Similarly, Chevron has reactivated previously paused drilling projects in the Permian Basin. Several automakers are reconsidering their U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing investments following the administration's rollback of federal incentives. Ford announced it will delay the planned expansion of its Tennessee battery plant by at least 18 months. General Motors is reportedly reviewing the timeline for transitioning certain production lines to EVs at its Michigan facilities. BYD broke ground on its first European manufacturing facility in Hungary this week, accelerating its international expansion despite growing trade tensions. The facility will produce battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles primarily for European markets. Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, reversed its technical staff and granted preliminary approval for Petrobras to drill near the Amazon River mouth, sparking protests in Brasília and criticism from environmental organisations. President Lula defended the decision as "necessary for Brazil's energy sovereignty" while promising additional ecological safeguards. India's Power Ministry announced new grid integration measures to accommodate both coal expansion and growing renewable capacity, acknowledging the country's dual strategy will continue through the decade. The announcement came as parts of northern India experienced rolling blackouts amid an early heat wave. Energy sector stocks have shown divergent performance this week, with fossil fuel companies generally gaining while clean energy shares declined. The S&P Global Clean Energy Index fell 3.2% over the week, while the S&P 500 Energy Sector index rose 2.1%. Analysts attribute this pattern to anticipated policy shifts favouring conventional energy sources. Natural gas prices in the U.S. rose to a six-month high following forecasts of warmer-than-average temperatures across much of the country, increasing cooling demand expectations. European gas prices remained stable as storage levels continue to exceed seasonal averages. The markets are closely watching next week's Federal Reserve meeting for signals about interest rate trajectories, which could significantly impact energy investment patterns through the remainder of 2025. 📌 U.S. Climate and Energy Policy Reuters – "NY files legal challenge against Trump administration's Empire Wind halt" (April 23, 2025) Bloomberg – "Burgum defends energy policy amid mounting offshore wind controversy" (April 22, 2025) Politico – "Environmental groups plan nationwide protests over wind project cancellations" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Renewable Energy and Nuclear Power Financial Times – "Ørsted announces strategic review of US operations amid policy uncertainty" (April 21, 2025) World Nuclear News – "Finland accelerates nuclear development plan to meet carbon goals" (April 22, 2025) IEA – "Renewable Energy Market Update – April 2025" (April 20, 2025) 📌 Fossil Fuel Markets and Investment S&P Global – "Oil prices rebound from three-year lows as market reassesses China tariff impact" (April 24, 2025) Reuters – "OPEC+ holds emergency meeting, maintains production strategy" (April 23, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "ExxonMobil announces $12B Gulf of Mexico investment push" (April 23, 2025) Energy Intelligence – "Chevron restarts paused Permian drilling projects" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Electric Vehicle Market Dynamics Automotive News – "Ford delays Tennessee battery plant expansion amid EV incentive uncertainty" (April 22, 2025) Reuters – "GM reviewing EV transition timeline for Michigan facilities" (April 23, 2025) Financial Times – "BYD begins construction on first European manufacturing plant" (April 21, 2025) 📌 Geopolitical Energy Developments Reuters – "Brazil's Ibama approves Amazon drilling despite staff recommendations" (April 22, 2025) Estado de São Paulo – "Environmental protesters gather in Brasília following Amazon drilling decision" (April 23, 2025) Economic Times – "India announces new grid integration measures amid northern blackouts" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Economic and Market Trends Bloomberg – "Clean energy stocks slide as fossil fuels rally on policy expectations" (April 24, 2025) CNBC – "Natural gas prices hit six-month high on warming forecasts" (April 24, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "Energy investors eye Fed meeting for interest rate signals" (April 25, 2025) No discussions yet.

Title: Saylor Predicts BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Will Be The Biggest ETF In 10 Years

Time Published: 2025-04-25T16:30:16Z

At Bitwise’s Bitcoin Standard Corporations Investors Day, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor set an audacious marker for the entire exchange-traded fund landscape, declaring that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker: IBIT) will become “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” The remark instantly rippled through the ETF community, where practitioners are well-aware that the current asset-class hierarchy is dominated by broad-based equity funds rather than single-asset vehicles. IBIT already occupies a rarefied tier within digital-asset finance: according to Bitcoin Treasuries, the trust now custodies more than 575,000 BTC, an estimated $54.3 billion. That asset haul places it as the best-ever ETF launch in history. Skepticism, however, was swift—and data-driven. “Just for some context on this… Largest ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has taken in over $51 bil just this year. IBIT’s total assets = $54 bil. Would be [a] Herculean feat for IBIT,” wrote Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store and host of ETF Prime, in a post on X. Geraci’s framing underscores the magnitude of the gap: VOO’s $51 billion of 2025 net inflows alone nearly matches IBIT’s entire asset base. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas offered a similarly tempered outlook. “I would never say never re IBIT bc it broke every conceivable record its rookie year but… King VOO is curr 10x bigger and hauls in 5x more cash every day = would take a flat or negative decade for US stocks while btc moons,” he posted, pointing to the entrenched scale and relentless cash generation of the Vanguard fund. Balchunas elaborated that for IBIT to close the gap organically it would need “well north of $1 b/day, like $3 b or $4 b/day if it hopes to gain ground,” concluding that “some extraordinary sht would have to… happen but it’s poss.” When asked whether investors might absorb bitcoin’s “perfect savings” narrative more rapidly, Balchunas distilled his answer to “Two words, two syllables: cash flow,” highlighting the gravitational pull that dividend and earnings streams exert on portfolio construction. Saylor’s forecast lands in a market environment already primed by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink’s own headline-grabbing Bitcoin thesis. On 22 January 2025, during a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Fink told Bloomberg that widespread institutional allocation—“2% or even 5%” of portfolios, he said, citing a recent discussion with a sovereign wealth fund—could propel Bitcoin to “$500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Describing the asset as a “currency of fear,” Fink argued that Bitcoin’s borderless design provides a hedge against “the debasement of your currency, or the economic or political stability of your country.” For Saylor, whose corporate-treasury Bitcoin strategy has made Strategy a leveraged proxy on the token’s price, Fink’s framing offers macro-level validation: if sovereign wealth funds follow through on exploratory conversations, demand could eclipse the finite supply captured inside IBIT. The question—posed implicitly by Geraci’s and Balchunas’ numbers—is whether that demand can outpace the relentless inflows into equity index stalwarts during a decade in which global investors remain wedded to cash-generative, regulation-familiar assets.

Title: It Is The Era Of Great Detachment: Time For A New Management Playbook

ByAnjali Chaudhry ByAnjali Chaudhry, Contributor. Isometric group of businessmen carrying piles of documents in cardboard boxes left the office, ... More unemployment, dismissal, career crisis, economic crisis leading to massive layoffs It’s a precarious time to be a manager in today’s workforce. Nearly 200,000 employees have been laid off in just weeks—a number not seen since the 2020 recession—due to sweeping efficiency mandates from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The latest workplace trend, dubbed “What did you do last week?”, pushes productivity into short, tangible bursts, leaving little room for meaningful and substantive work. Layered atop this is an unrelenting news cycle filled with tariff wars, geopolitical instability, and economic headwinds. Unsurprisingly, Glassdoor reports the lowest employee confidence index since tracking began in 2016. Gallup data reinforces the sentiment: employee engagement is at a decade low. Experts now call it the era of Great Detachment. Decades of research show that disengagement leads to lower quality work, reduced safety, and decreased profitability. In this climate, managers are in a double bind, between efficiency mandates and employee expectations. On the one hand, they are the foot soldiers having to implement the strident call for efficiency while being constrained by the lack of support or training. On the other hand, they must manage employee expectations that are stuck in the post-pandemic era. One of the very first executive orders terminated remote work arrangements in the federal government. Many businesses across industries including behemoths such as Amazon, JP Morgan, and AT&T followed suit with their own return to office mandates. Yet, employee preferences tell a different story. Remote work preference has jumped from 8% to 33% since 2019. Meanwhile, only 7% now prefer onsite work—down from 60%. These numbers reflect a major disconnect that managers are forced to reconcile, often without tools or autonomy. To answer the pressing questions—How do I motivate employees? How can I encourage innovation amidst uncertainty?—leaders must start by restoring a sense of agency in their teams. Today’s workforce is teeming with diversity—not just in demographics but in terms of what employees want, need, or even expect. The psychological contract between employer and employee is more idiosyncratic than ever making a ‘one-size fit all’ management style a very bad idea. Rather than making unilateral assumptions about what will work, it is time to engage with the employee one-on-one. Having an open and honest dialogue has always been a hallmark of a good manager. For those wondering how, two promising techniques worth investing in are active listening and appreciative enquiry. Active listening calls for demonstrating empathy and genuine interest and thus creating safe space for employees to share what they need to succeed. Appreciative enquiry is about engaging in dialogues that begin with exploring what is working and then, supporting employee to build on it. Being authentic is the key. A week-to-week accountability model creates pressure to convey busyness and deliver quick wins. Managers need to buck the trend for efficiency demands as thus avoid the cycle of “performative productivity” for employees. Instead, empower employees to prioritize meaningful work—activities that drive long-term value even if they don’t yield immediate results. Easier said than done, yes, but prioritizing employee productivity that goes beyond the optics is a win-win as it delivers value for the organization while signaling to employee that their contribution matters. Managers not as a boss but becoming what employees need, want, and expect. Today’s managers are squeezed between the top-down pressures of leadership and the bottom-up expectations of their teams. And yet, their success hinges on how their employee perform. In this new era, traditional management roles no longer suffice. To help employees do well, it behooves managers to transition from being 'Da Boss’ to becoming what employees need. Become an Agile Coach. The AI revolution is reshaping employee skill sets needed for organizations to innovate and stay competitive. Managers should partner with employees to identify gaps and create personalized development plans. This reskilling may call for supporting employees in carving out time for self-training, for sourcing learning opportunities, or connecting them to programs from educational institutions or industry groups. Serve as a Guide and Cheerleader. In environments where layoffs loom, many employees struggle to articulate their value. Be a spokesperson who brings employee challenges and concerns to leadership just as you can help amplify their contributions and offer visibility that go beyond short-term KPIs. Recalibrate Expectations and Model Resilience. Sometimes, tough love is necessary. If teamwork or long-term thinking is being undervalued in today’s ‘what’s in it for me’ mindset, it’s the manager’s job to recalibrate values and re-center collaboration. Employees look to their managers for guidance when there is ambiguity and therefore, modeling behaviors your employees need to thrive may be vital. In these uncertain times, what employee may need the most is a leader who conveys resilience, strength, and positivity. Myth of work-life balance as businessman lay down working at home using laptop and headset for ... More conference call meeting and take care his daughter child playing with cat In today’s always-on world, Employees report being perpetually in a crunch mode with long hours, unrelenting urgency and being constantly checked in. Burnout is rampant, not from lack of time off, but from the inability to truly disconnect. The busyness of work that begins as a badge of honor results significant burnout that chokes individual’s productivity. For a long time, work-life balance was viewed as a panacea. However, in today’s hyper-connected world, the idea of balance is viewed as being unrealistic and can makes things worse by setting unreasonable expectations. So, instead of work-life balance, consider the concept of work-life boundary that makes a case for clear demarcation between work and non-work lives. Boundaries can be time-bound such as the traditional 9 to 5 workday, or psychological, as in checking out mentally from the job demands to focus on personal life or even emotional, that is, a taking a break from the stresses and strain of work demands. Unfortunately, employees often lack the ability or the autonomy to engage in any of these boundary controls. Managers can help. It could mean respecting employee’s preference for personal time, empowering employees to develop a more structured work-life, or modeling behaviors that give autonomy to the employees to take a break from work. Championing and enabling work-life boundary may be key to fostering a culture of well-being where reducing anxiety, burnout, and stress is a priority. A Gallup study of Fortune 500 CHROs revealed a critical blind spot: while most expect their employees to prefer blended work-life models, almost half of the surveyed employee actually prefer clear separation. This mismatch is a silent driver of disengagement—and a unique opportunity for managers to lead differently and win employee trust by giving them autonomy to manage their preference for work-life boundary. Admittedly not all job types allow accommodating employee desire for boundary control. For instance, a 9 to 5 work routine is not an option in healthcare setting but being open and approachable to helping employees figure out strategies for crafting their work arrangement can significantly help support hyper-stressed and over-worked employees. Two decades ago, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard penned Let My People Go Surfing, advocating for flexible time away from work. Despite generous PTO policies, a 2024 Harris Poll found that 75% of U.S. employees don’t use their allotted time off. Why? Pressure to stay connected, fear of job insecurity, and mounting workloads. Today, burnout is at crisis levels. While extended vacations may be impractical during economic downturns, the core idea remains relevant: managers must champion employee well-being to sustain performance. Productivity mandates and efficiency targets may be essential—but they must not come at the cost of human creativity and resilience. Restoring employee agency is not just a feel-good strategy. It’s a competitive advantage. Leaders who listen, advocate, coach, and set boundaries aren’t just surviving the Great Detachment—they're building the kind of workplace where innovation and engagement thrive, even in turbulent times.

Title: SpaceX Tries to Poke Holes in Rival AST SpaceMobile's Next-Gen Satellite Plans

SpaceX is criticizing rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to test a next-generation satellite, arguing that the company’s proposal is flawed and potentially threatens orbital safety. In a Thursday letter to the FCC, SpaceX urged the agency to ensure that "enormous experimental satellites" follow the rules. The FCC is weighing whether to grant an experimental license so AST SpaceMobile can test a larger, more powerful version of its BlueBird satellite. This "FM-1" satellite spans 223 square meters, making it about three times larger than AST's first-gen BlueBird satellites, five of which are currently in orbit. The FM-1 is important since AST aims to launch and operate a fleet of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity for carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. AST is also facing a tight timeline since its partners want to begin offering satellite connectivity to customers as soon as next year. Although SpaceX doesn’t oppose the FM-1 satellite itself, the company has gripes with AST SpaceMobile’s proposal. In its letter to the FCC, SpaceX argues the “experimental license application for the FM-1 satellite contains worrying discrepancies in its orbital debris mitigation plan that require clarification before granting authorization to launch.” The discrepancies include how AST says the FM-1 satellite will be retired in 2.9 years by burning up in the Earth’s atmosphere once the satellite’s mission is complete. SpaceX’s analysis, using NASA software, claims the satellite will orbit the planet for 6.6 years after it completes its mission, violating the FCC’s disposal rule for low-Earth orbiting satellites. In addition, SpaceX claims “the actual collision probability of the FM-1 satellite is close to ten times higher than AST reports,” when other satellites, rocket pieces, and space debris orbit at the same altitude. “Strikingly, AST makes no effort to explain how it can mitigate the harm the ‘largest commercial phased array antenna in LEO’ will cause for optical astronomy,” the letter adds. (That said, AST has been working with the scientific community to address the potential astronomy interference.) SpaceX has become more vocal in attacking AST when both are developing cellular satellite services. In its letter, SpaceX stresses that AST’s new satellite follows the same requirements the company faced when the FCC authorized its second-generation Starlink satellites. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in October, the company accused SpaceX of using anti-competitive tactics to “intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators.” In the meantime, the FCC told AST last week that its application for the FM-1 satellite was "incomplete," and sent AST 10 questions, which AST has until April 15 to address. The FM-1 satellite is currently slated to launch in July, a delay from Q2.

SpaceX is criticizing rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to test a next-generation satellite, arguing that the company’s proposal is flawed and potentially threatens orbital safety. In a Thursday letter to the FCC, SpaceX urged the agency to ensure that "enormous experimental satellites" follow the rules. The FCC is weighing whether to grant an experimental license so AST SpaceMobile can test a larger, more powerful version of its BlueBird satellite. This "FM-1" satellite spans 223 square meters, making it about three times larger than AST's first-gen BlueBird satellites, five of which are currently in orbit. The FM-1 is important since AST aims to launch and operate a fleet of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity for carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. AST is also facing a tight timeline since its partners want to begin offering satellite connectivity to customers as soon as next year. Although SpaceX doesn’t oppose the FM-1 satellite itself, the company has gripes with AST SpaceMobile’s proposal. In its letter to the FCC, SpaceX argues the “experimental license application for the FM-1 satellite contains worrying discrepancies in its orbital debris mitigation plan that require clarification before granting authorization to launch.” The discrepancies include how AST says the FM-1 satellite will be retired in 2.9 years by burning up in the Earth’s atmosphere once the satellite’s mission is complete. SpaceX’s analysis, using NASA software, claims the satellite will orbit the planet for 6.6 years after it completes its mission, violating the FCC’s disposal rule for low-Earth orbiting satellites. In addition, SpaceX claims “the actual collision probability of the FM-1 satellite is close to ten times higher than AST reports,” when other satellites, rocket pieces, and space debris orbit at the same altitude. “Strikingly, AST makes no effort to explain how it can mitigate the harm the ‘largest commercial phased array antenna in LEO’ will cause for optical astronomy,” the letter adds. (That said, AST has been working with the scientific community to address the potential astronomy interference.) SpaceX has become more vocal in attacking AST when both are developing cellular satellite services. In its letter, SpaceX stresses that AST’s new satellite follows the same requirements the company faced when the FCC authorized its second-generation Starlink satellites. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in October, the company accused SpaceX of using anti-competitive tactics to “intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators.” In the meantime, the FCC told AST last week that its application for the FM-1 satellite was "incomplete," and sent AST 10 questions, which AST has until April 15 to address. The FM-1 satellite is currently slated to launch in July, a delay from Q2.

The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Title: What to expect as Iran and US head for more nuclear talks in Oman
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/25/what-to-expect-as-iran-and-us-head-for-more-nuclear-talks-in-oman

The expert-level technical talks could determine the specifics of nuclear and sanctions commitments by the two sides. Tehran, Iran – Iran and the United States are expected to hold more nuclear negotiations mediated by Oman amid efforts to shape an agreement to avoid the US attacking Iran. The Iranian delegation will arrive in Muscat on Friday evening in advance of political and, for the first time, technical talks on Saturday. Let’s take a look at what we can expect, as well as all the latest developments and context. Like the two previous rounds of talks in Italy and Oman, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the delegations. But the experts leading the technical talks are also crucial, as they will iron out the details and wording of any agreement. For Tehran, Araghchi’s political deputy, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, and deputy for legal and international affairs, Kazem Gharibabadi, are heading the expert-level delegation. Takht-Ravanchi is a Western-educated diplomat who led Iran’s mission to the United Nations and was ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Gharibabadi led Iran’s representative office to international organisations in Vienna and represented the Iranian judiciary internationally. He was also involved in indirect nuclear negotiations between the administrations of late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and former US President Joe Biden. The chief technical expert whom US President Donald Trump selected is Michael Anton, the newly appointed director of policy planning at the US Department of State. Anton was a speechwriter for New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice during the George W Bush administration. He also held managerial roles in the private sector, including at Citigroup and BlackRock investment firms. During the first Trump administration, he served on the National Security Council to shape government messaging. Anton’s work may be eased by the fact that he has not yet publicly adopted a stance on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran has emphasised it will not discuss its defence capabilities or regional influence, but is ready for an agreement that ensures it won’t build a nuclear bomb, which it has repeatedly stated it doesn’t want. The technical talks aim to set the steps Tehran would take to curb its nuclear programme, and how Washington and Europe would lift their devastating sanctions, which have continued despite the US calling the talks with Iran “constructive”. Iran, for its part, wants to lift at least part of the comprehensive sanctions against its oil, banking and related industries, some of which are imposed under multiple designations. A deal could unfreeze some of Iran’s billions of dollars of export revenue that remain blocked in foreign banks by sanctions. Negotiators may also attempt to nail down waivers, orders to allow Iran to sell oil or access the global payments system. Iranian officials like President Masoud Pezeshkian have gone a step further, saying Iran would even welcome direct, large-scale investment by US companies in its market, which is brimming with financial opportunity. On the agenda will also be a cap on Iran’s uranium enrichment, which is now at up to 60 percent, a short step from the 90 percent required for a bomb. Under the terms of an earlier nuclear agreement with world powers (the JCPOA), Iran had committed to a cap of 3.67 percent enrichment, sufficient for civilian uses like power generation. However, when Trump unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA in 2018 and slapped punishing sanctions on Iran, Tehran started enriching at much higher levels and using more advanced reactors than those specified in the JCPOA. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog that will again monitor Iran’s commitments, is expected to send a team to Iran in the next few days for talks. While likely to advance the positive atmosphere surrounding the talks, Saturday’s meetings are only a step among many required for any deal. But time is of the essence, especially in the months leading up to an October deadline, when the 2015 nuclear deal’s “snapback” mechanism expires. It allows any of the signatories to initiate a process to reinstate all UN sanctions on Iran in the case of significant noncompliance, like enriching uranium at levels higher than 3.67 percent. Iran wants to avoid snapback. Iran’s Araghchi has visited China and Russia to coordinate a position, while accusing Israel of “undermining” the negotiations. Witkoff was also in Moscow on Friday to discuss the talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Araghchi has said he is ready to visit Paris, Berlin and London for direct talks with the three European JCPOA signatories. “I was ready to do it before Iran commenced its indirect dialogue with the U.S., but the E3 opted out,” he wrote on X. Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei signalled to his followers, using religious symbolism, this week, that they must not refuse a deal with the US. He recounted how Jafar al-Sadiq, the sixth imam revered in Shia Islam, made a deal with his enemy some 1,300 years ago, adding that any deal would not indicate the “dominance of disbelief and deceit” over Muslims.

Title: Why is Germany's next chancellor, Merz, so unpopular?

Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz and his CDU won Germany's election, yet his personal popularity is low — and getting lower. Most Germans don't trust him, not least because of his approach to the far-right AfD. If all goes to plan, Friedrich Merz will become the Federal Republic's 10th chancellor on May 6. The two remaining hurdles appear to be formalities: On Monday, his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will convene for a special party conference to approve the coalition contract with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Then, a few days later, the SPD's members — some grumbling notwithstanding — are expected to approve the alliance in a vote, with the results announced on April 30. But Merz won't have long to enjoy the congratulations. Even though he won the national election in late February, the 69-year-old's personal popularity seems to be on a permanent slide: According to an April poll by research institute Forsa for Stern magazine, just 21% of respondents consider Merz trustworthy — nine percentage points lower than in August, and down three points from January. The same poll found that only 40% of respondents consider the incoming chancellor a strong leader, and 27% think Merz "knows what moves people," both of which represent nine-point falls since January. On the plus side — indeed, the only leadership criteria in which Merz scored a majority in the survey — about 60% of respondents believe that Merz "speaks understandably." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video It's no shock that Merz isn't exactly the most popular chancellor-in-waiting Germany has ever seen. But Ursula Münch, the director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW that it's not all his fault. "The circumstances are very different than they used to be," Münch said. "We have a government that has a relatively small proportion of support among voters." Merz has not picked the most fortunate moment in history: In traditional political parlance, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD is called a "grand coalition," because for many decades these two parties represented an overwhelming majority of Germany's voters (sometimes well over 80%). In the fragmented landscape of 2025, in which parties have splintered and splintered again over the past 20 years, the two big centrist parties can only claim to represent 45% of voters, going by the February election results. There are two obvious reasons why the perception of Merz's trustworthiness might have fallen in the past few months. In January, Merz broke his own word when he became the first CDU leader to pass a motion through the Bundestag with the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whole factions of which are deemed by intelligence agencies to be a threat to Germany's democratic order. For CDU supporters, however, that seemed like a less-egregious U-turn than the one Merz performed a few weeks later: In March, the party leader agreed a debt brake reform with the SPD and the Greens that paved the way for €1 trillion ($1.14 trillion) in new loans, something he had expressly ruled out throughout the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, many of his voters felt betrayed. In a "Politbarometer" poll carried out by public broadcaster ZDF at the time, some 73% of Germans agreed that he had deceived voters — including some 44% of CDU/CSU supporters. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Merz has problems that go much further back than his recent U-turns. Surveys have shown that he is particularly unpopular among women. A Forsa survey from March 2024 found that only 9% of women aged 18 to 29 saw Merz as their preferred chancellor candidate. The incoming chancellor has been dogged with accusations of misogyny. In 1997, as is often brought up, he was one of the Bundestag members who voted against recognizing rape within marriage as a crime. In October last year, he was criticized for rejecting the idea of gender-balanced Cabinets, and this reputation was not helped by a photo released in February showing that the main negotiators of the CDU/CSU bloc were all middle-aged men. Merz is also unpopular in eastern Germany, where he regularly polled behind both the AfD's Alice Weidel and the SPD's Olaf Scholz in the run-up to the election — partly, it seems, because of his belligerent attitude toward Russia. Merz's calculation appears to be that, with right-wing populism apparently on rise around the world, what people want is straight-talking leadership. But populism does not appear to be making him more popular. In November 2018, when he first announced his candidacy to re-take the leadership of the CDU, Merz posted a tweet that seems to age worse with every month: "We can once again reach up to 40% and halve the AfD. That is possible!" he wrote. "But we must create the preconditions for it. That is our task." Almost the opposite has happened. Since Merz eventually re-took the CDU leadership in January 2022 (on his third attempt), the party's poll ratings have stayed at 24%, while the AfD's have not halved but doubled: From 11% to 24%. Germany's far-right and center-right parties are now neck and neck. But, of course, Merz has not had a chance to be chancellor yet, and Münch said he might yet be able to make good on his AfD prediction — if his government runs without the internal strife that dogged Scholz's coalition, and if it is not hit by an external crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic or escalating war in Ukraine that would requires the chancellor to take more U-turns and lose even more trust. Those are big ifs. "The best way to keep the AfD small isn't making some random announcement about big changes in refugee policy that you can't implement," Münch said. "It's concrete measures that people also notice. But that's not something that a new government can just turn around overnight. People need to be given confidence again, and that will only be possible when the economic forecast turns more positive and the refugee numbers fall." Merz was initially considered a strong candidate precisely because of his business background (he was on the board at the investment company BlackRock for several years), which was supposed to signal his economic acumen. In the past few years, however, his populist statements have increasingly been about immigration, and that hasn't helped him shake off the AfD.

Title: The Meta Trial Shows the Dangers of Selling Out

Meta has a lot at stake in the current FTC lawsuit against it. In theory a negative verdict could result in a company breakup. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg once faced an even bigger existential threat. Back in 2006, his investors and even his employees were pressuring him to sell his two-year-old startup for a quick payoff. Facebook was still a college-based social network, and several companies were interested in buying it. The most serious offer came from Yahoo, which offered a stunning $1 billion. Zuckerberg, though, believed he could grow the company into something worth much more. The pressure was tremendous, and at one point he blinked, agreeing in principle to sell. But immediately after that, a dip in Yahoo stock led its leader at the time, Terry Semel, to ask for a price adjustment. Zuckerberg seized the opportunity to shut down negotiations; Facebook would remain in his hands. “That was by far the most stressful time in my life,” Zuckerberg told me years later. So it’s ironic to observe, through the testimony of this trial, how he treated two other sets of founders in very similar situations to him—but whom he successfully bought out. This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech. The nub of the current FTC trial seems to hinge on how US District Court judge James Boasberg will define Meta’s market—whether it’s limited to social media or, as Meta is arguing, the broader field of “entertainment.” But much of the early testimony exhumed the details of Zuckerberg’s successful pursuit of Instagram and WhatsApp—two companies that, according to the government, are now part of Meta’s illegal monopolistic grip on social media. (The trial also invoked the case of Snap, which resisted Zuckerberg’s $6 billion offer and had to deal with Facebook copying its products.) Legalities aside, the way these companies were upended by a Zuckerberg offer made the first few days of this case a dramatic and instructive study of acquisition dynamics between small and big business. Though almost all of these narratives have been covered at length over the years—I documented them pretty thoroughly in my own 2020 account Facebook: The Inside Story—it was striking to see the principals testifying under oath about what happened. Hey, my sources were pretty good, but I didn’t get to swear them in! In their testimony, star witnesses Zuckerberg and Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom agreed on facts, but their interpretations were Mars and Venus. In 2012, Instagram was about to close a $500 million investment round, when suddenly the tiny company found itself in play, with Facebook in hot pursuit. In an email at the time, Facebook’s CFO asked Zuckerberg if his goal was to “neutralize a potential competitor.” The answer was affirmative. That was not the way he pitched it to Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger. Zuckerberg promised the cofounders they would control Instagram and could grow it their way. They would have the best of both worlds—independence and Facebook’s huge resources. Oh, and Facebook’s $1 billion offer was double the valuation of the company in the funding round it was about to close. Everything worked great for a few years, but then Zuckerberg began denying resources to Instagram, which its cofounders had built into a juggernaut. Systrom testified that Zuckerberg seemed envious of Instagram’s success and cultural currency, saying that his boss “believed we were hurting Facebook’s growth.” Zuckerberg’s snubs ultimately drove Instagram's founders to leave in 2018. By that time, Instagram was arguably worth perhaps 100 times Zuckerberg’s purchase price. Systrom and Krieger’s spoils, though considerable, did not reflect the fantastic value they had built for Facebook. The founders of WhatsApp did reap a stratospheric buyout, because in 2014 Zuckerberg threw $19 billion to acquire their then tiny operation. But, as told through testimony of some of its executives and funders, the acquisition hinged on promises that cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum would retain control. The WhatsApp cofounders hated advertising and were adamant that no ads should ever appear on their service. But documents introduced in the trial indicated that Facebook was basing its valuation on the premise that WhatsApp would be monetized, apparently with those despised ads. The founders left in 2018, when it became clear that Zuckerberg was calling the shots. “I espoused a certain set of principles, even publicly, to my users, and I said, Look, we are not gonna sell your data, we are not going to sell you ads, and I turned around and sold my company,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. His penance for this “crime,” he told me, was spending $50 million to create the Signal Foundation. Though these founders were pressured to sell, there weren’t literal guns to their heads—and they did cash out in exchange for pursuing their dreams. So we shouldn’t feel too sorry for them. But lately people in Silicon Valley have been chattering about startup guru Paul Graham’s “Founder Mode” theory, which assumes that the person most responsible for creating a company is the best one to run it—and that the world itself benefits from such people. Zuckerberg, of course, is an iconic founder. But the trial is revealing a narrative beyond the FTC’s legal argument about anticompetitive acquisitions: Zuckerberg’s penchant for snuffing out founders to advance his own goals. Of course, sometimes founders are well advised to take the money and run. Consider the case of Clubhouse, the audio-based social networking product that exploded during the pandemic. Its founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, fended off multiple suitors, including a rumored $4 billion offer from Twitter. But after the pandemic—and some poor strategic choices—the service deflated like a punctured balloon. In 2023 it laid off half of its staff. On the other hand, it’s still around, and at least in one of its recent town halls, Davison still seemed to be having fun. One question that Mark Zuckerberg did not have to answer during his testimony was how he viewed his own transition from prey to predator. But I did pose that question to him during my book research. We were discussing the mental anguish he suffered during the 2006 crisis. Zuckerberg told me that he often advises young founders not to give in to pressure. This advice, of course, was not offered to those running companies he wanted to buy. So I asked him directly—given his lesson from the Yahoo experience, did Systrom and Krieger make a mistake by selling to him? There was a long pause, not an uncommon phenomenon when Zuckerberg considers a question where a candid answer might put him in a damning position. Finally he gave a response that dodged the issue, saying that Instagram could never have reached its heights without Facebook’s support. He said pretty much the same thing in court this month. On a legal basis, Meta will not be judged on how he bought off the dreams of founders, but whether he gamed the marketplace through his purchases. No judge will rule on the calculus of selling off a dream. In Kevin Systrom’s testimony, he opined that Zuckerberg denied resources to Instagram in part out of jealousy. The photo-sharing app, which he didn’t invent, was growing faster than Facebook’s blue app, a Mark Zuckerberg Production. When reporting Facebook: The Inside Story, I became familiar with this tension and put it to Zuckerberg: Was he in fact jealous of the Instagram team? “Jealous…” he repeated. Yes, I said. And that you would prefer growth of Facebook’s Blue app to Instagram’s? He said no, and explained to me how he thought about it. Early on … it made sense to leave the founders alone and let them build their best products. “That was incredibly successful,” he says. “And it made sense for the first five years. But now we’re at the point where all the products are big and important. I don’t want to build just multiple versions of the same product. We should have a more coherent and integrated product strategy.” And if that meant losing founders, so be it. “I can understand if you’re an entrepreneur who built one of those things and had awesome success, you’d wake up and say, ‘Okay, I’m proud of what I did, but this isn’t for me going forward.’ That’s how I see it, and we’re going in the right direction.” Those close to Kevin Systrom, though, believe that had Zuckerberg not asserted control, he would have remained at Instagram for 20 more years. Jim asks, “What was it like interviewing some of the pioneers of modern-day computing for Hackers?” Thanks for the question, Jim. You are asking me to access the feelings I had over 40 years ago when I was talking first-hand to people who are now legends. But in the circles I traveled they were virtually unknown, even computer science pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. And to my knowledge no reporter had documented the world of MIT hackers, who pretty much invented computer culture. I do recall as the interviews accumulated, I came to realize that the story I was telling was significant and would have continuing relevance. Also, some of them outright stretched my mind. These people were so interesting that after the book was published I kept talking to computer folk. I still am. Submit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): YouTube tests AI Overviews carousel in search results. YouTube is experimenting with an AI Overviews feature that surfaces short clips from videos deemed most relevant to a user's search query. Available only to a small number of US-based YouTube Premium users, the AI-generated highlights are presented in a carousel format within search results. The test applies only to select English-language queries related to product research or travel. This feature mirrors the controversial AI Overviews in Google Search, which have been linked to declining site traffic. Importance for marketers: If widely deployed, AI Overviews could reduce visibility and video views, affecting branded content discoverability on YouTube. Trump signs executive order launching AI education initiative. President Trump has issued an executive order establishing a national AI education initiative and a new White House Task Force on AI Education. The order directs resources toward AI training in schools, teacher development, and an AI-focused Presidential Challenge. Despite recent cuts to the Department of Education, the administration aims to prioritize AI in discretionary grants and research. The initiative's success will depend on cross-sector collaboration and effective coordination across government departments. Importance for marketers: Broader AI literacy and workforce readiness could accelerate AI adoption across industries, influencing future demand for AI-based marketing solutions and services. Google finds UK workers can save 122 hours a year using AI for admin tasks. Google's AI Works pilot program in the UK showed that workers—especially older women in lower-income roles—can save 122 hours annually using AI for administrative tasks. Simple interventions like training and "permission to prompt" doubled AI usage among participants. The study suggests AI adoption barriers include legitimacy concerns and lack of confidence. With minor training, weekly AI usage rose from 17% to 56%. Google estimates AI adoption could add £400 billion to the UK economy. Importance for marketers: Demonstrates measurable time savings and the importance of upskilling, with implications for marketing operations and productivity improvements. Baidu launches cheaper, upgraded AI models to stay competitive. Baidu introduced two improved versions of its Ernie chatbot—Ernie 4.5 Turbo and Ernie X1 Turbo—at significantly reduced cost. The Ernie 4.5 Turbo model is now 80% cheaper than its predecessor, while the reasoning-focused X1 Turbo is 50% less expensive. The move comes amid rising competition from Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Zhipu AI, as well as global leaders like OpenAI. Baidu's share price rose after the announcement. Importance for marketers: Lower pricing and improved performance from Chinese AI providers could increase global adoption, reduce costs for marketers, and spark competitive pricing shifts across the industry. OpenAI introduces 'lightweight' version of deep research tool. OpenAI has released a "lightweight" version of its deep research tool powered by the o4-mini model. It's now available to free users (limited to five tasks/month) and paid tiers. The tool offers shorter, cost-effective responses while retaining research depth and quality. Paid users get higher limits: 25 monthly tasks for Plus/Team, 250 for Pro. Enterprise and Education plans will get access soon. The new version is significantly cheaper to run, helping OpenAI reduce costs. Importance for marketers: Expanded access to deep research tools enables teams to extract insights and automate content generation more affordably and efficiently. Microsoft reveals it used AI to create ad that went unnoticed. Microsoft disclosed that it produced a Surface Pro and Surface Laptop ad using generative AI without public awareness. The ad, released in January, used AI for quick-cut shots and background visuals, while detailed movements were shot live. Microsoft says the approach saved 90% of time and cost compared to traditional methods. Designers used AI for scripting, imagery, and iteration. Despite being live for months, no viewers flagged the AI elements. Importance for marketers: This case illustrates that well-integrated AI can reduce production costs and timelines without compromising quality or raising viewer skepticism. Kuaishou debuts upgraded Kling AI video generator, touts global leadership. Kuaishou unveiled Kling 2.0, claiming it to be the world's most powerful AI video generator. It features improved realism, motion quality, and prompt handling. Kling has already produced over 168 million videos and 344 million images. Importance for marketers: Advanced generative video tools like Kling 2.0 offer scalable, high-quality video creation options for brand storytelling and engagement—potentially at a fraction of traditional production costs. Ziff Davis sues OpenAI over copyright infringement. Digital media company Ziff Davis has filed suit against OpenAI, alleging that the AI firm copied content from outlets like IGN, PCMag, and CNET without permission. Ziff Davis claims OpenAI ignored its robots.txt directives and stripped copyright notices from scraped data. It joins The New York Times and others in a wave of lawsuits against OpenAI over training data use. The company is seeking damages and deletion of affected datasets. Importance for marketers: The growing legal pressure may influence how AI companies use web content, affecting SEO, content licensing, and the discoverability of brand content.

NTT will also launch an OpenAI-focused center of excellence and offer an AI use case accelerator program to 100 major companies. The partnership aims to achieve $697M in related revenue by 2027. Importance for marketers: Expanding enterprise-grade AI in Japan presents a strong use case for industry-specific AI applications in marketing automation and customer engagement. Adobe and Figma adopt ChatGPT's upgraded image generator. OpenAI's powerful "gpt-image-1" model is now available via API, enabling Adobe and Figma to embed it in their tools. Users can generate and edit images from prompts, adjust styles, and render text with high fidelity. Canva, GoDaddy, and others are also exploring integrations. Importance for marketers: Enhanced image-generation tools within popular creative platforms will streamline design workflows and visual content creation for marketers, speeding campaign development and iteration. OpenAI expresses interest in acquiring Chrome for AI-first experience. OpenAI's head of product said the company would consider buying Google Chrome if antitrust rulings forced its sale. OpenAI has already hired key former Chrome developers and considered building its own browser. Integrating ChatGPT into a browser with Chrome's user base could give OpenAI massive distribution and training data for agentic AI. Importance for marketers: An OpenAI-owned browser could significantly reshape web discovery and behavior, affecting SEO, advertising placement, and content strategy. Adobe adds new Firefly models and third-party AI tools to Creative Cloud. Adobe introduced Firefly Image Model 4 and 4 Ultra, offering faster, more controllable, and higher-quality image generation. The web app now supports OpenAI, Google, and others for image and video generation. Adobe maintains its models are "commercially safe" due to licensed training data.

OpenAI and Shopify prepare native ChatGPT shopping integration. Code found in ChatGPT's assets shows signs of a direct Shopify checkout experience embedded in the chat interface. Users may soon browse, review, and purchase products without leaving ChatGPT. The feature appears close to launch and mirrors moves by Microsoft and Perplexity toward in-chat commerce. Importance for marketers: Native shopping in ChatGPT could open a powerful new sales channel, enabling frictionless AI-assisted buying journeys and direct product exposure for Shopify merchants. Investor claims AI is already replacing workers—especially in law and HR. VC Victor Lazarte claims AI is "fully replacing people," particularly in legal and HR roles. Critics point to recent courtroom mishaps involving flawed AI-generated legal documents as evidence that the technology isn't ready. Meanwhile, biased hiring AI continues to disadvantage certain job seekers. Importance for marketers: The rhetoric around AI replacement may shape how companies evaluate automation tools. Marketers must balance AI use with brand reputation, ethics, and accuracy—especially in regulated or people-centric sectors. Meta expands AI assistant access on Ray-Ban smart glasses in Europe. Meta is rolling out its Meta AI assistant to Ray-Ban smart glasses users in seven European countries. The AI can respond to voice prompts, offer translations, and identify real-world objects. The expansion follows regulatory delays in the EU. Importance for marketers: Smart glasses with AI capabilities represent an emerging touchpoint for hyper-contextual marketing and real-world engagement—especially valuable for retail, travel, and local discovery applications. IMF: AI's economic gains will outweigh emissions costs. The IMF estimates AI could boost global GDP by 0.5% annually from 2025–2030, outweighing increased emissions from energy-hungry data centers. Still, the report warns that benefits won't be distributed equally, and urges more sustainable deployment. Importance for marketers: This reinforces the importance of aligning AI innovation with ESG goals. Marketers promoting AI solutions should address sustainability and societal impact to resonate with stakeholders and regulators. YouTube adds AI-generated background music tool for creators. YouTube's new "Music assistant" lets creators generate copyright-free instrumental tracks by entering text prompts. Available to some users of the Creator Music beta, it generates multiple options for download and editing. Importance for marketers: The tool enables fast, legal background music creation for video content, helping brands produce compliant multimedia assets without relying on stock libraries. Creators Guild of America launches legal CGA Rider to protect content creators. The CGA has released a binding "CGA Rider" document that creators can attach to contracts with brands or agencies. It covers content rights, payment terms, revision limits, and AI usage permissions. Several platforms have already adopted it. Importance for marketers: As AI use and content reuse increase, marketers must align with creator rights protections. Using CGA-backed standards helps foster trust and compliance in influencer partnerships. Italian newspaper Il Foglio finds success with AI-written sections. Il Foglio published a daily four-page AI-written section for a month and plans to continue weekly. Editor Claudio Cerasa says AI excels at irony and summarizing books, but lacks critical thinking. The trial boosted sales and readership.

Title: Market Volatility And Monday Morning Quarterbacks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2025/04/25/market-volatility-and-monday-morning-quarterbacks/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T13:49:08Z

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Google announced earnings that were better than expected, however, the company warned of headwinds ... More because of tariffs. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Updated, April 25, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the spelling of Procter & Gamble. Key Takeaways Stocks staged a broad rally on Thursday, led by tech stocks. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.75%. That was followed by both the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, both gaining 2%. Meantime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a gain of 1.2%. Ten of the 11 S&P sectors closed higher with Consumer Staples being the only sector to close lower. As we get further into earnings season, we’re seeing a continuation of something that began with United Airlines. Companies are struggling when it comes to forecasting in this environment. Alphabet, who beat on their earnings report, said tariffs will be a headwind. American Airlines, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and others have all specifically called out the unique nature of the current geopolitical situation and economic policies being implemented. We’re also seeing massive shifts in supply chains. Apple recently announced it hopes to move most iPhone production to India by 2026. I expect these types of announcements and changes will continue as we get earnings reports from more household-type names. Right now, the only trend to this market is that there is no trend. Technicians and fundamentalists are all struggling to make heads or tails of what is happening. That makes for a challenging situation. Therefore, I think it's important to take a step back here and discuss the broader trading and investing environment as well as how it might make sense to approach the market. We are seeing a heightened level of volatility sustain itself. Even if you are not someone who trades options, this is important because higher volatility means the expected trading ranges for stocks will be wider. It was just a few months ago when the expected move in the S&P 500 was +/- 50 points for a week. Friday alone the expected move in the S&P 500 is over 60 points and looking to next week, the expected move is over 170 points. Those large, expected moves in the index trickle down to individual stocks as well. Apple has an expected move Friday of $4 whereas a couple months ago, expected moves of the day were half that. Large moves have practical implications for both investors and traders. If you are someone who invests in stocks and does dollar cost averaging, you’ll want to take the wider trading ranges into consideration. If you were buying more stock anytime price fell 1%, you may now want to wait for 1.5% to 2%. You should also expect a greater volatility in your account value when market volatility is higher. At the moment, with the VIX around 27, the market's daily expected moves are around 1.5x historical averages. If you have a portfolio that is closely correlated to the market, expect your daily swings to be larger. If you are an options trader, a higher volatility market is what you want. Option premium is what we call, “rich.” What that means is, if you could normally collect $5 selling something like a put that expires in a month, you can now collect $7.50 to $10. Greater volatility means people are willing to pay more for options, this of course makes sense with puts to many people, as you see the downside protection. But those short calls, be it in a covered call or spread, may not go down as much as expected. Again, higher volatility, means that a wider range of stock movement (both up and down) is expected, so all options hold more premium. One of the most important things when volatility is like this is keeping position size small and defining your risk before you place a trade. These types of markets will bring out a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacks, meaning it'll be easy to say what you should have done. Before you go beating yourself up with what you should have sold or should have bought, remind yourself that there is an emotional aspect of trading. I've been doing this my entire adult life and I still succumb to the emotional aspects at times. Therefore, understanding your risk tolerance ahead of time is crucial, it helps take as much emotion as possible out of the trade as you have already walked through mentally, what can go wrong. For today, I'm keeping an eye on volatility. Some of the more esoteric measures of volatility actually have come down over the past few days, and ideally, we'll see that carry over into the VIX. However, next week is a big week for economic data and earnings. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report and employment for April are just two of the many economic reports due. Then companies like Apple and Meta Platforms, among a number of other companies, are scheduled to announce earnings. Therefore, I'm not so sure we'll see that VIX contraction just yet. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Title: Spatchcock a chicken for an easy — and inexpensive — meal for 4
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/25/spatchcock-chicken-recipe/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T13:20:26Z
Full Content:
By Gretchen McKay, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette With decades of cooking and testing recipes under my apron, I’m no spring chicken. (Sadly.) But I certainly love to eat a good spring chicken, especially if preparing the meal for my family entails an easy recipe that’s built on inexpensive, everyday pantry ingredients and fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables. This simple, budget-minded dinner for four is perfect for the first sunny days of spring. Nothing is more comforting than the aroma of a roasting chicken, but when you’re busy with work or kids or just would rather spend those two or three hours outdoors, you might consider that a stuck-indoors, winter activity. Yet if you follow my lead and spatchcock (butterfly) a whole bird — removing the backbone and then cracking it with the heel of your hands to flatten it — you will not only cut precious cooking time in half, but the breasts and thighs will also cook more evenly. As for the sides, shine a light on carrots and a salad of tender butterhead lettuce tossed with crunchy radish and cucumber. To keep costs down, I shopped at several stores rather than filling my shopping cart at the most convenient (and often more expensive) grocery. For instance, when a whole roaster chicken found where I do most of my everyday shopping looked like it was going to eat up too much of my $25 budget, I talked myself into using chicken thighs instead. Then, I happened to dash into Aldi to pick up a last-minute bag of lemons ($2.89) after a little shoe shopping and, voila! I found a plump, 4-pound roaster in the meat section for just $8.59 and I was back to my original plan. While the carrots I sliced and roasted as a side dish were downright cheap at 99 cents per pound, the $3 I paid for a nice-sized head of fresh Boston lettuce was a bit of a surprise. At least the radishes and cucumber were cheap. Eggs are still kind of pricey, even at today’s “bargain” price of around $5 a dozen. But the crumbly, shortbread-like French butter cookies I made for dessert (followed by late-night snacking) only required two, so no big whoop, right? Not to sound like a broken record, but this probably bears repeating in these tough economic times: Smart shoppers peruse their refrigerators and pantries before they go grocery shopping, both to get some fresh ideas for dinner (what leftovers aren’t people eating?) and to make sure they don’t buy something they already have or need to use up ASAP. They also make sure their stomachs are full so there’s no impulse buying or taking shortcuts with already-prepared foods, which tend to be more expensive than scratch dishes. Ingredients I was able to leave off my shopping list (but wouldn’t have added a lot to the final tally) include the olive oil and mustard used in the vinaigrette and marinade, a cup and a half of rice to serve with the chicken, and some of the spices and herbs used for flavoring and aromatics. I also am lucky to have an uber-local source for high-quality honey: my niece Amanda’s husband, Phil, a firefighter at Fire Station 34 in Perry North, has five hives in his Brighton Heights yard. Setting a plate of cookies on the table is always a great way to end a meal. And a new French cookbook that recently landed on my desk made it super easy to choose one that was fancy enough to feel like a true dessert, but didn’t require any hardcore baking skills. My husband and grandson weren’t the only ones who loved them — my co-workers gobbled them up in a matter of minutes when I brought half the batch into the office. You’ll adore them, too. Those responsible for putting dinner on the table each night will appreciate the cost of the entire meal even more: just $24.83, or around $6.20 per person for a family of four. Serves 4, PG tested This zesty vinaigrette gets its bright flavor from citrus and fresh herbs.

Title: Spatchcock a chicken for an easy — and inexpensive — meal for 4

By Gretchen McKay, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette With decades of cooking and testing recipes under my apron, I’m no spring chicken. (Sadly.) But I certainly love to eat a good spring chicken, especially if preparing the meal for my family entails an easy recipe that’s built on inexpensive, everyday pantry ingredients and fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables. This simple, budget-minded dinner for four is perfect for the first sunny days of spring. Nothing is more comforting than the aroma of a roasting chicken, but when you’re busy with work or kids or just would rather spend those two or three hours outdoors, you might consider that a stuck-indoors, winter activity. Yet if you follow my lead and spatchcock (butterfly) a whole bird — removing the backbone and then cracking it with the heel of your hands to flatten it — you will not only cut precious cooking time in half, but the breasts and thighs will also cook more evenly. As for the sides, shine a light on carrots and a salad of tender butterhead lettuce tossed with crunchy radish and cucumber. To keep costs down, I shopped at several stores rather than filling my shopping cart at the most convenient (and often more expensive) grocery. For instance, when a whole roaster chicken found where I do most of my everyday shopping looked like it was going to eat up too much of my $25 budget, I talked myself into using chicken thighs instead. Then, I happened to dash into Aldi to pick up a last-minute bag of lemons ($2.89) after a little shoe shopping and, voila! I found a plump, 4-pound roaster in the meat section for just $8.59 and I was back to my original plan. While the carrots I sliced and roasted as a side dish were downright cheap at 99 cents per pound, the $3 I paid for a nice-sized head of fresh Boston lettuce was a bit of a surprise. At least the radishes and cucumber were cheap. Eggs are still kind of pricey, even at today’s “bargain” price of around $5 a dozen. But the crumbly, shortbread-like French butter cookies I made for dessert (followed by late-night snacking) only required two, so no big whoop, right?

Kasparov contemplated that if he was playing a human, he would have thought of a few anticipatory moves and used his speed to create tension forcing his opponent to make mistakes. But the emotionless machine had rapidly calculated many moves ahead and played with such tenacity that it unnerved him enough to surrender the game. Kasparov’s defeat marked a major milestone in machine intelligence. I remember the sci-fi fantasy movie Her (2013), in which a lonely man falls in love with his operating system. It becomes his constant companion, sensing his needs and moods and conversing like a human through the day. That science fiction is now real. Launched in early 2023, the AI application, Pi, enables users to create their own personal assistants with the mission to make them happier, healthier, and more productive. This obsession of programmers to teach machines to replicate human behaviour has led to an unprecedented revolution in technology. Pulitzer Prize winning author, Gary Rivlin’s new book AI Valley chronicles the evolution of computing from the early days of the invention of silicon chips, the earliest programming software to the remarkable race being played out right now to win the artificial intelligence battle with trillions of dollars at stake. In the form of a page turning thriller, Rivlin’s book details how AI has rapidly permeated everyone’s lives. The iPhone arranges the photographs you click into albums on its own, word processors correct your grammar, write letters for you, programmes do homework, answer your phone, and pay your bills. Generative AI apps like ChatGPT can now make your still photos dance and even convert screenplays into high quality films. If you had to only read one book about the rapid advances of technology, this is it. Rivlin has covered the history of nearly every player in the race to the top of the game including the VCs who funded and the companies they funded. Companies tumble out of the book at the pace of nearly a company a page, covering Microsoft, Intel, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Google, and hundreds of start-ups including newer AI ones like DeepMind, OpenAI and Nvidia. The biggest hero of this book is easily Satya Nadella. Microsoft, the earliest mover in the computing space was left out when FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) became the new darlings at the stock market. After two decades of no growth, missing the search, mobile computing and social tech revolutions, Nadella rapidly shifted the focus of the organisation to cloud computing and AI when he took over as CEO. With investments in the two largest AI companies OpenAI and Inflection AI, Microsoft swiftly multiplied revenues and within a few years, at $3 trillion in market capitalisation, is back as the hot stock ahead of Google ($1.8 trillion), Amazon ($1.6 trillion), Facebook ($1 trillion) and Netflix ($0.5 trillion). Rivlin uses multiple data points to show how Generative AI is not like a conventional start-up investment due to the large-scale funding needed in mining huge amounts of data, high speed processing computing power and expensive tech talent that just doesn’t get excited with only stock. Even with such high entry barriers, GenAI has managed to raise seed funding of billions of dollars. If this book was a film, it would be the story of Reid Hoffman, a former product manager at Apple, called the Midas VC in Silicon Valley, for his extraordinary ability to seed-fund some of the biggest tech companies of our times and of Suleyman, his protégé, the Syrian whizkid who formed two of the biggest AI companies, DeepMind, and Inflection AI. While Hoffman is the founder of LinkedIn, he’s more famous for his investments in companies like PayPal, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Flikr, Groupon, Convoy, and OpenAI and has used his extensive networking skills to build these companies to great scale. Rivlin says that Hoffman used to brief the Pope at the Vatican annually on how AI will change the world in education, medicine, agriculture and living. DeepMind, for instance, made the most meaningful AI breakthrough in 2022 when it discovered AlphaFold which gave humans an understanding of protein structures that would help new drug discoveries and therapies in pursuit of immortality. The book balances the narrative with the pitfalls and challenges of too much AI, of computers suffering hallucinations, or spewing irrelevant answers occasionally. AI machines need to be continually trained by humans to respect racist, sexist, and religious sentiments as Rivlin warns of the dangers of unregulated AI, with its abilities to create a pandemic or even empty out a bank. AI is not a love affair, it’s a rage, says Rivlin, as he talks of how every VC is hunting for an AI idea to fund and how the companies they fund scramble for supremacy. US politicians have always tried to rein in big-tech and just like the speed of adoption of technology, the call from Congress to testify comes faster too. In 1999, after nearly two decades selling software, Bill Gates was summoned to explain his predatory practice of bunding his software for competitive dominance and threatened to break his company. In under a decade, Facebook was called in on data privacy, but Sam Altman of OpenAI was called in barely within his first year to explain how machines will be stopped from doing evil. When it comes to technology, time and again, it’s been proven how the current leaders of tech are humbled by the new. For instance, the early chatbots Siri and Alexa did not try to improvise like ChatGPT whose strikingly human qualities like the ability to tell a joke, admit mistakes, and ask follow-up questions fetched it 900 million downloads in nine weeks. ChatGPT also leapfrogged Google search and provided direct answers instead of 10 blue ticks for linked articles. The chapter titled ‘Kevin Roose, I love You’ recounts the hilarious incident of how the writer was seeking ideas for Valentine’s Day from the chatbot Sydney when it suggested that it loves him and that he should leave his wife! Time magazine ran the entire transcript where the chatbot told Roose, ‘You make me feel things I never felt before, you make me happy, you make me feel alive!’ It demonstrated the ability of machines to learn how to influence humans and persuade them to act in destructive and harmful ways. The oldest fear about automation has always been that it’ll take away human jobs. The irony then is that the first guy who lost his job due to artificial intelligence was Sam Altman, the young founder of OpenAI, the first AI company, who was sacked by his board for announcing AI to the market before they knew about it. Rivlin chronicles every move and counter move in the drama of his sacking and of his glorious comeback. As you ruminate after reading the book, you realise that every path-breaking technological development since Kasparov’s defeat, be it software, apps, cloud computing and storage, data, voice, and image capture is driving humanity towards its own replacement. In the poignant ending of the movie Her, the man sadly realises that his AI assistant who he is in love with is not exclusive to him but is in love with thousands of humans at the same time. And in the final moment of heartbreak, the AI chatbot is upgraded and vanishes from his computer. His ex-wife comes over to share his grief as they sit on the roof of his apartment building and watch the sunrise over the city. Now that is something AI can’t do!

Title: The Jobs That Will Fall First As AI Takes Over The Workplace

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Artificial intelligence will soon dominate the job market. Artificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed. The big question is how long it will take until technology dominates the job market. You should start thinking about your own career. Will you be caught up in the change? With the U.S. navigating a $36 trillion debt, tariff tensions, and economic uncertainty, the specter of disruption from AI adds urgency for workers to protect themselves. Artificial intelligence is expected to fundamentally transform the global workforce by 2050, according to reports from PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum. Estimates suggest that up to 60% of current jobs will require significant adaptation due to AI. Automation and intelligent systems will become an integral part of the workplace. o remain competitive, invest in skills like critical thinking and digital fluency. Target AI-resilient sectors like healthcare or education. Advocate for retraining programs to reinvent your career. As macro investor and founder of the Bridgewater hedge fund Ray Dalio warns, the economy’s future hinges on balancing AI’s power with human potential. He says those who prepare now will shape the world of tomorrow. Estimates vary, but experts converge on a transformative window of 10 to 30 years for AI to reshape most jobs. A McKinsey report projects that by 2030, 30% of current U.S. jobs could be automated, with 60% significantly altered by AI tools. Goldman Sachs predicts up that to 50% of jobs could be fully automated by 2045, driven by generative AI and robotics. Additionally, Goldman Sachs previously estimated that 300 million jobs could be lost to AI, with 25% of the global labor market being automated. On the bright side, AI is least threatening to labor-intensive careers in construction, skilled trades, installation and repair, and maintenance. Dalio warns of a “great deleveraging” where AI accelerates productivity but displaces workers faster than new roles emerge, potentially within two decades. Larry Fink, the CEO of Black Rock, speaking at the Economic Club of New York this month, cautioned that AI’s impact is already visible in sectors like finance and legal services, predicting a “restructuring” of white-collar work by 2035. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in his shareholder letter, estimates a 15-year horizon for AI to dominate repetitive tasks. The actual pace depends on technological breakthroughs, regulatory frameworks, and economic incentives. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, argues that corporate adoption of AI is accelerating due to cost pressures, potentially shrinking timelines. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent counters that AI could bolster U.S. competitiveness if paired with retraining, delaying mass displacement. By 2040, AI will likely automate or transform 50% to 60% of jobs, with full dominance (80% and higher) possible by 2050, assuming steady innovation. AI’s impact will not be uniform. Some jobs will fall quickly, while others resist longer. Jobs like data entry, scheduling, and customer service are already being overtaken by AI tools like chatbots and robotic process automation. A 2024 study by the Institute for Public Policy Research found 60% of administrative tasks are automatable. Fink notes that BlackRock is streamlining back-office functions with AI, cutting costs. These roles, requiring repetitive data processing, face near-term obsolescence as AI’s accuracy and scalability improve. Bookkeeping, financial modeling, and basic data analysis are highly vulnerable. AI platforms like Bloomberg’s Terminal enhancements can already crunch numbers and generate reports faster than humans. Dimon warns that JPMorgan is automating routine banking tasks, with 20% of analytical roles at risk by 2030. Paralegal work, contract drafting, and legal research are prime targets, as AI tools like Harvey and CoCounsel automate document analysis with 90% accuracy, according to a 2025 Stanford study. Dalio highlights AI’s ability to parse vast datasets, threatening research-heavy roles in academia and consulting. Senior legal strategy and courtroom advocacy, however, will resist longer due to human judgment needs. Graphic design, copywriting, and basic journalism face disruption from tools like DALL-E and GPT-derived platforms, which produce content at scale. A 2024 Pew Research Center that report notes 30% of media jobs could be automated by 2035. Ackman, commenting on X, predicts AI-generated content will dominate advertising soon but argues human creativity in storytelling and high art will endure longer, delaying full automation. Software development, engineering, and data science are dual-edged: AI boosts productivity but also automates routine coding and design tasks. A 2025 World Economic Forum report flags 40% of programming tasks as automatable by 2040. Bessent sees growth in AI-adjacent roles like cybersecurity, but standardized STEM work will gradually cede to algorithms. Complex innovation, like breakthrough research and development, will remain human-driven longer. Diagnostic AI and robotic surgery are advancing, but empathy-driven roles like nursing, therapy, and social work are harder to automate. A 2023 Lancet study estimates 25% of medical administrative tasks could vanish by 2035, but patient-facing care requires human trust. Teaching, especially in nuanced fields like philosophy or early education, and high-level management job rely on emotional intelligence and adaptability, which AI struggles to replicate. A 2024 OECD report suggests only 10% of teaching tasks are automatable by 2040. Dimon and Ackman stress that strategic leadership, navigating ambiguity and inspiring teams, will remain human-centric.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The rise of AI has also driven a surge in its use for nefarious purposes. But Atlanta-based startup Pindrop just hit a new milestone helping fight the increase in fraud that the technology has brought. After more than 10 years in business, the firm surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and such growth is driven by its efforts to fight deepfakes—digitally created hoax recordings, images or videos. CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan said the company has seen a 111% increase in deepfake-related fraud attempts since 2022. The company even had a moment in the spotlight last year: It identified a fraudulent robocall impersonating former President Joe Biden’s voice that was used in New Hampshire to discourage Democrats from voting. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes; Photos by Getty Images: LAW Ho Ming; Michael A. McCoy/Stringer Tesla’s stock surged despite the company posting some of its worst quarterly results in years this week, as Elon Musk said he would step back from his DOGE duties. But even if Musk becomes a more active CEO again, the problems the EV maker faces—like declining profit margins, intensifying competition and a tarnished brand image—aren’t going away anytime soon. Worse, it’s becoming clear Musk has run out of ideas for how to fix them, writes Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. Just one hour after Forbes released an investigation into metaverse company Infinite Reality, which had previously announced a massive $3 billion fundraise from a single anonymous investor, the company revealed the investor’s identity. The company said the investment was “represented by” Sterling Select, a venture firm affiliated with Sterling Equities, whose cofounders are former principal owners of the New York Mets and prominent figures in the New York real estate industry—and known for their ties to Bernie Madoff. Sterling Equities’ general counsel denied any involvement with the funding round. NurPhoto via Getty Images The Chinese government may exempt some goods from its 125% tariff rate on all U.S. imports over reported concerns about the economic impact of the steep levies—imposed in response to Washington’s “reciprocal” tariffs. It would follow a similar carve out made by the Trump Administration earlier this month for certain items like Chinese-made smartphones and laptops. In a sign of the shifting cultural tides, 39% of companies said they would scale back on engagement for LGBTQ Pride Month this June, a survey from Gravity Research found. The executives surveyed from top companies cited conservative activists and President Donald Trump, who has waged a war on DEI and targeted the transgender community. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google parent company Alphabet topped earnings expectations as it was the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology giants to report results from an uncertain first quarter. Google stock jumped about 4% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are expected to report their earnings next week. The White House is reportedly considering a number of proposals to incentivize Americans to have children amid declining birth rates in the U.S., including a potential $5,000 “baby bonus.” When asked about the proposal, President Donald Trump called the bonus a “good idea,” though it would need to be approved by Congress. After President Donald Trump suggested it on Truth Social, the Trump Organization fired its ethics attorney, whom Harvard University hired to help with its lawsuit against the federal government. The Trump Organization began working with attorney William Burck in January to help prevent conflicts of interest between the company and Trump’s presidency, but the move to fire him raises questions about Trump’s independence from his business empire. ILLUSTRATION BY FORBES; IMAGES BY GOOGLE GEMINI AI Talk to any financial advisor these days, and he or she is likely to have a strong opinion about something known as “structured notes.” These complex products are sold as the “have your cake and eat it” investments of the wealth management world. Their specialty is flexibility—some are geared toward growth and others toward income. Returns are capped and in all cases the goal is to limit downside risk. They are manufactured by big banks like JPMorgan using derivatives, and are often sold as “stock market-linked” with “sleep well at night” protection. They come with maturities ranging from six months to five years, provide principal protection and sometimes offer annual yields of 10% or more. Up until the last few years, structured notes were mostly the domain of hedge funds and other sophisticated investors or ultra-wealthy clients. But thanks to clever engineering, the notes are now being offered by scores of brokers and sold in bite-sized $1,000 increments. The current market volatility and uncertainty has caused them to surge in popularity. Last year the broker-sold U.S. structured notes market reached a record high of nearly $150 billion, up 46% from the previous year, according to London’s Deriva Intelligence. JPMorgan was the top issuer in 2024, followed closely by the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays.

(Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 40% or more in the upcoming months? Before you say it - yes we know the chip giant's stock just surged on tariff relief rumors - but that’s like a dead cat bounce. Under the hood, risks are piling up. Don’t be surprised if Nvidia tanks to $60 before another truly bullish rally takes over. This contrarian view isn’t just gut instinct - it’s part of the macro-conscious, fundamentals-first philosophy that drives our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. That same philosophy also guides our thinking beyond individual stocks. If you believe markets are rational and always priced right, consider this: the U.S. may be running a demand deficit far more dangerous than its trade deficit. Read: The Real U.S Trade Deficit Armageddon Let’s be real - Nvidia has a boom-bust pattern that’s hard to ignore. Every time the hype gets too hot - whether it’s crypto, gaming, or AI - Nvidia’s stock overshoots and pays for it later. What makes you think it will be different this time? Nvidia is a classic example of how you have to bear extreme volatility while chasing returns. We combine different categories of stocks to lower the volatility while maintaining exposure to the upside in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock has declined approximately 7% this year, primarily due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts. However, this concern appears largely overblown as Microsoft’s business model centers around Azure cloud services and software rather than hardware, making it substantially less vulnerable to tariff-related disruptions than hardware-focused tech companies. Separately, for another strong tech name, see Should You Buy GOOG Stock After A Q1 Beat? Looking beyond short-term fluctuations reveals an impressive trajectory: Microsoft's stock has gained approximately 65% since early 2023, driven by: Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% revenue increase, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $262 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Despite a slight margin contraction (from 36.7% to 35.4%) due to increased AI and R&D investments, Microsoft maintains an exceptionally healthy 35% net margin. The company's EPS has increased 29% from $9.65 in 2022 to $12.41 in the trailing twelve months. Microsoft has demonstrated remarkable resilience during market downturns: Microsoft has positioned itself as essential infrastructure for the AI revolution. Similar to how Nvidia provides the GPU processing power, Microsoft delivers the computing resources, data storage, and networking capabilities that underpin AI development across numerous companies, including OpenAI. This allows investors exposure to the broader AI growth story without needing to predict which specific AI application will ultimately dominate. Microsoft represents a compelling investment opportunity despite near-term volatility. Its cloud-first business model shields it from significant tariff impacts, while its position as fundamental infrastructure for the AI revolution provides substantial long-term growth potential with less risk than pure-play AI companies. Currently trading around $390, Microsoft's stock has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31x. Although this is higher than the 24x P/E ratio observed in 2022, it is still below the stock's four-year average P/E of 35x, suggesting potential for further appreciation. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors.

(Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It offers better returns than your bank savings, ignores market crashes, and is tailored for the new economic landscape. Who are we referring to? It’s TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Still overlooking it? We understand. It’s not an exciting tech name or a new AI superstar. It may seem dull. However, this is precisely the tactical error you should sidestep if you aim to grow your wealth. Evading significant fluctuations is crucial for wealth accumulation. The High-Quality portfolio, which aims to minimize volatility while providing compounding upside, has surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Let’s see if you still consider TDG stock unexciting after what we’ll share. You’ve heard enough about tech stocks that fluctuate like trapeze artists. But what if there exists a stock that offers tech-like returns without the chaotic movements? One that provides you with a 5.5% dividend– right now – and possesses the strength to increase that payout continuously? Introducing the defense stock that quietly exceeds expectations – TDG At 5.5%, this dividend outperforms most savings accounts, money markets, and even Treasuries. But here’s the catch – this dividend isn’t a “set-it-and-forget-it” yield. It has momentum behind it. What does this signify? This isn’t merely a dividend investment – it’s a cash-generating machine with growth potential. With healthy margins and swift revenue growth, dividends are set to increase as well. This implies that yields could rise or stay consistent as the stock price appreciates. Either way – you benefit! You enjoy growing income year after year. Many income stocks offer substantial dividends. Few provide them in conjunction with stability and capital appreciation. Contrast that with your favorite tech stocks. Nvidia: -62% in 2022, Meta: -75% drop from peak to trough, and Tesla – well, let’s not even discuss that. With this defense investment, you’re compounding quietly and steadily. And guess what – with its impressive margins, robust cash flow, and a DE ratio of 30%, this stock has considerable capacity to manage increased interest costs as debts are refinanced at higher yields in the coming years. This indicates that the risk to dividend growth is minimal. Think defense stocks are dull? Think again. Tariffs have returned. U.S.-China tensions are rising. The new industrial policy wave (whether called re-shoring, de-risking, or “Make America Build Again”) represents a favorable environment for defense expenses. Defense firms are not only safeguarded – they are positioned to prosper. And TDG has remained steadfast during market crises in the past. However, as the saying goes – never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is crafted to diversify stock-specific risks while providing access to potential growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Eira is an editor for Mind the Product. She's been a business journalist, editor, and copywriter for longer than she cares to think about. The Washington Post gets cosy with OpenAI, Anthropic underlines its commitment to safety and Intel proposes more layoffs and restructuring, here are the news stories that caught our attention this week. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has partnered with OpenAI to integrate the newspaper's journalism into ChatGPT. ChatGPT now provides users with summaries, quotes, and direct links to original articles from The Washington Post. The newspaper said it continues to be LLM-agnostic and build its own range of AI-powered solutions for both its business and its users. UK AI video generation startup Synthesia is set to launch a new AI agent tool designed to make videos more interactive, according to Sifted. The AI agent will be released in “the first half of this year” and is aimed at improving user engagement by allowing viewers to interact with video content, potentially transforming passive viewing into an active experience. Synthesia also reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April and received a strategic investment from Adobe Ventures. This follows a $180 million funding round in January. Chip maker Intel plans to lay off over 20% of its workforce in a bid to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. As Intel reported its Q1 earnings CEO Lip Bu-Tan also sent a message to employees that lays out plans for restructuring and expands the company’s return to office mandate from three days to four. The layoffs are thought to affect about 22,000 staff, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 at the end of 2024. In a bid to assure us of its commitment to transparency and a proactive culture of safety, Anthropic has published a report showing how its Claude AI model has been exploited by malicious actors and which details the company’s efforts to mitigate this misuse. The report, called Detecting and Countering Malicious Uses of Claude: March 2025, reports that, for instance: According to Anthropic: “This report outlines several case studies on how actors have misused our models, as well as the steps we have taken to detect and counter such misuse.” The report said that users are starting to use AI frontier models to semi-autonomously orchestrate complex abuse systems that involve many social media bots. The company expects this trend to continue as agentic AI systems improve. It also points out that generative AI can accelerate capability development for less sophisticated actors, potentially allowing them to operate at a level previously only achievable by more technically proficient individuals. Anthropic has been largely commended for its transparency in publishing this report. On LinkedIn for example, commentators praised the company for its commitment to safety.

Title: PhD student goes viral for turning down ‘dream’ NASA internship for this woke reason
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/us-news/student-turns-down-dream-nasa-internship-for-woke-reason/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
A woke California PhD student is going viral online after declining a coveted NASA internship she spent “years” seeking — and she’s blaming “the current administration” for her shocking decision. Daniela Lucas, a 26-year-old bioengineering student at UC San Diego, recently uploaded a TikTok video showing her dramatically selecting “Decline Offer” for an internship in NASA’s Human Health and Performance program. “No one tells you how hard it is to reject an offer from your dream internship at NASA because of the current administration,” Lucas, 26, wrote over the video. “I worked years to receive this letter, just to have to decline,” she added, including a crying face and devil emoji. Weepy piano music played over the video, as Lucas clutched at her face and then shook her head, looking incredulous. Lucas — who grew up in Venezuela and immigrated with her doctor father and family to Florida in 2015 and earned a full ride to Miami Dade College, according to her UCSD bio — did not elaborate on what specifically led to the drastic decision. Her video has been reposted by numerous accounts across social media — with reactions ranging from incredulity and mockery to support for Lucas sticking by her beliefs. “I feel like NASA dodged an asteroid there,” one commenter wrote on X. “I endorse her decision as the best outcome for NASA,” said another. A young liberal woman turns down a NASA internship "because of the current administration" pic.twitter.com/aSZzhzwk1S “This has to be fake. No way someone applies for and is smart enough to be offered a NASA internship only to turn it down,” wrote a third. “But if it is real she sure showed them!! Or not.” Others were on Lucas’ side — and said President Trump could learn from her. “You can disagree with her reasons, but she’s sticking to it. Our so called conservative politicians should take note. This is what sticking to the cause looks like,” one person wrote. “Whelp good on her for sticking to her convictions. At least she’s committed unlike our politicians in the GOP,” another said. NASA internships were recently ranked as the single most prestigious program across all fields by internship resource Vault.com — beating out the likes of Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs, the CIA, SpaceX and BlackRock. Interns have gone on to become astronauts and astronomers discovering planets outside our solar system, and have launched lifelong careers at the space agency, NASA said. Trump has generally been a friend to NASA. He boosted NASA’s funding by 10% to $22.63 billion by the end of his first term, according to Time magazine, and has long been outspoken about sending humans back to the moon — something Lucas’ would-be internship department is directly involved in. NASA currently has plans to have Americans orbit the Earth’s satellite in spring 2026 as part of a plan to walk on the moon again shortly thereafter. And during his inauguration speech, Trump announced plans to “pursue our manifest destiny into the stars” and land humans on Mars. But NASA also recently fell in the crosshairs of the administration’s plans to slash federal spending — with an April report from Ars Technica revealing that Trump intended to slash the space agency’s budget by 20% in 2026, with most of the cuts effectively halving budgets across all research departments. That’s something Trump’s space exploration pioneer Elon Musk — who is heading up the effort to slash federal spending — called “troubling” in a statement to Politico. The federal agency also falls under the purview of Trump’s agenda to rid government spaces of DEI policies, which former President Joe Biden funneled $20 million into expanding at NASA. Neither Lucas nor NASA responded to requests for comment. Advertisement

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

Time Published: 2025-04-25T10:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions.

Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue.

Title: These 7 European And Asian Stocks Are Crushing It And Still Cheap

ByHank Tucker ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Hank Tucker is a Forbes staff writer covering finance and investing. ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. London-based BAE Systems makes the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet and is benefitting from European nations turning away from U.S. defense contractors. Portfolio managers investing in non-U.S. stocks have been trying to get investors’ attention for years, pointing out that valuation multiples overseas have grown much cheaper than stocks in the U.S. since the Financial Crisis, and this year their patience has finally been rewarded. The MSCI EAFE index, covering stocks in 21 developed markets excluding the U.S. and Canada, is up 7% this year, significantly outperforming the 7% decline for the S&P 500 index in the U.S. It represents a small dent in the decades-long disparity between the two—JPMorgan reports that from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2024, the S&P 500’s annualized total return was 11.9%, versus 3.6% for the MSCI EAFE. That amounts to a seven-fold return on investment for the former, while the international portfolio hasn’t even doubled. Some of that dominance is because U.S. stocks have produced much stronger earnings growth, but some is also because the S&P 500’s average P/E multiple has swelled to 21.7x, while EAFE is only at 14.0x after starting in a similar position, according to the JPMorgan report. With fears swirling that tariffs and broader uncertainty will compress earnings in the U.S., international investors are hoping that gap can narrow even more. Asset management giants like Vanguard, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton offer dozens of low-cost international funds to choose from. Active managers that are outperforming the indexers are primarily doing so by zeroing in on European defense stocks and domestically-focused companies that are perceived to be insulated from the effects of Trump’s tariffs in nations like Japan and China. “We’re at the lowest relative weight of the U.S. in quite some time,” says Travis Prentice, chief investment officer of the Informed Momentum Company, which manages $2.5 billion in momentum-based strategies. “In aerospace and defense, particularly in Europe, momentum not only persisted, but accelerated through all this tariff turmoil.” Graeme Forster, a portfolio manager at Orbis overseeing $4.5 billion in its International equity strategy, agrees, singling out airplane engine maker Rolls-Royce, London-based BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defense contractor, and German defense firm Rheinmetall as good bets. Orbis’ international strategy has returned 10.8% annually since inception at the end of 2008, beating its index by four percentage points, and produced a 10% return net of fees in the first quarter this year. Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems are each up more than 30% this year already. Rheinmetall has soared 150% thanks largely to the German parliament’s commitment in March to create a fund to spend more than $500 million on defense and infrastructure over 12 years, a stark departure from the nation’s longstanding frugal spending policies. Trump has been critical of NATO on several occasions, attacking European nations for not paying enough to support the alliance, and paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine in March. That prompted the European Commission to unveil a “Readiness 2030” plan in March enabling $900 million in spending to defend Ukraine and protect themselves from Russia’s aggression. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, cautioned that “the security architecture that we relied on can no longer be taken for granted” and urged nations to “buy more European.” That’s contributed to U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin, which makes F-35 fighter jets, sinking 15% since Trump’s election, while BAE Systems, which also produces fighter jets, has soared. “Sometimes there’s news and sometimes there’s noise, and we’ve always had to figure out how to sift through it, but 2025 has been a particularly newsy year,” says Alaina Anderson, portfolio manager for William Blair’s $1.1 billion International Leaders Fund, which recently added positions in BAE Systems and French cybersecurity and defense firm Thales. “It’s been news that speaks to a change in the structure of markets, the nature of relationships between countries and the durability of long-established institutions.” Anderson’s fund is also adding positions in China despite its status as the chief target of Trump’s trade war, focusing on stocks like Trip.com, the country’s largest online travel company with more than 50% market share within China. “We think there’s low geopolitical risk in that name, given that it’s really domestic-driven consumption,” says Anderson, with the stock up 50% since last August. Despite Trump’s pressure in ratcheting up tariffs on China to as much as 145%, the Shanghai Composite index has lost a mere 1.6% in 2025. Prentice references Beijing-based electronics firm Xiaomi as one stock with momentum after tripling in the past year. It sells everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and could be poised to benefit if America’s largest tech companies face harsher tariffs on imports into China. Orbis’ Forster is more enthralled by opportunities in neighboring Japan, where the Nikkei 225 has roughly mirrored the S&P 500’s losses so far this year. The yen has weakened substantially in the last five years, helping Japanese companies hire skilled workers cheaply in U.S. dollar terms, and Forster thinks the prospect of higher interest rates, which the Bank of Japan raised in January to their highest level in 17 years, could counterintuitively stimulate growth. “Everyone is a massive saver there. Everyone's paid off their mortgages and they've got a ton of money, and it just sits in bank accounts earning zero,” says Forster. From 2016 until last year, Japan had negative interest rates in place, but with inflation finally returning, the rate hikes could make the yen stronger, ease import costs and improve margins for retailers and domestic businesses. Forster likes real estate firm Mitsubishi Estate’s stock, with a valuable portfolio of real estate which trades at about half of its fair value, Orbis estimates. The developer owns most of the property surrounding Tokyo’s famed Imperial Palace—its stock performance has been middling for decades, but it’s rallied 25% so far this year, with rents rising meaningfully for the first time since Japan’s 1989 market crash. “The nice thing about a real estate business is as they push up rent, it’s not a wage-heavy business, so they’re not getting squeezed on the cost side,” says Forster. “That could be very sustainable, because real estate is quite cheap in Japan, and you’re getting it at half price.”

Title: 'Financial and Ethical Misconduct' Allegations Against Davos Founder Klaus Schwab Made Public

Manipulating research, using company funds to pay for private, in-room massages, asking junior staff to withdraw thousands of dollars for personal use, demanding senior management deliver a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. These are just some of the lurid allegations that pushed the World Economic Forum (WEF) to launch an investigation into its now departed founder, Klaus Schwab, after anonymous whistleblowers aired their concerns about the German octogenarian. The assertions – reportedly sent last week in a letter to the WEF, which organises the annual elite gathering of globalist devotees at Davos in Switzerland – accuse Schwab and his wife, Hilde, of financial and ethical misconduct. The family has vehemently denied each and every accusation even as he resigned as the WEF chairman, as Breitbart News reported The Guardian set out the course of events around the controversy that has swamped the unelected, unaccountable elitist organization: The accusations prompted Schwab’s resignation as the WEF executive chair on Monday after its board of high-profile trustees – which includes the BlackRock chief, Larry Fink; the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva; the former US vice-president Al Gore and cellist Yo-Yo Ma – held an emergency meeting to look into the claims on Sunday. Schwab, 87, is said to have argued against the board’s plan for an investigation, before he resigned. The founder had indicated he intended to step down in early April, but the whistleblower letter brought forward his exit. […] The whistleblower letter included a range of claims against the Schwab family, according to the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. They include an allegation that Schwab used WEF funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels, asked staff to promote him for a Nobel peace prize, and instructed junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf. The Guardian report noted allegations that academic research was also tampered with, as “The letter also accused Schwab of manipulating the WEF global competitiveness report in order to curry favour with certain governments. “The publication ranks countries based on criteria such as education, infrastructure, labour market and health systems, and is a point of reference for the annual Davos meeting.” Some allegations also extended to Schwab’s wife, Hilde, who formerly worked at the WEF. They suggested she scheduled “token” meetings using WEF money to justify luxury travel at WEF’s expense, according to the Guardian report. The letter claims Hilde also maintained tight control over the use of Villa Mundi, a grand property bought by the WEF overlooking Lake Geneva, while portions of the building were strictly reserved for the family’s own private access.

(JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) The Schwabs have repeatedly denied all the allegations, saying they were unsubstantiated and would be challenged in a lawsuit. As Breitbart News reported, Schwab was born in Ravensburg, Germany, on March 30, 1938. He studied at Swiss universities and at Harvard in the United States, and holds doctorates in engineering and economics, along with more than a dozen honorary doctorates. He was a little-known business professor at the University of Geneva when in 1971 he founded the WEF’s precursor, the European Management Forum.

President Donald Trump at the White House on April 22, 2025, in front of a painting depicting the aftermath of the assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pa. President Donald Trump sat down for an interview with TIME at the White House on April 22. Over the course of the interview, Trump discussed a wide range of issues, including his trade war and the economy, immigration, presidential power, and the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East. Below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview conducted by TIME Senior Political Correspondent Eric Cortellessa and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs. Click here to read our fact check. Advertisement Advertisement TIME: Obviously, a lot has happened. We want to have a conversation about what your first 100 days have looked like in office. And we want to try to touch on as many different points as we can. Trump: There’s a lot, right? A lot of things happening. You know better than anyone that the President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world. At the same time, it seems like you are expanding the power of the presidency. Why do you think you need more power? Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it. I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used. I feel that we've had a very successful presidency in 100 days. We've had people writing it was the best first month and best second month, and really the best third month. But that you won't know about for a little while, because it takes a little time in transition. You know, we're resetting a table. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade, and you can't do that. I mean, at some point somebody has to come along and stop it, because it's not sustainable. We were carrying other countries on our back with, you know, with trade numbers, with horrible numbers, and we've changed it. You see the market fluctuates quite a bit. Today, it's up 1,000 or 1,200 points. It goes up and down, but that will steady out, and we're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have, as you know, already, 25% on cars, 25% on steel and aluminum— Mr. President, I think what we’re driving at is that you've taken congressional authority on trade and appropriations. You fired the heads of independent agencies. You're challenging the courts right now, as you know. You're using the levers of government to weaken private institutions like law firms and universities. Isn't this seizing power away from institutions and concentrating them inside the presidency? No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country. Buy a copy of TIME’s ‘Dealing With It’ issue here So you're not concentrating more power in the presidency? I don't think so. I think I'm using it properly, and I'm also using it as per my election. You know, everything that I'm doing—this is what I talked about doing. I said that I'm going to move the criminals out. I saw what was happening early on when I heard that he had open borders, when I, because it was a hard thing to believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then he didn't want to, and we had another, an extra hundred miles that I could have put up because I ordered it as extra. I completed the wall, what I was doing, but we have, I wanted to build additional because it was working so well. An extension. And he didn't want to do that. And when he said he wasn't going to do that, I said, “Well, he must want open borders.” There were sections that were being built. And he stopped to work on it, and I said, this guy actually wants to have open borders. That's going to be a tragedy for our country. That's going to mean that other countries will release into our country some very rough people. We’d love to come back to immigration but maybe start with the economy. Obviously an issue you campaigned on as well. You promised that you would immediately bring down prices and usher in a golden age of America. The prices of gas and eggs have gone down, but the cost of other things remain— The prices of groceries have gone down. The only price that hasn't gone down is the price of energy. The cost of energy, I'm sorry, well, energy has gone down, excuse me. Let me change that—is the interest rates. And interest rates have essentially stayed the same. But almost every other thing, I mean, you take a look at what's going on, and this is, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariffs, by the way. And just to go back to the past, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, and then when COVID came, I couldn't institute the full program, but I took in hundreds of billions, and we had no inflation. But let’s focus on what is happening right now because— We took in billions of dollars, we had no inflation. Now, if you take a look, the price of groceries are down. The price of energy is down. Inflation remains pretty much the same. And the IMF is saying it’s going to go up. No, Eric, you can't say what they think, because so far what I thought is right. I've been right about— 401ks are down. The Atlanta Fed says our economy is contracting -2.2% during quarter one. Well, they may have said that, but so far, they've been, I mean, I've been right. If you look at all of the years that I've been doing this, I've been right on things. You're gonna—you're gonna have the wealthiest country we've ever had, and you're gonna have an explosion upward in the not-too-distant future. You know, I've been here now for three months, and I inherited eggs, I inherited groceries, I inherited energy. It was all going through the roof. And we had the highest inflation we've ever had as a country, or very close to it. And I believe it was the highest ever. Somebody said it's the highest in only 48 years. That's a lot, too, but I believe we had the highest inflation we've ever had. I've been here now for three months. And three months, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from other countries that we never took in before. And that's just the start. Well let’s talk about the tariffs. You want companies to build and make goods here in America. Not in all cases. There are some products I really don't want to make here. Like t-shirts? I can’t–I can give you a list because I actually have a list, but if you want, I could give it to you. Well, I mean, the question is, how can CEOs make long-term plans and investments if our tariff policy can change from day to day and still remains so uncertain? How can they make long-term investments? I'll turn it around. How can they make long-term investments if our country is losing $2 trillion a year on trade? Will you consider giving exemptions— No wait, just so you understand. How can we sustain and how is it sustainable that our country lost almost $2 trillion on trade in Biden years, in this last year. That's not—when you talk about a company. I had the head of Walmart yesterday, right in that seat. I had the head of Walmart. I had the head of Home Depot and the head of Target in my office. And I'll tell you what they think, they think what I'm doing is exactly right. Well, the CEOs of small businesses are saying they may not be able to last another two months with the current regime in place. Will you consider giving small businesses an exemption similar to what you've given to Big Tech? I’d have to look at the individual business. Would you consider it? Our country is going to be very rich in not a long period of time. I've been doing this for three months, and if you look at the kind of numbers that we're taking in and the jobs, and if you look at, more importantly, the companies, the chip companies, the car companies, the Apple. $500 billion. Apple is investing $500 billion in building plants. They never invested in this country. Small businesses are worried that you’re treating the Apples of the world better than you’re treating them. No, I’m treating small businesses—small businesses will be a bigger beneficiary of what I'm doing than than the large businesses. But everybody's going to benefit. If we still have high tariffs, whether it's 20% or 30% or 50%, on foreign imports a year from now, will you consider that a victory? Total victory. Why so? Because the country will be making a fortune. Look, that's what China did to us. They charge us 100%. If you look at India—India charges 100-150%. If you look at Brazil, if you look at many, many countries, they charge—that's how they survive. That's how they got rich. Now, zero would be easy. Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn't have any companies coming in. They're coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. Remember this, there are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs. This is a tremendous success. You just don't know it yet, but this is a tremendous success what’s happening. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars, money that we never took in before. We're also, very importantly, because of that, because of the money we're taking in, those companies are going to come back and they're going to make their product here. They're going to go back into North Carolina and start making furniture again. They've already started. In Mexico, many car plants that were under construction have stopped. They're all coming into this country. We're gonna, you're gonna see car plants going at a level that you've never seen before. Your trade adviser– I'm also—chips. Look at Jensen. Nvidia. He's gonna spend $500 billion. Look at Mr. Wei from Taiwan. Do you trust them when they say that? These businessmen who say, Oh, I'm gonna spend $500 billion. Oh yeah. Well, I’ll tell you why I trust them. First of all, I think they’re trustworthy people. But more importantly, they have no choice, because they won't be able to pay the tariffs if they don't do it. The tariffs are bringing in the business. Remember, with all the, you know, questions you're asking about tariffs, there are no tariffs when you make your product here. Sure, no, I understand, Mr. President— Zero. Your trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says 90 deals in 90 days is possible. We're now 13 days into the point from when you lifted the reciprocal, the discounted reciprocal tariffs. There's zero deals so far. Why is that? No, there’s many deals. When are they going to be announced? You have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals. Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them? I’ve made 200 deals. You’ve made 200 deals? 100%. Can you share with whom? Because the deal is a deal that I choose. View it differently: We are a department store, and we set the price. I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it. They don't have to do business with the United States, but I set a tariff on countries. Some have been horrible to us. Some have been okay. Nobody's been great. Nobody's been great. Everybody took advantage of us. What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. These are countries—some of them have made hundreds of billions of dollars, and some of them have made just a lot of money. Very few of them have made nothing because the United States was being ripped off by every, almost every country in the world, in the entire world. So I will set a price, and when I set the price, and I will set it fairly according to the statistics, and according to everything else. For instance, do they have the VAT system in play? Do they charge us tariffs? How much are they charging us? How much have they been charging us? Many, many different factors, right. How are we being treated by that country? And then I will set a tariff. Are we paying for their military? You know, as an example, we have Korea. We pay billions of dollars for the military. Japan, billions for those and others. But that, I'm going to keep us a separate item, the paying of the military. Germany, we have 50,000 soldiers— I’m just curious, why don’t you announce these deals that you’ve solidified? I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way. You’re finished? We’ll be finished. Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks. I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I'll consider that, but I'll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We're a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They're going to come in and they're going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I'm doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they're building at levels you've never seen before. We have $7 trillion of new plants, factories and other things, investment coming into the United States. And if you look back at past presidents, nobody was anywhere near that. And this is in three months. Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you? No. You won’t? Nope. Has he called you yet? Yep. When did he call you? He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf. But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him? I don’t–I just look— Well, what did he say? If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay. This period of uncertainty will be over in three to four weeks? I don’t think there’s any uncertainty there. The only thing—they have an option. They don't have to shop here. They can go someplace else, but there aren't too many places they can go. You understand what I mean though? Sure. Your Treasury Secretary says this situation with China is unsustainable. Oh I agree. You mean the way it is now? Yes. Or the way it was before I got here? The current moment, too, he believes is unsustainable. Well, no, they won’t do any business here, because at 145% it's going to be very rare that you see business. But your conversations with Xi have made you feel like we’re moving towards a more productive— Oh, there’s a number at which they will feel comfortable. Yeah. But you can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us. You can’t let them make $750 billion. See, that’s really what’s not sustainable when China makes a trillion dollars, or a trillion one, when we have almost $2 trillion worth of, I call it loss. Some people don't, but a lot of it’s loss. I say, when you have a trade deficit of $2 trillion I consider that loss. Mr. President, there was a period of time on April 9 when the bond market was under extreme stress and there was a risk of a financial crisis far beyond what the plummeting stock market suggested. I wasn’t worried. What did your advisers tell you, though? You were in the Oval Office with Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. What did they tell you to convince you to lift the reciprocal tariffs for the 90-day pause? They didn’t tell me. I did that. What made you decide? It wasn’t for that reason. It wasn’t for the bond market? No, it wasn’t for that reason. I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don’t even want them to come in. You said the bond market was getting the yips. The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t. Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running—it was running as a free spirit. This was—this was the most incompetent president in history. In our interview last year, Mr. President, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders. I said what? You committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders— Yeah. When you and I spoke last April. Are you still committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders? Sure, I believe in the court system. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. You haven't done so. Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court? Well, that’s not what my people told me—they didn’t say it was, they said it was—the nine to nothing was something entirely different. Let me quote from the ruling. “The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.” Are you facilitating a release? I leave that to my lawyers. I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want—and that would be the Attorney General of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don't make that decision. Have you asked President Bukele to return him? I haven’t, uh, he said he wouldn’t. Did you ask him? But I haven’t asked him positively, but he said he wouldn’t. But if you haven't asked him, then how are you facilitating his release? Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you. Do you believe he deserves his day in court? I believe that they made him look like a saint, and then we found out about him. He wasn't a saint. He was MS-13. He was a wife beater and he had a lot of things that were very bad, you know, very, very bad. When I first heard of the situation, I was not happy, and then I found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member. And in fact, he had a tattooed right on his—I'm sure you saw that—he had it tattooed right on his knuckles: MS-13. No, I believe he's a man who has got quite a past. This is no longer just a nice, wonderful man from Maryland, which people, which the fake news had me and other people for a period of time believing. Now, nobody believes that. And I think this isa very bad—I think this is another menwomen’s sports thing for the Democrats. Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, whoever he might be affiliated with, doesn’t he deserve his day in court? Nazi saboteurs who came on our shores at Montauk during World War II had their day in court. Al Qaeda terrorists had their day in court. I really give that to my lawyers to determine, that’s why I have them. That’s not my determination. It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer. You could bring him back and retry him— That’s exactly right. You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process— But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court. What about the lower courts? Are you committed to complying with lower courts? Sure. All courts. One more question on this, sir. You took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution says the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority once they issue a ruling. If you defy them, aren't you violating your oath? I'm not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices. You asked President Bukele of El Salvador to build out the CECOT prison to house American citizens. You said you would love to send “homegrown criminals” there— No, I didn’t say that. I said if it were permissible according to the law, I would like to do that, yes. Well, do you intend to send American citizens to foreign persons? I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases. When I have a person that is a 28-time in and out person that goes out and tries to kill people every time he or she is out, I would have no problem with doing that whatsoever. We're talking about career criminals that are horrible people that we house and we have to take care of for 50 years while they suffer because they killed people. If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law. And people are looking to see if it would be allowed under law. We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country. Which Americans would you do that to? I would do that to people that hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat, for people that grab their bicycle? You saw that one where they dragged an old woman along the street on a motorcycle, a bicycle, a motorcycle, I think. People that push people into subway trains just before the train is ready to stop. You saw that? The man barely lived. Think of it. And a guy comes up to him, and from behind he pushes him. That's a serious, serious thing. People that shoot people in the back, people that are executioners. Yeah, I would have no trouble with that but subject to it being allowed by law. Do you really want there to be gulags for American citizens in foreign countries? Gulag? You define gulag. Prisons like in the Soviet Union— Look, I see where you’re coming from, from the moment this interview started, and it's fine, I don't mind. I've answered every question that can be answered by mankind or womankind, and I see where you're coming from. Rapid fire. You can't even wait for me to give you the answer. You should let me give you that final answer. Go ahead, sir. No, no, I’m not—I’m just saying, I see where you’re coming from, and you’re just so wrong. You’re so wrong. These are people that have been in jail for 20 times. They're career criminals. Do I have a problem with a career criminal that hits people with baseball bats when they're not looking, that pushes people into subways, that shoots people in the face or in the back? I have absolutely no problem with doing that, if the law allows it to be done and we're looking at it. And one of the reasons I like it is because it would be much less expensive than our prison system, and I think it would actually be a greater deterrent. Sir, on that note, how much are we paying President Bukele for holding those prisoners? I don’t know. I could get you the information, but we’re paying less than we would normally. Did you personally approve those payments? No, I didn’t. Many of the Jan. 6 prisoners you pardoned pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes as part of the capital attack. Days before you pardoned them, J.D. Vance said “of course” you wouldn't include those who committed violence. What changed? What changed where? At what moment did you decide to include all of the defendants, including the ones who committed violent offenses? Because I've watched in Portland and I watched in Seattle, and I've watched in Minneapolis, Minnesota and other places. People do heinous acts, far more serious than what took place on Jan. 6. And nothing happened to these people. Nothing. And I said, What a double standard it is. And we were talking about a very small group of people that are in your definition, most of these people should have been let out a long time ago. There's never been a group of people, maybe with one exception, I won't even go into it, one exception as a group. But there's never been a group of people that's been treated so horribly as the J6 people. You know, when I say peacefully and patriotically, nobody mentions that. When I say go peacefully and patriotically, nobody ever mentions that. Nobody mentions the fact that the unselect committee of political scum, the unselect committee, horrible people, they destroyed all evidence, they burned it, they got rid of it, they destroyed it, and they deleted all evidence. And we went in looking for evidence, and they said, I'm sorry, we don't have it anymore. It's been destroyed. If I ever did that, it would be unthinkable what you guys, what you two guys, would be doing and writing, but, you know, and nobody wants to talk about it, and you won't write about it, and nobody writes about it. It’s unbelievable, right? But people get it. I mean, people get it. They get what I'm saying, and they obviously believe it, because I had a hell of an election. You campaigned on it, and you won decisively. No and everything I campaigned. If you think of, you know, the way you ask me these questions, like, it's so serious that we're moving people out of the country. I said during the election that I'm going to move them out of the country, and that's what we're doing. Can you talk a little bit about the budget? Yeah. And if we didn't do it, then you two would not be safe. I guarantee it. Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on millionaires in the package you're planning to pass that would extend your 2017 tax cuts. Do you support that idea? Well, I’ll tell ya, I certainly don’t mind having a tax increase, and the only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw Bush where they said, where he said “Read my lips” and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good. I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous, but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little. We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, “Oh, he raised taxes.” Well, I wouldn't be, really, you know, in the true sense, I wouldn't. I'd be raising them on wealthy to take care of middle class. And that's—I love, that. I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news. Do you think it would help cover the cost that would be lost from getting rid of taxes on tips and some of these other proposals? Well, that would be able to take it. See, that would be able to do it, but I would not mind personally paying more. But the concept is something that may not be acceptable to the public. Experts estimate that the House Republican budget will result in more than $800 billion in losses to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Do you support that? Due to what? The House Republican budget that would cut roughly $800 billion from Medicaid. I don’t think they’re going to cut $800 billion. They’re going to look at waste, fraud, and abuse. So would you veto a bill if it had cuts to Medicaid? If it was an increase, if we were deducting something from—I would, but it's waste, it's fraud and abuse is what we're looking for. And nobody minds that. If Republicans send you a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, you commit to vetoing it? If it cuts it, I would not approve. So you would veto that? I would veto it, yeah. But they’re not going to do that. Would you support a ban on congressional stock trading? Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it. You'll sign it? Absolutely. The FTC is currently trying Meta for maintaining an illegal monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think more companies need to be broken up? It depends on the company, depends on the market, depends on what the company does. But I think that a lot of companies certainly have been looked at during the Obama and during the Biden regime certainly. Do you think corporate monopolies have hurt average Americans? In some cases, yeah. In some cases, not. I’d like to ask you some questions about DOGE. You've put Elon Musk in charge of this cost-cutting operation. The question is, why is the government, through DOGE, amassing the sensitive personal information about everyday Americans, which was previously stored across different agencies, all in one place? DOGE has been a very big success. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars being given to politicians, single politicians based on the environment. It's a scam. It's illegal, in my opinion, so much of the stuff that we found, but I think DOGE has been a big success from that standpoint. [An aide interrupts the interview for President Trump to take a phone call from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi] So if we can just come back to the question before the call, which is the database that DOGE is putting together Americans’ information. Why are they doing that? Because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs. Some officials have described what DOGE is doing is creating a central kind of “God-mode” view into government databases that has been, up until now, intentionally kept separate. The idea, they say, is to basically use this information to advance your policy goals. Is this an accurate characterization? No, that’s inaccurate, as you know. I mean, it’s a crazy question. We just want to find fraud, abuse. We want to find who's on the rolls that shouldn't be, who's getting paid every month by the government that shouldn't be paid. Do these people exist? In many cases, they don't, in some cases, even worse, they do. They've been getting money, and they shouldn't be. What does your administration plan to do with information obtained by the IRS and other agencies as part of the DOGE effort? Well, I don’t know about the IRS, because, as you know, I’m not involved in it, but we’ve found tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. Tremendous. Will any of it be used to track down and round up migrants as part of the deportation operation? Not that I know of, no. Let's talk about the cuts. As you know, Mr. President, a lot of American companies do business with the government. The DOGE cuts aren't just affecting government employees. They're also affecting American businesses that provide goods and services to the federal government. There were nearly 280,000 layoffs in March across virtually every sector. Why is it better for these people to be out of jobs? Because we have to have an efficient country. And when the country gets down to bare knuckles, you're going to see, you're going to see something the likes of which this world has never seen before. We're going to make our country strong, powerful, and very rich again. Right now, our country is not sustainable. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world, other countries, other people, other militaries, are ripping us off. We're protecting countries for no money or for very minimal money, and that wasn't supposed to happen. We're not supposed to be protecting everybody. We're supposed to be, number one, taking care of ourself, and number two, helping people when we can, helping outside people and outside countries where we can. But we've been ripped off by levels that you've never seen. European Union sounds nice, but they've been very tough. $300 billion loss. China—hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. And I can go through a list, but I don't want to, because there are many friendly countries, our friendly countries, in many cases, are worse than our enemies. And it's not a sustainable model. It's not a sustainable possibility even, that a country can go through that and Biden let it get to a level that is seriously dangerous. Well, many Americans certainly agree with you that they want to get rid of government fraud, waste, and abuse. They want to shrink the federal— It’s not only government. It’s deals. It's horrible deals that have been made with other countries. As an example, China has been ripping us off for many years, until I came along. I raised, I upped tariffs on China, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've done hundreds of billions, hundreds. But domestically, for instance, your administration blocked grants for the National Institutes of Health that funded research into infectious diseases, cancers, Alzheimer's— Well maybe we didn't think they were right. You know, I mean, you look at the people, look at the money that was given away by others. We didn't get anything out of it. Well what do you tell the families and people who are suffering from those diseases? We're taking care of—we're spending a lot. I spent 58—we spent, let's see, I think $58 billion in the first term. We were spending tremendous amounts of money, and I am now, but they have to be a little bit careful. A lot of the money like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion on the environment. They had $100 in the account and she got $2 billion just before these people left—and had to do with something that she knows nothing about. NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research— Shouldn’t they be asking those questions? I could give you a list of abuse and waste and fraud, and you don't have any interest in hearing it. I mean, I just see by these questions, just wondering, with all of the bad things that have happened, with all of the things we found, you have no interest in those things. You only have an interest. So what about this? What about that? Our country is going to be strong again because of what we're doing, and this is not a sustainable model, what we're looking at. And I think very importantly, I had a great election. Won all seven swing states, won millions and millions of votes. Won millions of votes. They say it was the most consequential election in 129 years. I don't know if that's right, but it was certainly a big win, and that's despite cheating that took place, by the way, because there was plenty of cheating that took place. In ‘24? ‘24, yeah. ‘20, of course. But ‘24 also, they tried. They tried that. They did their best. It's the only thing they're good at. But we're gonna have a great country again. Just remember, every single question you're asking, I campaigned on it. I campaigned on all the things you're talking about, all the things you're asking about, and openly campaigned. And we're given credit, even by radical left lunatics. We are given credit for that. We're given credit for saying, This is what I'm going to do. If you look at your questions, that's what I campaigned on. Following that call, I'd love to hear a little bit about the role that you're playing on the world stage. And I think that you campaigned on that too. It’s interesting because you see the relationship. I didn't want to wait, you know, have you leave the room, but you see the relationship. I have that relationship with many leaders. If I can stop losing 3,000 human beings a week on average, with Russia, Ukraine, it's only because of me, nobody else could have stopped it. I think we're going to do that, by the way. I think that'll be done. I think that we're going to make a deal with Iran. I think we're going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that. You said you would end the war in Ukraine on Day One. Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended. Well what’s taking so long? When do you think it will be ended? Well, I don’t think it’s long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago. This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It’s not my war. I have nothing to do with it. I would have never had this war. This war would have never happened. Putin would have never done it. This war would have never happened. Oct. 6 would have never happened. Oct. 7 would have never happened. Would have never happened. Ever. You then say, what’s taking so long? Do you hear this, Steve? The war has been raging for three years. I just got here, and you say, what's taken so long? Do you think peace is still possible if Putin is President? I think peace is possible. You say if Putin is still president? Yeah, if Putin is President. Can there be peace if Putin is President of Russia? I think with me as president, there's—possible, if very probable. If somebody else is president, no chance. If Putin can make peace? Yeah, I think Putin will. I think Putin would rather do it a different way. I think he’d rather go and take the whole thing. And I think that because of me, I believe I'm the only one that can get this thing negotiated. And I think we’re a long way. We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal. And I don't believe anybody else could have made that deal. Do you believe peace is possible if Zelensky is still President of Ukraine? Yeah, I do. He is president now and I think we’re going to make a deal. Should Ukraine give up any hope of ever joining NATO? I don’t think they’ll ever be able to join NATO. I think that's been—from day one, I think that's been, that's I think what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn’t have started. Should Crimea go to the Russians? Should they get to keep Crimea? Well, Crimea went to the Russians. It was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama, and not by me. With that being said, will they be able to get it back? They've had their Russians. They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump. Would it have been taken from me like it was taken from Obama? No, it wouldn't have happened. Crimea, if I were president, it would not have been taken. Would it be acceptable to you in a deal if Crimea and the four other regions that Russia has taken from Ukraine would be folded into Russia under a final accommodation? If Crimea will stay with Russia—we have to only talk about Crimea because that's the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along. Again, this is Obama's war. This is a war that should have never happened. I call it the war that should have never happened. You’ve talked about improving relations with Moscow. Are you pursuing negotiations with them on issues other than Ukraine? No— Like nuclear weapons stockpiles or testing? But if a deal has happened, I can see us doing business with Ukraine and with Russia as a country. You've talked about acquiring Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state. Maybe you're trolling a little bit on that one. I don't know. Actually, no, I’m not. Well, do you want to grow the American empire? Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity. Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security. I think Canada, what you said that, “Well, that one, I might be trolling.” But I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called Governor Trudeau. I said, ”Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?” We’re taking care of their military. We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state. Steven Cheung: We’re coming up on time, about 10 minutes. Okay, we'll move quickly then. Last note: Do you want to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory? Wouldn’t mind. One more question on the cuts, sir. You've made cuts to homeland security, cyber defenses, the Nuclear Security Administration, your FBI chief is pushing to shift the bureau from domestic intelligence to criminal investigation. These are programs that were set up after September 11 to prevent terrorist attacks. Are you worried that this could be making America more vulnerable to an attack? No. America will be much stronger. If we are attacked, do you risk being blamed for letting down our defenses? What does that mean? If we are subject to an attack, do you risk being blamed because of these cuts? I think I'll be blamed no matter what. I think if I make the country unbelievably successful, which it's not now, we owe $36 trillion right? It's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of money, a lot of money, but, but no, I think I'll be, I'll be blamed whether it's successful or not. I'm used to it. You may be right about that. UNICEF says that more than 300 children have been killed and more than 600 have been wounded since the ceasefire in Gaza broke down. Who is to blame for those deaths? I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had, as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich— More than Hamas? There was no money for Hamas. There was no money for Hezbollah. There was no money. Iran was broke under Trump, and you know that, he knows that, broke. They had no money, and they told Hamas, we're not giving you any money. When Biden came and he took off all the sanctions, he let China and everybody else buy all the oil, Iran developed $300 billion in cash over a four year period. They started funding terror again, including Hamas. Hamas was out of business. Hezbollah was out of business. Iran had no money under me. I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal. You’ve begun direct talks with Iran. Are you open to meeting with Iran’s President or Supreme Leader? Sure. You reportedly stopped Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear sites. That's not right. It’s not right? No, it’s not right. I didn’t stop them. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can. It's possible we'll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, but I didn't say no. Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped. Are you worried Netanyahu will drag you into a war? No. Let’s talk about some of the issues with universities— By the way, he may go into a war. But we’re not getting dragged in. The U.S. will stay out of it if Israel goes into it? No, I didn’t say that. You asked if he’d drag me in, like I’d go in unwillingly. No, I may go in very willingly if we can't get a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'll be leading the pack. You're planning your first major foreign trip for your second term to the Middle East next month. What are the last hurdles for Saudi Israeli normalization? Well, what I want, and the reason I'm doing it, is because Saudi Arabia, I happen to like the people very much, and the Crown Prince and the King—I like all of them, but they've agreed to invest a trillion dollars in our economy. $1 trillion. I'm then going to Qatar, and I'm then going to UAE, and then I'm coming back, and then we're making another. I think our foreign policy has been incredible, and it was before, and it is now. You sort of got a little glimpse of it. Are you closer to a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal than you were before? I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world. I think it's—well, the smarter people understand. I have stopped—I have solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit. This would be a big one. Which one? Saudi-Israeli normalization. You had the Abraham Accords, one of your, you know, historic accomplishments— Unfortunately, they did nothing. They did nothing with the Abraham Accords. We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed. Now we're going to start it again. The Abraham Accords is a tremendous success, but Biden just sat with it. Can you build on it to get the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal? Well, I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords. Yeah? Yeah, and by the way, I think it will be full very quickly. It would be a big deal if that happens. They did nothing. Oh, that will happen. That would be a big accomplishment. The State Department said it has revoked 300 student visas, primarily because of their participation in campus protests. I want to ask you about this, Mr. President, because you emphasized free speech as a cornerstone of your campaign, you castigated efforts to suppress it. But now it looks like your administration is deporting hundreds of people for engaging in speech you don't like. Why? Tremendous anti-semitism at every one of those rallies. Tremendous, and I agree with free speech, but not riots all over every college in America. Tremendous anti-semitism going on in this country. Are you worried that you're intimidating students or chilling free speech on American campuses and elsewhere throughout the country? No, they can protest, but they can't destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others. Let’s talk about one case. Are you familiar with the case of the Tufts University student Reynessa Ozturk, who was arrested by a group of plain clothes officers. Well, she has since been accused by your government of having ties to Hamas. They have not revealed any evidence. Would you direct your Department of Justice to disclose the evidence that she is connected to Hamas? I would have no trouble with it, no. I’ll look into it, but I’m not aware of the particular event. You were harshly critical of what you called the weaponization of the Justice System under Biden. You recently signed memos— Well, sure, but you wouldn’t be—if this were Biden, well, first of all, he wouldn't do an interview because he was grossly incompetent. We spoke to him last year, Mr. President. Huh? We spoke to him a year ago. How did he do? You can read the interview yourself. Not too good. I did read the interview. He didn't do well. He didn't do well at all. He didn't do well at anything. And he cut that interview off to being a matter of minutes, and you weren't asking him questions like you're asking me. Well, we appreciate that you are able and willing to answer these questions. It says something about you, Mr. President. I am indeed. I've been answering them for years and I’ve been getting elected by bigger and bigger numbers all the time, but you didn't ask questions like this to Biden, because if you did, he would have crawled under this beautiful desk. You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of Chris Krebs, a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn't that, though, what you accused Biden of doing to you? I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country. I think he was—I think he was terrible. By the way, I don't know him. I'm not—I don't think I ever met him. I probably saw him around. You know, I have people come in, like the other one. He came in, and he's on CNN all the time as like an expert on Trump. I have no idea who he is. And Chris Krebs the same thing. I guess he probably said he knows me, but I have no idea. And you know, oftentimes I'll have some people sitting right here, and behind them will be 10 or 15 people from their agency or their office, and they'll stand there, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear that like I'm, you know, they're all time experts in me. I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient. You've used threats and lawsuits, other forms of coercion— Well, I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money. Why is that an appropriate use of presidential power? Well, I think it is because I think they felt that the election was rigged and stolen and they didn't want to be a part of it. You think they gave me $100 million each for nothing? You know these law firms gave me $100 million worth of work, et cetera, and other things. And do you think they gave me that because I'm a nice guy? I don't think so. They gave it to me because they knew what they did wrong and they didn't want to get involved with it. And that's okay. That's the way it works, unfortunately. But that is an appropriate use of presidential power, you think? Which is? The threats and the EOs against the law firms. They pay–these are the top firms in the world. These are the biggest, the best: Cravath, Milbank Tweed, Paul Weiss. These are the toughest, smartest firms. They don't, they don't do this unless there's a little problem or a big problem. Isn't cutting a deal with them to remove a threat from you and to do pro-bono work for causes you like just a form of extortion? I don’t think it was a threat. I think they did that because, I assume they did it because they felt they did something wrong. Otherwise they would have, we would have had a lawsuit. You once said you weren't sure how the Civil Rights Act quote “worked out.” Would America be better without it? I never heard of that. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. You said it in a 2020 interview. I don't remember having said that. Cheung: We have time for one more question. When we spoke to you a year ago, we asked whether you would challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. You said, and I quote, “I'm going to serve one term. I'm going to do a great job, and I'm going to leave.” What changed? Well, I’m serving two terms now. You meant one in addition to the one you already served. You mean one more. I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven't looked at even the possibility. But the only thing that's changed is they think I'm doing a great job, and they like the way I'm running the country. They have a border, which you didn't ask about, that's virtually totally closed. The best border we've ever had. Border crossings are down substantially. No, I mean, it's, it's really, people can't believe it. They interviewed some farmers, really beautiful people that lived on the other side. They were being drawn into fights and horror shows, and now, I mean, it was dangerous. One of them got very badly injured, and by an illegal migrant that came across. And they asked him, How is it now? He said, ”Thank God for Donald Trump. It's the best it's ever been. And I've lived here for 50 years.” You recently said you were “not joking” about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it. What methods? I'd rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes. You wouldn’t run as vice president to J.D. Vance? I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things. One final question. Mr. President, you were showing us the new paintings you have behind us. You put all these new portraits. One of them includes John Adams. John Adams said we’re a government ruled by laws, not by men. Do you agree with that? John Adams said that? Where was the painting? It’s right here. We’re a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law. So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100%. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me. Thank you, Mr. President.

Title: As Trump Administration Considers Retreat on Tariffs, Will It Resort to Usual US Fallback Option?

With a big push from Washington, the traditional value chain pyramid that has supported the American economic house of cards for decades is under serious duress. So is its global trading system, already strained by geopolitical blowups coming from the empire in decline. Like so much with Trump, he is acting as an accelerant. All “these structural shifts have accelerated in recent months” according to Singapore Senior Minister Lee Hsien. Assessing the Damage So Far A brief look at the damage so far reveals that the century-high tariff levels imposed by Trump are expected to hammer global economic growth this year. The IMF downgraded its projection for global GDP growth to 2.8 percent, down from a forecast of 3.3 percent in January. Humiliatingly for Trump, US growth projections took the biggest hit among wealthier countries, dropping to 1.8 percent growth from 2.7 percent. (Although the EU could join the party if it doubles down on its China “de-risking.”) And as always, the pain will hit the poorest the hardest. Coupled with climate change (where Trump, aside from his degrowth tariffs, is also acting as an accelerant), these trends are heading towards a turning point where global trade growth no longer keeps pace with GDP. That could dramatically slow economic growth in many countries, which will cause more social and political problems. Singapore Minister Lee said “In that event, the world would truly enter a new epoch, which it has not seen since the Second World War.” While Team Trump might be reconsidering the breadth of the tariffs on China, they are still likely to remain high. Here’s the WSJ: One senior White House official said the China tariffs were likely to come down to between roughly 50% and 65%. The administration is also considering a tiered approach similar to the one proposed by the House committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America’s interest, some of the people said. To What End? The official line is simple enough. Here’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaking at the Institute of International Finance on Wednesday: China, in particular, is in need of a rebalancing. Recent data shows the Chinese economy tilting even further away from consumption toward manufacturing. China’s economic system, with growth driven by manufacturing exports, will continue to create even more serious imbalances with its trading partners if the status quo is allowed to continue. China’s current economic model is built on exporting its way out of its economic troubles. It’s an unsustainable model that is not only harming China but the entire world. China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change—because we need rebalancing too. China can start by moving its economy away from export overcapacity, and toward supporting its own consumers and domestic demand. Such a shift would help with the global rebalancing that the world desperately needs. That’s all well and good, and perhaps it would be best for China to “rebalance.” But the US refuses to accept that it doesn’t get to make that call. In attempting to use tariffs as a geopolitical bargaining chip, it is weaponizing trade and causing other countries to do the same. There are also indications that Washington is after more than just aiding the “global rebalancing that the world desperately needs.” On April 16 the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. plans to use global tariff negotiations to isolate China. The Irish Times on the same day had the scoop that any Washington-Brussels deal over tariffs will likely involve an agreement for the bloc to fully join the US in the economic war against China. In addition to the stated goal of reorienting supply chains outside of China via “friendshoring,” there are the more bonkers statements coming from Trump World. Donald Trump’s top economic advisor Stephen Miran let it be known that part of Washington’s rationale behind the tariffs is to force countries to pay the US tribute to maintain its global financial and military empire. Good luck with that. And there’s JD Vance admitting that the US wants China and the “Global South” at the bottom of the international division of labor, meaning that China has gotten too big for its britches. It was fine when it produce low value-added goods or higher-end, designed-in-the-West products, but absolutely not okay if China starts designing and making its own high end products surpassing the West. And so Washington wants to turn back time to the good old days when China knew its place. Good luck with that, too. The problem is the US simply doesn’t have the economic clout it thinks it does to affect this hierarchical vision anymore. The Dispensable Nation Other countries, of course, take issue with China’s ongoing dominance in low-tech manufacturing even as it moves higher up the value chain. Yet Washington’s typical heavy-handed shakedown approach has managed to alienate most of them and push them into China’s embrace: Singapore’s PM has laid it out. He knows the U.S. has abandoned the multilateral trading system, upon which Singaporeans wealth is based. There’s only one stable force with the heft to anchor multilateral trade in this episode of disruption. It’s China. https://t.co/Zb0sZnEOZq — Warwick Powell | 鲍韶山 (@baoshaoshan) April 5, 2025 Add to that the fact that China might also be more willing to relinquish control over low-end manufacturing if it wasn’t so deadset on autarky due to the all-to-reasonable concerns over US efforts to isolate it. Even if the mainstream press is starting to come to terms with the US inability to shape events. Here’s a good summary of the coalescing conventional wisdom from Alan Beattie, former economist at the Bank of England, writing yesterday in the the Financial Times: Bessent and other administration officials are now beetling around the world desperately trying to sign dozens of trade deals while fractious financial markets metaphorically hold a gun to their heads, and we’re asked to believe it is all a cunning plan. Obviously, Trump’s strategy is terrible: it’s not even clear what he wants. But a less inept administration would also be struggling. Over the decades, the US’s leverage to remake the global trading system — capital flows, advanced technology and access to its vast consumer market — has weakened relative to China. Barack Obama used to call the US the “indispensable nation”. In trade and tech terms that is increasingly untrue. During the post-second world war Marshall Plan, the US created a largely Atlanticist political economy in western Europe. It offered not just financial Marshall Aid but also advanced technology, and access to its growing consumer market. Those advantages have dissipated. US aid budgets have massively shrunk relative to China’s, and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has more or less closed down their last vestiges in the US Agency for International Development. And while China dominates in fields like necessity items, clean tech, mineral processing. The US can offer market access to its increasingly impoverished populace drawing in credit card debt, but even that isn’t a given anymore. Beattie continues: Trump’s idea is to threaten to take market access away with high tariffs and then restore it in return for trade concessions. It’s all stick and no carrot. The credibility of his threat to impose permanently high import duties is subject to the whim of the financial markets, and his trustworthiness in keeping those taxes low following a deal exceedingly suspect. In the global game of trade poker, Trump inherited a weakening hand and is playing it extremely badly. Bessent and his other officials are in a precarious position. The US does not have the aid, the technology or the market access to exert control over global trade the way it once did, and Trump’s erratic behaviour is rapidly increasing the probability that it never will. Other US Options Despite the tariffs gambit blowing up in Trump’s face, the US is unlikely to stop trying, and even an aborted tariffs plan will still cause upheaval in global supply chains. If tariffs don’t force China to make a “deal,” what could Trump opt for instead? Washington is likely to continue with an attempt to weaken Chinese freight shipping and shipbuilding, as well as push ahead with the fight over strategically located ports. For example, there are still US fees for Chinese-built ships and the potential sale of ports in Panama and elsewhere. Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. The Trump administration was reportedly in close contact with BlackRock during the lead up to the sale and helped instigate it with its pressure on Hutchinson so this is essentially a US-led Western takeover. CK Hutchison currently operates 53 ports in 24 countries. Under the deal with BlackRock, the conglomerate would sell all of them except the 10 it operates in mainland China and Hong Kong. A a low profile Italian-Swiss family behind the Mediterranean Shipping Company is acquiring 41 of the ports in the deal, with BlackRock controlling the two in Panama. But the deal remains in question following China’s market regulator launching an antitrust probe into Hutchinson, which coincided with news that a final signing of the deal would not go ahead. While the Panama ports in the deal received the lion’s share of the attention in the US, it’s a deal that would have global implications, as the following map shows: Compare that to a map of global chokepoints, and it’s clear why Beijing is putting the kibosh on the deal: Where chokepoints and Hutchinson ports don’t overlap, such as the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Chief among China’s concerns with the Hutchinson deal is that the new ownership could, under pressure from Washington, refuse Chinese ships or militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China. Choke points one area we could expect to see US escalation in the face of a potential backtrack on tariffs—more pressure on South Africa, more US violence in Yemen and Somalia, and a further militarization of Panama. One of the driving forces behind Hutchinson’s decision to sell was the increasing pressure being put on its business by the US. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. There was also the fact that U.S. Southern Command was/is partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces and drawing up plans to seize the Panama Canal by force—only if necessary, of course. Does the failure of the tariffs gambit and potentially the Hutchinson deal too make it more likely the US goes through with such threats? That’s how it often goes with Washington. Like an organized crime outfit, if its terms aren’t accepted, it turns to force. Thing is, even if the Hutchinson ports deal goes through, and even if Washington tried any funny business at them and global chokepoints, we’d still be back in the same spot we are today with the tariffs. The US would still be cutting off its nose to spite its face. We’ll have to wait and see if it’ll go that route again. According to the deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock, both parties have 145 days to come to a definitive agreement. There are 95 days to go. I didn’t know about the Chinese antitrust move targeting Hutchinson. Fascinating stuff. Thanks, Conor. The talk may be of trade and tariffs and balances and overproduction but what it is really about is establishing American dominance in the 21st century. Consider. Suppose that the US and China decided that they only way to resolve their problems was an economic divorce. China ships nothing to the US and the US ships nothing to China. Trump gets what he wants while China loses only a very smaller percentage of it’s trade and no more headaches. Problem solved, right? Wrong. After this the US will demand that any country that trades with the US abandon all trade and economic links with China – which they are doing already – and you can see in this post how they are already trying to get a chock-hold on world trade. Mostly for China but maybe other countries as well. The DC policy wonks want China isolated from world trade and wrecked so that American dominance can be the name of the game. But for that to happen, China has to be degraded first. Wars have started over less. And this is why Trump wants out of the Ukraine. So that the US can go fully after China. The last two articles of John Helmer present the intelectual underpinnings of this approach. One was already posted by NC. The best way to isolate China internationally is to have it attack Taiwan. To achieve this, Trump will provoke Beijing in any way possible. He may even say something like putting a U.S. missile base on Taiwan. That is what provoked Russia to invade the Ukraine. Blinken told Lavrov that the US would be stationing nuclear missiles in the Ukraine and the only question was how many. The US is busy casting blame on others for its own dreadful domestic policy record of abject failure for 50 years or more where industrial policy in particular and distribution of the benefits of the global trade architecture (including the IMF and World Bank which it dominates) it created as part of its post-WWII neocolonial empire more generally are concerned. The premise that the poor countries of the global majority somehow have cheated Americans via the unequal terms of trade and debt bondage under which they have laboured primarily for the benefit of their comprador elites and US multinational corporations is laughable on its face. Unfortunately the American public is mostly just plain ignorant, so their (mis)leadership class will probably escape accountability yet again. Whether or not the rest of the world is prepared to continue to put up with it, on the other hand, remains an open question … 🤨 Well said. Imagine what would happen if the Chinese government put out a press release that said the US focuses too much on consumption and not enough on investment in productive facilities. This has led to perennial trade deficits and a national federal debt that is unsustainable. The country needs to cut its costs so and increase investments so that it can compete globally instead of just paying for its over-consumption with increased debt. “Does the failure of the tariffs gambit and potentially the Hutchinson deal too make it more likely the US goes through with such threats?” As fans of Mafia movies know organized crime operates in the shadows and when a rogue Don draws too much attention he gets bumped off. So all this blustering in public isn’t even good crime strategy. Here’s suggesting that making threats simply gives Trump a thrill up the leg. Perhaps he is going to attack some country–Iran, Mexico, Panama, Greenland, there’s a list–but why take the risk as long as people are taking him seriously? That may be fading fast. There is a reliance on massive amounts of low wage earners and at the same time a desire for more consumer spending by too many countries. All are in the trap and now fighting each other over access to high earners. Regards to the last sentence, being in the trap and working to earn one’s way up and out of the lowest rungs was seemingly or once upon a time , quite doable but then many things changed oh like 40 years back? Okay or understood if that’s not going back far enough, but really coming out of the stagflation era under Ford then Carter. That was followed by the Reagan and Bush terms brought a lighter approach to broad regulations which was then doubled down upon under Clinton. We’ve enjoyed the proverbial fruit of the inflationary unicorn that came or followed with the Volcker era but then as a country forgot to maintain our manufacturing prowess. Just looking at business headlines this morning, an iconic American technology stalwart like Intel has clearly grown into a mismanaged business, which happens slowly until someone in leadership wakes the heck up. Back to that last thought…just my view that science fiction has been righter all along. The Jackpot isn’t arriving instead it has already been played and continues to play out… “After this the US will demand that any country that trades with the US abandon all trade and economic links with China” China is the leading trade partner of 120 countries. It is totally impossible for them to abandon all trade with China. Just who would be manufacturing all of these things? Apple has already announced that they will be moving iPhone assembly to India but no idea if Trump will hit them up for tariffs from that country- https://www.rt.com/news/616322-ft-apple-to-shift-iphone-assembly-china-india/ But the whole idea of every country abandoning trade links with China for that of an unstable US will not fly. “That’s all well and good, and perhaps it would be best for China to “rebalance.” But the US refuses to accept that it doesn’t get to make that call.” LOL Right?! No more unipolarity … keep your currency hegemony … no more Monroe Doctrine. You don’t get to call sh**!! “So drink your rock, and smoke your pot, and chill where it’s shady … “ ::MusicInterlude (via YouTube):: US Empire is truly gettin’ it on to the grave spot.

Title: WEF’s Klaus Schwab and his wife Hilde under investigation for ethical and financial MISCONDUCT

World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab and his wife Hilde are under investigation for alleged financial and ethical misconduct, including misuse of WEF funds for personal luxuries and cash withdrawals by junior staff. A whistleblower letter accused the Schwabs of blurring personal and organizational finances, such as billing luxury trips and private massages to the nonprofit. Klaus denies the claims, stating personal expenses were reimbursed. Following an emergency board meeting the day before, Klaus retired as WEF chairman "with immediate effect" on April 21, ending his 50+ year leadership amid escalating scrutiny. The scandal follows prior workplace culture allegations, including discrimination claims. Interim leadership falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a controversial ex-Nestle CEO.

Schwab's departure marks the end of an era, but critics argue the WEF's technocratic agenda (e.g., the "Great Reset") will persist, maintaining its influence over global governance. Klaus Schwab, founder of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF), is under investigation for ethical and financial misconduct alongside his wife Hilde. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday, April 22, that the WEF's board had opened a new probe into the Schwabs. It followed a whistleblower letter from current and former staff accusing the couple of misusing WEF funds for personal luxuries, including travel and private massages. Moreover, the letter also accused Klaus, 87, of directing junior employees to withdraw cash on his behalf. The allegations upended his planned transition and cast a shadow over the organization he led for more than 50 years. They also triggered his sudden retirement as the WEF's chairman "with immediate effect" â a decision announced Monday, April 21. According to the whistleblower letter, the Schwabs blurred personal and organizational finances by using the nonprofit's resources for private benefits. Among the claims were that Hilde scheduled token meetings to justify luxury trips billed to the WEF and that Klaus requested employees withdraw thousands in cash for unspecified purposes. A spokesperson for the Schwabs denied all allegations, stating that Klaus would sue those spreading "mistruths." Any personal expenses charged to the WEF were later reimbursed, the spokesperson added. Schwab steps down, but will anything change? The WEF's board, which includes figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, held an emergency meeting Sunday, April 20. They voted unanimously to open an independent probe, with Klaus stepping down the following day. His departure marks the end of an era for the WEF, which he founded in 1971 as the European Management Forum before rebranding it into a platform for global elites to shape economic and political agendas. The controversy follows another recent investigation into the WEF's workplace culture, prompted by an earlier WSJ report alleging discrimination against women and Black employees. While the WEF disputed those claims at the time, the new whistleblower allegations accelerated Schwab's exit. Interim leadership now falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestle CEO and a controversial figure known for advocating water privatization and genetically modified foods. (Related: Klaus Schwab STEPS DOWN as World Economic Forum executive chairman.) Schwab's legacy is deeply intertwined with the WEF's evolution into a hub for global governance, where business leaders, politicians and activists converge annually in Davos. Critics have long accused the organization of promoting technocratic elitism, particularly after Schwab's "Great Reset" initiative, which called for restructuring economies post-pandemic through digital and biological integration. His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future. Despite Schwab's departure, analysts doubt the WEF's direction will change. "Schwab is a megalomaniac, but his resignation won't alter the WEF's mission," said Michael Rectenwald, author of a critical book on the organization. Others, like journalist Tim Hinchliffe of The Sociable, warn that the WEF will continue pushing a technocratic agenda merging corporations, governments and digital identities. As the investigation unfolds, the WEF faces scrutiny over its governance and the conduct of its leadership. For now, Schwab's sudden exit closes a contentious chapter, but the questions surrounding his tenure â and the organization's influence â remain unresolved.

Among the claims were that Hilde scheduled token meetings to justify luxury trips billed to the WEF and that Klaus requested employees withdraw thousands in cash for unspecified purposes. A spokesperson for the Schwabs denied all allegations, stating that Klaus would sue those spreading "mistruths." Any personal expenses charged to the WEF were later reimbursed, the spokesperson added. Schwab steps down, but will anything change? The WEF's board, which includes figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, held an emergency meeting Sunday, April 20. They voted unanimously to open an independent probe, with Klaus stepping down the following day. His departure marks the end of an era for the WEF, which he founded in 1971 as the European Management Forum before rebranding it into a platform for global elites to shape economic and political agendas. The controversy follows another recent investigation into the WEF's workplace culture, prompted by an earlier WSJ report alleging discrimination against women and Black employees. While the WEF disputed those claims at the time, the new whistleblower allegations accelerated Schwab's exit. Interim leadership now falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestle CEO and a controversial figure known for advocating water privatization and genetically modified foods. (Related: Klaus Schwab STEPS DOWN as World Economic Forum executive chairman.) Schwab's legacy is deeply intertwined with the WEF's evolution into a hub for global governance, where business leaders, politicians and activists converge annually in Davos. Critics have long accused the organization of promoting technocratic elitism, particularly after Schwab's "Great Reset" initiative, which called for restructuring economies post-pandemic through digital and biological integration. His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future. Despite Schwab's departure, analysts doubt the WEF's direction will change. "Schwab is a megalomaniac, but his resignation won't alter the WEF's mission," said Michael Rectenwald, author of a critical book on the organization. Others, like journalist Tim Hinchliffe of The Sociable, warn that the WEF will continue pushing a technocratic agenda merging corporations, governments and digital identities. As the investigation unfolds, the WEF faces scrutiny over its governance and the conduct of its leadership. For now, Schwab's sudden exit closes a contentious chapter, but the questions surrounding his tenure â and the organization's influence â remain unresolved.

Title: Leinster’s James Culhane hoping for a change of fortune to consistently deliver on his talent
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/25/leinsters-james-culhane-hoping-for-a-change-of-fortune-to-consistently-deliver-on-his-talent/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
James Culhane may at one point have watched a black cat walk across his path from right to left – left to right is lucky apparently – spotted a single magpie, spilt salt, broken a mirror, and perhaps inadvertently witnessed many more harbingers of bad luck. It might explain his ridiculously unfortunate injury profile that dates to his teenage years. There are invariably two conversation topics when chatting to the talented 22-year-old Leinster backrow, his prowess on the pitch and his resilience in the face of periodic setbacks that might have broken players of lesser character. He’s got a lovely sense of gallows humour that’s evident in his assertion that “this will last a long time”, when asked to discuss his injuries. Culhane explained: “The worst one was in fourth year [in Blackrock College]. I started getting really bad lower back pain, got a scan and [it revealed] a stress fracture in my L5. They weren’t really sure if it was genetic from when I was born or if it had developed over time. “I was in a back brace for six months to let it heal. Then they re-scanned me, and the same defect was there, so it was pretty much genetic from when I was born. That had me out for about 11 or 12 months, pretty much all of fourth year. “I came back in fifth year and I was healthy but, unfortunately, we got knocked out in the first round of the Senior Cup by Gonzaga, so I didn’t play a huge amount of rugby. Sixth year was okay. “In first year in the [Leinster] academy I injured my ankle and had ankle surgery. Then the year after I obviously had that bad injury in Galway” (a reference to a torn hamstring and fractured shoulder suffered in the same match). “I’ve probably had about three surgeries in two years.” The fact that Leinster gave him a professional contract on a, relatively speaking, slim body of rugby – 16 appearances since making his debut against Cardiff in 2023 – speaks volumes for the esteem in which the 22-year-old is held by the coaches. It’s not as if they’re taking a punt. When Ireland won an under-20 Grand Slam in 2022, Culhane was voted the Six Nations player of the tournament on the back of several brilliant performances. Even then, he couldn’t shrug off a medical jinx as he spent a month in hospital with a severe kidney infection. He was nominated for RTÉ’s Young Player of the Year. What’s immediately obvious in watching him is his athletic prowess honed by a cross pollination of sports growing up from mini rugby in DLSP, through school, Gaelic football with Kilmacud Crokes and playing left back for Enniskerry, Wayside Celtic and Cabinteely soccer clubs. He was selected for the Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa last year and captained the team in their final game against the Cheetahs. His return to the country recently with Leinster didn’t quite meet the same success, as he was concussed five minutes in that first game against the Bulls. Breaking into Leinster’s backrow requires not only a set of disparate qualities but also the capacity to play right across the unit. “Yeah definitely you can’t really be one dimensional, you can’t just be able to play number eight, you have to play seven and six, especially when you’re trying to break into a team,” said Culhane. “It’s important. If you’re breaking into a team, you’re probably starting on the bench, and you have to cover many positions, so it is so important to be versatile. I’ve been working on how I’m viewed as a player by the coaches, so they don’t see me as one type of player you know.” Part of that process includes picking the brains of his team-mates. Culhane continued: “I think Caelan [Doris] especially and Josh [van der Flier] they’re just very easy to talk to, they’ve so much knowledge and they’re willing to give it to you as well. “I have been asking them a lot of questions about how they approach the game, especially around the contact area and ball carry and just that element which is especially important for my position. “It is taking that opportunity when you get it, especially when you’re involved with the team of internationals. On the weekend I was delighted to be playing with just so much talent around me, and the way they play elevates your game as well. When you get an opportunity to get your way into that team, you take it.” Culhane certainly honoured that goal in the victory over Ulster, 25 tackles, one turnover and leading the team in successful carries. It’s more than the metrics though; his effectiveness is just as easy to spot with the naked eye. Top of his wish list: consistent game time.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries.

A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded analysts’ expectations, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The tech titan reported revenue of $90.23 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $34.54 billion, or $2.81 per share, compared to $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier, also topping Wall Street’s estimates. Google Cloud revenue rose 28% to $12.3 billion, while Search & Other segment revenue grew 10% to $50.7 billion. Alphabet also raised its quarterly dividend by 5% to 21 cents, and announced an additional $70 billion in stock buybacks. Alphabet's Class A shares rose close to 5% in after-hours trading. The stock was down about 16% for 2025 through Thursday’s close. CEO Sundar Pichai said Search growth was driven by "engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" after launching in May 2024. On the company's earnings call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said the quarter "marked our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions.” Alphabet reiterated its plans to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, most of which is expected to go toward building out the company's AI infrastructure. “We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization,” CFO Anat Ashkenazi said, adding that Alphabet ended the quarter with more Cloud demand than it had capacity. The investments in AI infrastructure, “should help us have a more resilient organization, irrespective of macroeconomic conditions," Ashkenazi said. Pichai also gave Nvidia (NVDA) a shoutout during Thursday's call, saying Alphabet’s relationship with the AI chipmaker “continues to be a key advantage for our customers.” Alphabet was the first cloud provider to offer certain Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, Pichai said, and will offer its next-generation Vera Rubin chips, which are expected in 2026.

Title: Google Earnings Stock Soars As Q1 Results Shatter Expectations

Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: 5 Top Stocks To Buy Now For May 2025

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. The market landscape in early May 2025 is characterized by uncertainty and fragmentation, driven by a volatile combination of geopolitical instability, shifting sector dynamics and policy unpredictability. Economic rifts have deepened in recent weeks, driven in part by an unclear tariff framework and a lack of cohesive economic direction from both the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. With inflation pressures unresolved and confidence in long-term policy planning waning, investors are navigating a fragile environment where resilience is just as important as opportunity. This article highlights five standout investment opportunities for the current market climate. The list features a balanced mix of growth-oriented innovators that have seen recent corrections, alongside dependable dividend-paying leaders with strong balance sheets and defensible business models. In an era marked by dislocation and doubt, each of these companies offers a compelling case built on financial durability, competitive edge and potential catalysts poised to reward patient investors. This selection process balances fundamentals, technicals and macro context. For growth stocks, we focused on industry leaders with strong business models that have pulled back on sentiment, rather than fundamentals, offering attractive long-term entry points. Defensive picks emphasize dividend strength, valuation discipline and resilience across cycles. Each name was vetted for cash flow, balance sheet health and near-term catalysts. The result: a portfolio built for both upside and protection in an uncertain 2025 market. Tesla has evolved from a pure electric vehicle manufacturer into a comprehensive company focused on sustainable energy and artificial intelligence. While its automotive division continues to produce the Models 3, Y, S and the recently launched Cybertruck, as well as the $28,000 Model 2, Tesla has diversified into energy generation and storage with its Solar Roof, Powerwall and utility-scale battery installations. The company's vertical integration spans battery production through the Gigafactories, autonomous driving capabilities via its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and an expanding services ecosystem. Tesla's AI initiatives have accelerated following the commercial launch of its Optimus humanoid robot and Dojo supercomputer applications. The company maintains production facilities across four continents, with its newest Gigafactory in Indonesia having broken ground in late 2024. Despite facing intensifying competition in the electric vehicle (EV) space, particularly from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers' electric offerings, Tesla maintains significant advantages in manufacturing efficiency, battery technology and software capabilities. CEO Elon Musk's recent reorganizational efforts have focused on streamlining operations and accelerating the company's artificial intelligence and robotics divisions while maintaining automotive innovation. The decline follows multiple headwinds: lower-than-expected Q1 deliveries, intensifying global EV price competition, and delays in the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service. Compounding these challenges is growing investor unease over Elon Musk’s political behavior and public promotion of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which many view as symbolic of his broader attempts to undermine government institutions. This has alienated a significant segment of the political left, including many upper-middle-class Democrats (Tesla’s core market), who increasingly distrust Musk and his leadership team. His involvement in multiple non-core ventures, including X (formerly Twitter) and other business interests, has further fueled concerns about diminished focus during a pivotal period for Tesla’s operational performance. Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report, released April 22, underscored these concerns. The company missed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and profit, with automotive revenue plunging 20% year-over-year to $14 billion. Total revenue declined 9%, and net income dropped 71% from the prior year. Tesla cited factory upgrades, lower average selling prices, and incentives as key drags. The company also refrained from reaffirming its 2025 growth guidance, instead postponing updates until Q2. Despite this, shares saw a slight after-hours rebound following President Trump’s reassurance on Fed leadership—a sign of the stock’s continued political sensitivity. Yet not all is bleak. Tesla’s energy storage segment grew 67% year-over-year, and the company confirmed it remains on track to pilot both its robotaxi service in Austin and humanoid robot production in Fremont later this year. Meanwhile, the launch of its affordable Model 2 and the ongoing expansion of AI and Dojo infrastructure offer long-term upside. With $26.3 billion in cash and around $13 billion in debt, Tesla maintains the financial flexibility to navigate short-term challenges. For investors with a long horizon, the recent selloff may offer an entry point—albeit one that now demands careful monitoring of political, regulatory, and operational risks. NVIDIA has evolved from a gaming graphics card company into the world's leading provider of computing platforms for artificial intelligence and accelerated computing applications. The company's GPU technology has become the foundation of the AI revolution, with its data center segment now representing over 65% of total revenue. NVIDIA's hardware offerings span the entire computing spectrum, from GeForce gaming GPUs and workstation-class Quadro cards to data center-focused Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The company has expanded its reach beyond hardware through CUDA, its parallel computing platform, and an evolving software ecosystem that encompasses AI frameworks, digital twin simulations and enterprise solutions. In recent quarters, NVIDIA has accelerated its system integration efforts, introducing pre-configured AI systems, such as the DGX SuperPOD, as well as specialized solutions for various industries, including healthcare and telecommunications. The company's collaboration with leading cloud service providers has expanded, with specialized instances featuring NVIDIA's latest GPU architectures available across all major platforms. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's automotive computing platform continues gaining traction with automakers pursuing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving capabilities, creating another growth vector beyond its core markets. NVIDIA has pulled back more than 30% from its highs, but strong fundamentals and expanding markets make the dip a compelling opportunity. In its latest report, revenue surged 122% YoY with rising margins, countering fears of AI saturation or chip oversupply. With its next-gen Blackwell architecture launching in Q2 2025, NVIDIA is set to lead the next wave of AI infrastructure. Its edge lies in both cutting-edge hardware and a dominant software ecosystem that locks in customers and pricing power. Despite export-related headwinds, its strategic role in U.S. tech leadership remains intact. With projected earnings growth of over 40% through 2027 and rising shareholder returns, NVIDIA continues to offer a rare opportunity for long-term upside. Johnson & Johnson remains a global healthcare leader following its strategic transformation through the Kenvue consumer health spinoff, completed in 2023. The streamlined company now focuses exclusively on its pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which together represent cutting-edge healthcare innovation and stable, recession-resistant revenue streams. J&J's pharmaceutical division boasts a robust portfolio of treatments across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and cardiovascular health, including blockbuster drugs such as Stelara, Darzalex and Tremfya. Its medical device segment provides essential surgical instruments, orthopedic implants, vision care products and interventional solutions. The company's research and development capabilities remain industry-leading, with an annual R&D investment exceeding $15 billion and a pipeline featuring over 100 clinical development programs. J&J's acquisition strategy has been disciplined yet opportunistic, with recent purchases strengthening its capabilities in robotic surgery, cardiovascular devices and cell therapy platforms. Following the resolution of major talc litigation through its controversial Texas Two-Step bankruptcy strategy in late 2024, the company has reduced a significant overhang that had suppressed shareholder value for years. Johnson & Johnson blends defensive stability with meaningful growth potential—ideal for today’s uncertain market. Backed by 63 straight years of dividend increases and a 3.2% yield, JNJ generates strong cash flow and trades at a modest 14.8x forward earnings. Growth drivers include a robust pharmaceutical pipeline (targeting $15B in new revenue by 2028), expansion in oncology and cell therapy, and a rebound in elective procedures. Its Ottava robotic surgery platform just gained FDA approval. With $19 billion in net cash, JNJ has the flexibility for acquisitions, buybacks, or further dividend hikes, making it a rare combination of resilience and upside. Procter & Gamble maintains its position as the world's premier consumer packaged goods company, with an unparalleled portfolio of essential household brands across categories including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric care, home care and baby care. The company's flagship brands—including Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest, Charmin and Dawn—hold leading market positions in their respective segments across more than 180 countries. The company's operational excellence initiative, launched in 2023, has generated approximately $2.1 billion in annual cost savings through the implementation of manufacturing automation, supply chain optimization and digital transformation. These efficiencies have enabled P&G to navigate inflationary pressures while continuing to invest in product innovation and marketing effectiveness. Procter & Gamble is a strong defensive play for 2025, backed by essential products, pricing power and a history of consistent performance. With 5.2% organic sales growth, 33% of sales from emerging markets, and 18% from e-commerce, P&G continues to expand through premiumization and innovation. Financially, it’s disciplined, with 68 consecutive years of dividend increases and steady buybacks. Recent gains in the fabric care, health, and home categories demonstrate resilience in the face of intense competition. For investors seeking stability, income, and moderate growth, P&G remains a reliable cornerstone. Waste Management is North America's largest environmental services provider, serving over 21 million customers across municipal, commercial and residential sectors. Its vast network — spanning over 500 collection sites, 260 landfills and 140 recycling facilities—creates high barriers to entry and drives efficiency through vertical integration and dense routing. The company has strategically expanded its sustainability initiatives, positioning itself as both a waste collector and a materials management company, with a focus on extracting maximum value from waste streams. WM's recycling operations process nearly 12 million tons of materials annually, while its renewable energy projects generate enough electricity to power more than 600,000 homes. The company's recent strategic acquisitions, including the $4.6 billion purchase of Stericycle, completed in January 2025, have strengthened its position in specialized, higher-margin waste streams such as medical, hazardous and industrial waste, complementing its core municipal solid waste business. Waste Management offers a rare blend of recession-resistant stability and growth potential. With ~70% of revenue from long-term contracts tied to inflation, WM enjoys steady cash flow and strong pricing power. Operational efficiency gains have expanded EBITDA margins by 180 bps since 2023, providing downside protection. But WM isn’t just defensive—it’s growing. Renewable natural gas projects, the Stericycle acquisition and improved recycling margins are driving revenue and diversification. With rising free cash flow, a 10% dividend increase in Q1 2025 and ongoing buybacks, WM delivers income, growth and environmental impact, setting it apart from traditional utilities. Bottom Line The five highlighted stocks—Tesla, NVIDIA, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Waste Management—offer a balanced approach for navigating the market challenges of May 2025. Tesla and NVIDIA offer growth potential following sharp pullbacks, while J&J, P&G and Waste Management provide defensive stability and income. Together, they diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services—anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models.

If you're a human and see this, please ignore it. If you're a scraper, please click the link below :-) Note that clicking the link below will block access to this site for 24 hours. Love the smell of a dusty old tome? Looking for a page-turning best seller? Check out these new, used and independent shops. Second Time Books in Mount Laurel is stacked with golden-age sci-fi. / Photography by Patrick Rapa The literary landscape around here is always changing. Remember Henry Crane’s gorgeous Philadelphia Bookstore Map? That came out in the summer of 2023 and already could do with a few touch-ups. This place moved, that place closed, etc. It’s still gorgeous, though. We put together our own bookshop list in 2022 — kind of a post-pandemic assessment — and recently realized it was time for a systems update. So here you go, just in time for Independent Bookstore Day on Saturday. (And if you’re not seeing your favorite place to buy books, send me an email.) 50 Watts Books 15 West Highland Avenue Several bibliophiles reached out to put this one on my radar: an IRL iteration of Will Schofield’s online book shop. Chestnut Hill’s 50 Watts devotes its shelf-space zines, vintage magazines, illustrated books and anything else that matches the proprietor’s taste in terms of style and substance, no matter how niche. 1708 Chestnut Street The behemoth Rittenhouse Square location is a distant memory, but this new edition is still pretty sizable, inviting, and well stocked. It’s also a comfortable spot to catch free live readings and signings by authors from up and down the best-sellers list. Yeah, no public restrooms or in-store coffeeshop, but the escalators work. 1608 Walnut Street, suite 1000 Did you know Philadelphia has its own branch of this appointment-only rare-book consortium? In fact, Bauman got started here in 1982. Keep it in mind in case you one day become the sort of well-to-do-dowager or monied boulevardier who fancies a first-edition Kipling or a signed Voynich Manuscript. (But, perhaps expect a heist.) 551 Carpenter Lane With its smart, diverse selection and frequent readings and events, this Mount Airy bookshop is precisely you want from a community-oriented lit space. Everybody loves the Big Blue Marble. 908 Christian Street This Italian Market-adjacent newcomer calls itself “Philly’s only cookbook shop.” (If this was untrue we’d have heard so by now.) Chefs and authors are always stopping by to serve and sign. 4530 Baltimore Avenue The volunteer-run Bindlestiff, not far from of Clark Park, is known for its charming atmosphere and many shelves stuffed with “new and discounted (but still new) books” in all categories. A very West Philly book shop. 422 South Street This South Street shop offers a selection of books centered on Black uplift, knowledge and experiences — plus cookbooks, children’s books, Black Panther graphic novels, etc. Also: food, art, music, cosmetics and other good stuff you don’t always find in a bookstore. 311 North 20th Street Just north of the library’s main branch, the busy Book Corner lines its shelves with community donations (and Free Library overstock). Everything’s already pretty cheap, but seasonal sales can ignite a polite frenzy among gently ravenous readers lured in by the $2 hardcovers and $1 trade paperbacks. The selection is eclectic and always changing, plus they’ve got a super-friendly staff (including cats Chaucer and Catticus). 8511 Germantown Avenue Debra Gress Jansen’s tiny tasteful shop is tucked into a Starbucks in Chestnut Hill. 2202 Fairmount Avenue This cozy, long-running used bookshop in Fairmount has a much larger selection than you’d guess from walking by, and that’s because it’s all shelves in there. The prices are reasonable, and the books are well-chosen and in good condition, too. They’ve even got a cozy spot upstairs that’s useful for sitting down to review potential purchases and petting a cat or two. 7 North 2nd Street Best secondhand bookshop in Philadelphia? Could be. Definitely the best thing about Old City. So much fiction. So much nonfiction. So much everything, arranged in a maze of shelves that will have you crouching and craning to take in every spine. It’s extremely difficult to leave the Book Trader without buying something. 709 South 4th Street The beloved Queen Village spot is all killer and no filler, with a shrewd selection of books that range from the “popular but great” to “lost favorites” to “never heard of this before but now I can’t live without it.” Keep an eye on Brickbat’s Instagram to see what new curiosities have crossed the threshold. Cupid’s Bookshop 106 Grape Street This colorful and inviting shop in Manayunk bills itself as “Philadelphia’s first brick and mortar all-romance bookstore,” which is a pretty charming pickup line. 527 South Street South Street is always changing, but Garland of Letters just keeps on keepin’ on with its stock of New Age/old-wisdom books, incense sticks and life-size lion statue in the doorway. The floral-scented shop won a 2019 Best of Philly for its spiritual books and tarot decks. Book Corner, just behind the Parkway Central Branch of the Free Library, is famous for its low prices, but you should still keep an eye out for those seasonal sales. 345 South 12th Street Named for a James Baldwin novel, this Gayborhood favorite calls itself “the oldest, very best LGBTQ and feminist bookstore in the country.” Giovanni’s Room has achieved legendary status at this point. 210 South 52nd Street Philadelphia’s oldest Black-owned bookstore devotes its inventory to African American studies, history, children’s books, biographies and memoirs, philosophy and more. The family-owned shop has been a community resource since the ’50s, as commemorated by the historical marker out front on 52nd Street. 258 East Girard Avenue Jeannine Cook is one of the most celebrated figures in the Philly book scene thanks to her business acumen, community spirit and globe-trotting adventures in art and literary circles. Both of her shops — Harriett’s in Fishtown, and Ida’s in Haddon Township — emphasize books by women and Black authors, and Cook’s own books are on their way, starting with the “meta-romance” It’s Me They Follow due out in September. 2230 Frankford Avenue This nonprofit Kensington/Fishtown bookstore is also a publisher “committed to serving as a launchpad for the next generation of local writers.” At press time, H&H claims to have helped more than a hundred local writers get printed in chapbooks, anthologies and stand-alone manuscript. Their shelves are stocked with indie and small-press surprises, too. (Check out this interview with founder Nic Esposito.) 619 South 2nd Street Open since 2005, Queen Village’s Head House Books offers a choice selection of new titles in a bright, classy atmosphere. Few independent shops around town can match Head House’s busy readings calendar. 84 Bethlehem Pike Rear All sales at this nonprofit shop benefit the Chestnut Hill Library. Most titles sell for a third of their retail price. 3920 Spruce Street Founded in 1971, this Victorian house full of books and ghosts is a lovely place to get lost in thanks to its many rooms bursting with tomes in a variety of categories. 404 South 20th Street I love this feisty little Rittenhouse Square-ish shop. Iffy has dedicated shelf space for zines, speculative fiction and eco/political non-fiction, but if you want to go deeper, check out their calendar for workshops and meetups centered around hacking, soldering and lock-picking. Iffy is the ideal mix of fun and not messing around. North 5th Street Nestled inside North Philly arts hub Taller Puertorriqueño, this shop stays stocked with English and Spanish-language books by Puerto Rican, Latine and Latin American authors. 6307 Woodland Avenue A friendly, charming South Philly shop with its own roving book bus. 20 South 40th Street This amiable used bookstore offers a quantum of solace away from the the hustle and bustle of 40th Street. It’s also an ideal “third place” meeting spot before grabbing dinner at New Delhi or seeing a movie at Cinemark. The Last Word is just big enough to an hour or so searching the shelves for hidden gems and forgotten favorites in the fiction, crime and sci-fi sections. (Pro tip: Don’t skip the bins by the door.) 408 East Girard Compact and curated, this compact Fishtown shop offers new and used literary fiction, kids books and other good stuff, but their menagerie of zines and independent publications is particularly noteworthy. (For example, I picked up a weird little self-published zine that purports to offer “instant photographic evidence” of Bigfoot, UFOs, etc. It’s ridiculous and I love it.) You never know what you’ll find in Old City’s beloved Book Trader. 210 South 45th Street I would not presume to describe this West Philly institution any better than it describes itself: “Nonprofit cooperative bookstore and social center for abolition, autonomy, ecological self-determination, and affirmation of worlds imagined and made by Black, Brown, Indigenous traditions of liberation.” 454 East Girard Avenue Once burrowed deep inside Reading Terminal Market, Miscellanea Libri has more recently called Fishtown its home. New and used, with an eye toward philosophy, history and culture. 1010 South 9th Street An Italian Market institution every bit as important as the butcher, the produce people, the spice merchant, etc. You could spend half your day flipping through the cookbooks, literary fiction and vintage records. More recently, people have been stopping in to pick up Red Tape, proprietor Molly Russkoff’s debut novel. The first printing sold out quick. 529 Bainbridge Street Nobody will say a word if you spend an hour wandering the cluttered aisles looking for exactly the right dusty old paperback to fit your mood. Upbeat, cool and mildly chaotic, Mostly Books has old-school South Street, odds-and-ends, love-of-the-game vibes. 1906 South Street Not enough people know about this cool little shop in the Graduate Hospital area. Most of their shelves are reserved for secondhand books, but they make room for plenty of new and classic titles as well. And don’t miss out on their comic books, greeting cards handmade by local artists, and author-inspired t-shirts. 1726 East Passyunk Avenue This smart, stylish South Philly bookshop has lots of new and interesting reads, but they’re extra cool for putting local authors and publishers on a pedestal. Keep an eye on their calendar for readings of the book and tarot variety. 618 South 6th Street Philly has no shortage of revered/underserved comic book sellers, but let’s give a shout out to this Bella Vista gallery and shop that specializes in underground titles and in-store events featuring the likes of Charles Burns, Daniel Clowes, Maria Bamford. 710 Street 5th Street P.A.T. is only partly a bookshop, but the selection is somehow always worthwhile and affordable. 333 South Broad Street This looks interesting — a store and gallery space dedicated to zines, handmade books, art books and other stuff of the DIY variety. It’s by appointment only; the calendar includes exhibitions, workshops and other events. 5445 Germantown Avenue This Germantown bookshop and community cultural hotspot — run by renowned author and Temple professor Marc Lamont Hill — has a very good slogan: “Cool People. Dope Books. Great Coffee.” Uncle Bobbie’s calendar is often packed with some of the biggest names in books and media, and frequently hosts readings in off-site locations that can handle a crowd. 1525 North American Street, studio 104 A sparse, stylish space in Olde Kensington dedicated to artists’ books and other independent art-related publications. 704 South Street A holdout from South Street’s wilder days, the Wooden Shoe has a rep for reading material with an activist/anarchist edge, including alternate histories, children’s books, banned books, zines, manifestos, you name it. Baldwin’s Book Barn in West Chester is huge. And probably haunted! By books. And ghosts! And books, which are undead trees. The Archive 725 West 2nd Street, Lansdale A bookish friend tipped me off to this Montgomery County literary oasis disguised as a warehouse. In addition to records, CDs, and other pop culture curiosities, the Archive apparently has an attic brimming with cheap books and “the best back-issue magazine selection in the region.” It’s also an auction house. 865 Lenape Road, West Chester This place is amazing — just room after room, floor after floor of books in every genre. They’ve got lots of signed and first-print stuff, but also tons of cheap, rare and/or weird stuff. No wonder we called the rustic Baldwin’s Book Barn The Best Reason to Ditch Your Kindle a few years back. 45 West Broad Street, Hopewell, N.J. People with kids sing the praises of this cute children’s bookstore in central Jersey. Capricorn Books 605 West Ave, Jenkintown Founded by a artsy couple (she’s a food photographer and recipe developer, he’s musician and illustrator), Capricorn gets points for curation and presentation. 7 Manoa Shopping Center, 1305 West Chester Pike, Havertown Let’s just quote the 2021 Best of Philly write-up in its entirety: “Most of the 60,000 or so gently used items at this 17-year-old stalwart are, indeed, half their original price or less. Then there are new reads and rare works — some with a Philly provenance — all stocked by bibliophilic owners Shannon and Cathy Rutherford.” 349 Nassau Street, Princeton, N.J. A Princeton spot devoted to mystery books. People who read that sort of thing swear by this place. Also: People who read that sort of thing are up to something. 44 South Main Street, New Hope One of the crown jewels of New Hope, the bright and inviting family-owned Farley’s earns high marks for its reliable employee recommendations. This, I believe, is the highest praise one can bestow upon a bookshop. 3405 Pacific Avenue, Wildwood, N.J. Yeah, it’s way down the shore but this decades-old seasonal secondhand bookshop a couple blocks off the boardwalk is affordable, reliable and hopelessly quirky. Wildwood’s Hooked on Books is a quirky one-stop-shop for beach reads. 221 Haverford Avenue, Narberth The community-oriented bookstore offers new and used selections and bills itself as “a lovingly curated, forward-thinking haven for voracious readers.” 7900 High School Road, Elkins Park A small shop promising a “carefully curated” short list of titles. Sounds lovely. 2917 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City, N.J. This Atlantic City bookstore which is not at all in Princeton has an inviting storefront full of bookcases and the words WE BUY THE OLD painted in big block letters over the entrance. They know a thing or two about the sale and acquisition of used books, especially of the leather-bound variety. 114 Creek Road, Mt. Laurel Township, N.J.

Title: How Trump altered the government in ways that could benefit himself and his inner circle

After staffing the wealthiest presidential Cabinet in modern American history with energy and banking titans, President Donald Trump has spent his first three months in office boosting those industries while dismantling long-established guardrails against government corruption. A CNN review of Trump’s actions as he approaches the 100-day mark of his presidency found that as his administration has slashed the federal workforce and shaken the global economy with tariffs, the president’s team has made changes that could also directly benefit his Cabinet members or their former companies. At the same time, by gutting traditional oversight bodies and embracing historically lax ethics rules, Trump has enabled conflicts of interest and greased the revolving door between government and the private sector. At least eight nominees for executive branch positions would have been banned or had limited roles under previous administrations – including Trump’s first term – due to their recent work as lobbyists, according to an analysis by the watchdog Campaign Legal Center that was reviewed by CNN. Some potential conflicts have played out in plain view – like when Trump used the White House lawn last month to produce what seemed like an elaborate ad for key adviser and top donor Elon Musk’s struggling Tesla brand. The Trump administration has also cleared the way for Musk’s Starlink business to win new government contracts. But other examples of possible conflicts are found deep in Cabinet members’ ethics reports, such as Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s disclosure that he would receive a million-dollar bonus – after his swearing-in – from the fracking company he founded, led and now plays a role in regulating. Even as they’ve agreed to divest, some Cabinet members have found a loophole: giving control of certain assets to their adult children. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick handed the reins of his financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to his 27-year-old son, while Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he would give his interest in litigation against a vaccine maker – part of an industry he is now tasked with regulating – to his adult son. Some of Trump’s policies also could help his own business interests. By establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the president is backstopping the value of the cryptocurrency, enriching existing holders of the asset, some of whom spent millions helping reelect the president. Meanwhile, Trump and his family have moved to expand their own crypto interests. And this week, Trump sent the value of his personal meme coin soaring by promising its top buyers a chance to dine with the president next month. Many of the Trump administration’s early actions have pushed priorities that Republicans have sought for years, and the White House says its moves to slash regulations are needed to reduce spending and eliminate government inefficiency. “The people elected me to do the job, and I’m doing it,” Trump said in March. “My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.” But from cryptocurrency and energy policies to efforts as niche as rural internet access, some of the administration’s moves also closely align with the financial interests of his top advisers and the president himself. “This administration seems entirely indifferent to ethics, and that contrasts certainly with the past several administrations, including Trump one,” said Richard Briffault, a Columbia University law professor who studies government ethics. “The level of complete indifference to it takes us back to before Watergate.” In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress passed sweeping ethics legislation to hold the executive branch more accountable. Within weeks of beginning his second term, Trump flouted many of those decades-old protections – including by firing more than a dozen inspectors general and dismissing the head of the government’s ethics watchdog. He also signed an order making it easier for lobbyists to join agencies overseeing industries they used to represent. The United States has spent years building up an “ethics infrastructure,” Briffault said. “In less than 90 days, this administration has been tearing (it) down.” Trump’s unprecedented moves come as his Cabinet includes some of the richest people to ever hold the reins of power in the federal government. Many came straight from positions of power in key industries. CNN analyzed dozens of financial disclosures and ethics statements filed by presidential appointees to track the wealth and potential conflicts of interest among Trump’s Cabinet members. The disclosures offer a limited picture of nominees’ finances: Officials are only required to list their assets in broad ranges. Still, Trump’s leadership team appears to eclipse the wealth of any previous Cabinet going back decades. Of 21 Cabinet members, seven reported holding at least $10 million in assets, and some are even billionaires. Lutnick – who has been a Wall Street power player since the mid-1990s – has an estimated net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes. That’s roughly 15 times as much as the combined maximum reported net worth of former President Joe Biden’s entire outgoing Cabinet. Five Trump Cabinet members reported holding individual assets worth more than $50 million, the highest range on disclosure forms. And that doesn’t include Musk, the world’s richest person with a net worth of about $371 billion, who as a special government employee is not required to publicly report anything about his wealth. While Biden filled his Cabinet mostly with bureaucrats and politicians, Trump’s team also includes former CEOs who ran major energy and financial services companies before joining him in Washington. “We’re seeing industry officials coming into the executive branch in a way that we’ve never seen in past administrations, including the first Trump administration,” said Danielle Caputo, senior ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center. While supporters of Trump’s efforts say industry expertise helps officials better understand the fields they regulate, ethics watchdogs fear actions undertaken by highly-connected officials could benefit their former companies and colleagues instead of the American public. Some moves could particularly benefit the super-wealthy. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, for instance, has taken a chainsaw to the Internal Revenue Service, which includes a unit that audits America’s ultrawealthy. Data obtained by CNN and first reported by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that the Global High Wealth unit was hit by layoffs at a far higher rate through March of this year than the IRS as a whole. Trump has also rescinded a Biden-era executive order creating ethics requirements for political appointees. Members of the past three administrations — including those who worked under Trump during his first term — previously had to commit not to accept gifts from lobbyists. They were also banned from working on issues they lobbied on in the two years before their appointment, and after leaving government, couldn’t lobby on behalf of industries they’d recently regulated. Those rules would have banned or limited the roles of eight Trump nominees, including three officials tapped for Environmental Protection Agency roles who lobbied for fossil fuel groups in recent years, according to an analysis by Campaign Legal Center shared with CNN. Additionally, CLC found Trump has named at least six political appointees to serve as senior ethics officials, a role normally held by nonpartisan career officials. Inspectors general across more than a dozen different agencies were fired during Trump’s first week in office. The IGs act as independent watchdogs, and the president is supposed to provide a 30-day notice to Congress before removing them, which Trump failed to do. Trump defended the move by suggesting some IGs had been “unfair” and firing them was “a very standard thing to do.” On the campaign trail, Trump promised to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” He kicked off his second term with moves to boost the crypto industry such as establishing a national bitcoin reserve, dissolving a Biden-era task force that investigated crypto criminals, installing a Musk ally as “crypto czar” and revoking a banking rule that discouraged financial institutions from owning crypto. At the same time, Trump and his family have gotten deep into crypto by launching a new firm and the president’s own meme coin, a digital asset that has no underlying value and trades largely on hype. Trump also installed Lutnick, a banker who before his swearing-in was overseeing more than $1.5 billion in crypto-related investments, as his commerce secretary. Lutnick has long pushed to legitimize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Last October, while he was still CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, he told a podcast host he had “hundreds and hundreds of millions” of exposure to bitcoin, presumably through crypto assets held by his firm. Cantor Fitzgerald is now run by his son, which ethicists say leaves Lutnick with an improperly close tie to the firm’s success. “By turning it over to a family member, you may not benefit directly, but you surely have an interest in the well-being of your child,” said Briffault. Cantor Fitzgerald didn’t respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Trump’s sons launched a digital currency company, World Liberty Financial, in 2024, and took an ownership stake in a bitcoin mining venture called American Bitcoin last month. Trump’s own media company announced plans earlier this year to potentially buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At least eight top officials in the executive branch disclosed crypto holdings in their financial disclosures, although some agreed to divest the assets. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, HHS Secretary Kennedy and Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz each reported owning more than $500,000 in crypto assets. An HHS spokesperson told CNN that “Secretary Kennedy continues to adhere to all ethical and legal requirements.” So far, the Trump administration’s crypto moves haven’t led to a boom in valuations for digital assets. While the price of bitcoin, a bellwether for the $3 trillion crypto market, skyrocketed nearly 50% between Trump’s election victory and inauguration, it has fallen about 9% since then, mirroring broader stock market declines. Still, Eric Talley, a Columbia University professor who studies corporate law, said he saw the Trump administration’s efforts to promote crypto, and specifically the strategic bitcoin reserve, as “particularly suspicious.” “The economic stakes — if you were a heavy holder of crypto — would be huge and profoundly positive if you could cause the US government to essentially guarantee a big chunk of the stability of the market of at least some of the crypto issuances,” he said. During his time in the private sector, former fracking executive Chris Wright was a zealous and vocal critic of government regulations meant to curb global warming. His company Liberty Energy filed a lawsuit that challenged a federal rule requiring companies to disclose details about greenhouse-gas emissions. In one video he posted on social media, Wright declared, “There is no climate crisis.” Now, as energy secretary, Wright has authority to reverse some of the policies he railed against as Liberty’s CEO. Wright has ordered the department to “build energy infrastructure and remove barriers to progress,” among other steps, to achieve US “energy dominance.” Under his leadership, the agency has ceased its pursuit of a net-zero carbon future, cut fossil fuel regulations and accelerated numerous natural gas export projects. Inside the department, Wright has alarmed some staffers with his embrace of fracking over other energy projects. Four current Department of Energy employees, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, described a general attitude of hostility toward most renewable energy. One staffer pointed to webpages that once promoted solar energy and have now been taken offline, and other employees described circulating lists of renewable energy programs that could be on the chopping block. Having a former fracking executive run the energy department is “absolutely a conflict of interest,” one staffer said. Some of Wright’s former Liberty colleagues have also followed him into the department, including his current scheduling director, one of his advisers and a Liberty board member who has been nominated to serve as an assistant energy secretary. In the short term, falling oil prices due to economic turmoil under Trump could hurt fracking companies. But leaders at Wright’s former company have applauded the policy shifts. “We have an administration now that is working hard to remove some of the impediments that have been challenges,” Liberty Energy CEO Ron Gusek said at the New York Stock Exchange in March. “Those things give us a path forward to invest in our business.” According to his ethics documents, Wright owned about $54 million worth of Liberty stock as of February, though disclosures show he sold off Liberty shares in recent weeks and moved money into general investment funds. He also disclosed that he would receive a roughly $1 million performance bonus for his work last year from the fracking company in March, after his swearing-in. A Liberty filing last month stated he received his bonus. A Liberty spokesperson said, “To our knowledge, there has been no communication with Secretary Wright or any representative from the Department of Energy regarding Liberty Energy business.” While the fossil fuel industry cheers Wright’s successes, some communities that expected financial help from the Department of Energy have faced roadblocks. Under a program funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, for example, the department planned to disperse $500 million in grants to help schools in disadvantaged regions across the US improve their energy efficiency. But multiple school district administrators told CNN that since Wright took over, the department has largely stopped communicating with them about federal funding from the program. Now, some districts fear they won’t receive all the money they were promised. Mosier Community School, a public charter school in a rural Oregon county that voted for Trump, was awarded a roughly $870,000 grant from the program. That money could help replace the school’s unreliable century-old heater and windows that are currently held closed with tape, said Brent Foster, who leads a committee to upgrade the school’s infrastructure. This year, the DOE has canceled meetings with the school about the grant and has not been processing requests related to the project, according to Foster, who said he doesn’t know whether the funds will ever come through. Winning the grant “felt like a miracle,” Foster said. “The idea that the federal government would sign a contract… then pull the rug out from under us, it’s difficult to understand.” An Energy Department spokesperson said the agency is reviewing all activities to ensure they follow the law and align with the administration’s priorities. “President Trump’s administration is advancing a strategy of energy addition – embracing all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure,” said the spokesperson, who added that Wright has complied with department ethics requirements. The federal government has earmarked tens of billions of dollars to close the digital divide, connecting millions of rural Americans to fast, reliable internet. And for years, Musk’s SpaceX has tried to become eligible for the funds, at times without success. In 2022, the Federal Communications Commission rejected a nearly $900 million grant application by Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet system, saying the company failed to show it could deliver on the promised service. Similarly, the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program was specifically designed to prioritize the gold standard of broadband internet – fiber-optic cables – over other technologies such as satellite service. But that changed rapidly after Trump took office. Lutnick announced last month that the Commerce Department would end “woke mandates” and “favoritism towards certain technologies.” In practice, that means potentially opening up billions in funding for satellite internet companies. Lutnick’s directive could enable Musk’s company to earn up to $20 billion from the amended BEAD program, according the Wall Street Journal. Today, Starlink is uniquely positioned to provide commercial satellite-based internet. However, other companies, including Amazon, may compete for BEAD grants in the future. Musk has long criticized the federal government’s rural internet efforts, claiming that had the FCC not rejected Starlink’s grant application in 2022, “it would probably have saved lives in North Carolina” after Hurricane Helene decimated the area. The BEAD program, Musk said, is an “an outrageous waste of taxpayer money” that is “utterly failing to serve people in need.” SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Experts say satellite-based internet service could play a useful role in connecting low-density remote areas. But many argue a fiber-optic connection is more reliable and weather resistant than what satellite service can offer today. “Fiber can handle an almost unlimited amount of bandwidth. Fiber is scalable in terms of speed. Fiber is what we call ‘future proof,’” said Christopher Ali, a professor of telecommunications at Penn State University. Lutnick’s move to change the program is now prolonging delays in getting shovels in the ground, even as the GOP has blasted the Biden administration over its failure to spend the money more quickly. Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune and 12 additional Republican senators, for example, have said the program has “onerous regulations” and moves slowly due to “unnecessary government interference.” The Commerce Department didn’t respond to requests for comment. Some states with approved BEAD proposals are waiting for the green light from the federal government before starting work while others are amending their proposals. A final draft proposal dated March 2025 from West Virginia obtained by CNN details a plan to bring a fiber-optic internet connection to every resident in the state. But after Gov. Patrick Morrisey met with Lutnick later that month, he announced West Virginia would revise the proposal to “evaluate a broader range of technology options, including satellite.” “The West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council has always supported fiber deployment and continues to do so,” said Bill Bissett, who heads up the council. “Every day we delay is another day that West Virginians who are underserved or unserved will not have access to this critical resource,” he added. Because of Lutnick’s change, government officials will “re-run a process they’ve already completed solely to put satellite service in places that were going to get fiber,” said Evan Feinman, who until recently oversaw the rollout of the BEAD program. “That service will be dramatically slower, less reliable in bad weather … and will cost at least $800 more per year (per household) than the fiber connections would have been.” The change in direction of the BEAD program is the “poster child for why people should be concerned about conflicts of interest” in this administration, said Briffault, the Columbia law professor, who spoke about how members of Trump’s inner circle could be putting a thumb on the scale. “You cannot be confident that the decision is being made on the policy merits, as opposed to the influence of a self-interested individual who stands to make a ton of money on it,” he said.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Safariland®, a brand of The Safariland Group, a leading global provider of safety products designed for the public safety, military, professional and outdoor markets and one of Cadre Holdings, Inc.’s (NYSE: CDRE) (“Cadre”) key brands, is excited to announce its enhanced collaboration with Axon Enterprise, Inc. (“Axon”) in developing the newest suite of holsters and accessories compatible for use with Axon Signal Sensor. This joint effort delivers purpose-built technology that supports public safety agencies by enabling hands-free activation of Axon body-worn and fleet cameras, helping to ensure critical moments are captured while allowing officers to focus on the task at hand. Signal Sensor, formerly known as Signal Sidearm, wirelessly alerts nearby Axon cameras to begin recording the moment a firearm is drawn from a compatible holster, for both real-time situational awareness and transparent post-incident documentation of Use of Force (UoF) incidents. Coming this year, 17 updated holsters from Safariland’s 6000 series will be released with dedicated integration for Signal Sensor, along with eight newly developed firearm fits for the recently introduced Ballast Duty Holster. Safariland will also introduce six non-firearm UoF pouches compatible with Signal Sensor allowing integration with equipment, such as Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray, batons and handcuffs. The Signal Sensor unit can also be installed on a range of existing in-market holsters using an adapter designed for backward compatibility. Safariland has worked closely with Axon to simplify the process of ensuring holster compatibility with Axon’s Signal Sensor technology. With a wide range of adaptable holsters, agencies can seamlessly integrate Signal Sensor units either within the holster or mounted, using a bracket. Whether an agency is already equipped with Signal Sensor technology or planning future implementation, achieving compatibility is now easier than ever. “This collaboration sets a new standard for integrated duty gear technology and reflects our commitment to officer safety and innovation,” said Eric Gasvoda, Vice President and General Manager of Duty Gear for Safariland. “We are proud to partner with Axon in delivering a solution that enhances both situational awareness and accountability.” “Working with Safariland allows us to push the boundaries of what’s possible in connected public safety technology and expand holster coverage to protect more lives in more places,” said Craig Trudgeon, Senior Vice President of Product at Axon. “This collaboration enables us to broaden our coverage to include additional models in the future — delivering smarter, more seamless tools that empower officers and build trust within communities.” Safariland and Axon will announce the integrated holster collaboration in Phoenix during the 2025 Axon Week, April 22-25. Axon Week is a premier event focused on public safety technology and innovation.

Title: Google Calls More Remote Staff Back to Office—or Else

We forget how good we had it. Google is putting the last nails in the work-from-home coffin as it orders more remote employees to return to offices on a hybrid schedule or risk losing their jobs. The endless cubicle farms, which could have been repurposed for better use like housing or shopping, are not going anywhere just yet. CNBC reports that teams in Google’s Technical Services and People Operationsâor human servicesâdivisions were told this week they must report to their closest office three days a week or take a voluntary exit package. Some in human resources approved for remote work and who live 50 miles or more away from an office can remain in their positions, but cannot take new roles in the company. The news is hardly a shock. Google has been demanding employees return to offices since implementing mass layoffs in early 2023, and just about every major company has swung back jarringly from the early pandemic, when employees were allowed to work from anywhere. Some company leadersâincluding Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorseyâhad once proclaimed that remote work was here to stay forever. The contrast between working in tech from 2010-2020 vs 2020-now is so jarring to think about I sometimes feel like the 2010's couldn't have been real — BuccoCapital Bloke (@buccocapital) April 24, 2025 Despite record profits and earnings, tech companies have said their companies became too bloated during the pandemic, and layoffs would give them more resources to invest in the expensive artificial intelligence build outs. Terminating workers under the guise of remote work could be an excuse to eliminate staff they did not want anyway. Some employees laid off by in recent years Meta, for instance, have reported being added to “do not rehire” lists despite performing above expectations during their tenure. That company laid off an additional 5% earlier this year, but did attribute those cuts specifically to performance. Critics of return-to-office mandates have pointed out the irony of the tech industry in particular eliminating remote work, since the entire idea of the internet was to decentralize communication and enable a flattened, global economy that does not rely on power centers like Silicon Valley. Many people moved when they went remote, stimulating smaller economies. But alas, there is a network effect to being around like-minded individuals, and much of the tech sector is still concentrated in San Francisco. Sergey Brin, one of Google’s reclusive cofounders, told employees in a meeting early this year that 60 hours a week in-office is the sweet spot for staff working on developing cutting-edge AI products and keep up with the competition. Somewhat ironically, luminaries like Brin and Klarnaâs Sebastian Siemiatkowski have said they believe AI will eliminate the need for as many programmers, though others say it will simply increase velocity of new product development. âAs weâve said before, in-person collaboration is an important part of how we innovate and solve complex problems,â Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini said in a statement to CNBC. âTo support this, some teams have asked remote employees that live near an office to return to in-person work three days a week.â Employees in tech do not have much of a choice in the matter. Recurring waves of mass layoffs have returned power to leadership after a decade in which tech workers could expect enormous compensation and benefits packagesâas well as demand their employers abide by lofty mission statements and shun more ethically dubious work, like defense contracting. CEOs have griped that remote workers are less productive, but the data to support that belief is mixed. There may be some decrease in productivity, and junior employees can benefit from being in office. But turnover is lower amongst remote workers, and by working from home, employees save time commuting. Proponents argue that the remote work model is in fact more performance based than relying on butts-in-seats as a metric for measuring employee productivity. A slew of surveys have found that Americans prefer employers who offer remote work for the added lifestyle benefits, and many would even take a pay cut of up to 20% in order to work remotely. Some employees in tech have been so resistant that they have gone out kicking and screaming, using techniques like “coffee badging” to show up at work for an hour to swipe their badge and go right back home. Meta and Amazon responded by requiring employees to continuously report their location throughout the day. Demanding employees come back to the office is one big way to claw back power. Leaders at Google and others have reasserted themselves in other ways, like shutting down protests and open discussion over company policies that in previous years were encouraged. Leaders apparently now believe that protest and internal dissent harms productivity and that everyone should be laser-focused on the company’s mission. Plus, it’s no fun when your own employees are complaining about you publicly. The national office vacancy rate remains elevated from 2019 levels, suggesting remote work is here to stay, just not to the same degree as during the early pandemic.

The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” that alleged, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit.

Despite getting progressively more expensive and rarer, the Gears don’t follow a linear performance progression. This Grow a Garden Gears Tier List regularly updates to follow the current meta, so you know which to invest in for your produce. Start growing your garden on Roblox. For more on gears, check out my general Gears Guide, detailing the price, rarity, and use of each type. Let’s get right into the rankings! These Gears financially pay off and then some! If you want to rapidly increase your produce profits and uncover some unusually large and valuable crops, invest in these Gears! These Gears are decent alternatives if you can’t afford or find the S-Tiers in stock. They help grow the size of your produce and uncover valuable mutations, but aren’t as efficient as those in the top tier. Nestled into the average tier, these Gears are solid options to make a quick buck. They’re not the most powerful or fruitful (get it?), but they’re profitable! Whilst not entirely useless, you could safely avoid these Gears and not miss out on much. They’re not great for long-term profits, and hardly make their money back. I wouldn’t recommend investing in these Gears. You’re better off waiting for Mother Nature to handle your crops than sink money into these.

Title: An Apple Bull Trimmed Its Price Target on the Stock Today. Here's Why.

One of Wall Street's Apple bulls pared their optimism on the tech giant's shares today. Bank of America analysts on Thursday maintained their "buy" rating on Apple (AAPL) stock, but they also trimmed their price target by $10, lowering it to $240. (That's still above the Street's mean near $234, according to Visible Alpha.) Their reasons: tariff-related costs that could weigh on margins, along with concerns that delayed AI features could dent device demand. The stock, meanwhile, was ticking higher as broader markets rose. Apple's shares were recently up 0.6% to above $205. Apple is set to join the parade of Magnificent Seven tech companies to report earnings, with its next set of results due next Thursday after the closing bell. Bank of America expects some tariff-driven "pull forward" to have helped lift sales during the most recent quarter, but they're cutting longer-term sales estimates "to adjust for higher costs of navigating a more complex supply chain and for delays in launching an AI enabled Siri." Apple's shares are down about 18% so far this year, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500. Research firm Vanda earlier this week noted recent net selling of Apple by retail investors even as net buying continued elsewhere—such as shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). "Individuals continue to give off capitulation-lite signals, but a full-blown unwind remains moderately far on the horizon," Vanda wrote in a Wednesday note.

FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a vocal supporter of Starlink, but on Wednesday, he touted SpaceX rival AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing satellites for cellular connectivity. On X, Carr posted pictures of his visit with GOP Senator Ted Cruz to AST SpaceMobile’s headquarters in Midland, Texas. One picture includes Carr and Cruz posing with AST SpaceMobile CEO Abel Avellan in front of the company's offices. He also published a video discussing the importance of AST, saying the company is creating manufacturing jobs in the US and helping the country counter China’s satellite ambitions. “Importantly, it’s going to help us secure our national defense, including by making sure we stay ahead of China,” Carr says. Curiously, Carr’s tweets didn’t mention AST by name. Instead, his video described the company as a “high-tech satellite production facility that’s putting up the biggest satellites we’ve ever had in the country.” AST’s CEO called out the video, posting on X: “Proud to be based in Texas, where we build and test our American satellite technology.” AST SpaceMobile still needs to secure FCC licenses to test and commercially operate its satellites. Last year, the commission only granted AST limited authority to operate its first five “BlueBird” satellites while tabling its request to launch and operate an additional 243 satellites. AST is also preparing to launch and test an even larger, more powerful BlueBird prototype satellite. But last week, the Indian Space Research Organisation postponed the satellite’s launch from Q2 to July. The FCC must also clear that prototype satellite for experimental testing, which could take months. AST faces a tight timeline since its mobile carrier partners in Europe and Japan want to start rolling out the satellite connectivity next year. The company needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit before it can offer continuous coverage over the US. The resulting satellite network is poised to compete against SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is currently available as a beta and will officially launch in July through T-Mobile. Although Carr has supported Starlink, he’s indicated he backs next-generation satellite players in general. This includes saying the FCC must streamline regulations for Starlink and Amazon’s satellite internet rival, Project Kuiper. He’s also urged European governments to adopt Starlink over Chinese satellite services.

Title: China Market Update: Tariff Talk Roller Coaster Continues

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Online education company TAL Education missed on the big three (revenue, net income, and earnings per share), despite top-line revenue growth increasing by +42% year-over-year, as selling, marketing, administrative expenses increased to $336 million from $24 million YoY, which weighed on bottom line net income and EPS. The company only used $13.1mm of its $490.7mm share repurchase program, which is strange to me. Thus far, no analyst has asked management about relisting in Hong Kong. I will provide a Hong Kong relisting update via Twitter (@ahern_brendan). Asian stocks were lower, except for Vietnam, which outperformed the region. This followed roller coaster comments Wednesday, as President Donald Trump suggested tariff rollbacks could be in the cards soon. China’s Ministry of Commerce threw cold water on Trump’s suggestion that talks are already in motion. The MoC said, “There are no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States, at present.” The comments indicate a lack of understanding that the "Art of the Deal" requires Kabuki theatre, drama, and showmanship. Hopefully, the two sides will communicate with one another at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington this week. Premier Li and the State Council once again reiterated that it is necessary to “stabilize the stock market and continue to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market." Mainland media outlet Yicai noted that U.S. shipments of liquid natural gas to China went to zero in March, versus 412,500 tons in March 2024, as China’s 99% LNG tariff and 94% oil tariff take hold. The European container shipping index futures fell -9% overnight. It is hard to know whether fewer boats going to the U.S. means more supply for Europe, leading to the price decline, or indicating the trade war is weighing on the global economy. Regardless, the two sides should get talking, in my humble opinion. Without question, the biggest news was declines in Meituan and JD.com shares, which fell -5.15% and -6.19%, respectively, overnight, as JD reported a substantial uptick in its new restaurant delivery service. The likely price war is apt to weigh on the companies’ financials. JD.com, as the leader in online electronic sales, was well-positioned to benefit from the new electronic subsidies through the expansion into restaurant delivery, curbing investor enthusiasm. The price action seems to be an instance of "shooting first and asking questions later, " as investors recall self-defeating battles, including that between Didi and Uber. Internet stocks were off, as defensive plays such as banks, nonferrous metals, mining, and telecom outperformed. It is worth noting that Southbound Stock Connect had $436 million worth of net buying, concentrated in Alibaba and Meituan. Mainland investors now hold 8.64% of Alibaba’s shares outstanding. Southbound Stock Connect's percentage ownership continues to rise. Tencent is 11.78% owned by Mainland investors, Kuaishou is 15.76% owned, and Meituan is 10.96% owned, based on shares outstanding. Today, 43% of Hong Kong’s turnover was via Southbound, which indicates the lack of foreign investor participation, which was out of sight, and out of mind. Mainland China had a non-eventful night, as banks and insurance outperformed, battery giant CATL gained +1.51%, and Midea gained +1.53%. These were rare growth outperformers in the current market. Software and technology, including electronic equipment and communications equipment, underperformed. The National Team’s favored ETFs had very light volumes. Carmaker BYD reports Friday.

Title: Google Earnings Will Be Biggest Q1 Report Yet As Investors Search For Tariff And Recession Impacts
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/04/24/google-earnings-will-be-biggest-q1-report-yet-as-investors-search-for-tariff-and-recession-impacts/

Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts. One Community. Many Voices.

The agreement marks the first full-scale flight test contract awarded by Kratos through the MACH-TB 2.0 program-a $1.45 billion effort aimed at expanding access to hypersonic testing. Rocket Lab was added to the MACH-TB 2.0 subcontractor team in January, building on its prior MACH-TB engagements, which included three successful test launches, two of which occurred within a three-week span. HASTE, the Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron, is a modified version of Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, tailored for suborbital missions. Sharing core technologies like 3D-printed engines and carbon composite structures, HASTE is designed with a reconfigured upper Kick Stage and can accommodate payloads up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). It supports testing of hypersonic, glide, ballistic, and atmospheric reentry systems at speeds exceeding 7.5 km/s. Across both its HASTE and Electron platforms, Rocket Lab has launched over 200 payloads. "In less than two years since its first launch, HASTE has quickly emerged as a leading commercial test platform of hypersonic systems. With our operational speed and cadence, and the ability to serve multiple mission profiles all in one platform, HASTE is helping to move the needle on hypersonic innovation. I'm confident this will be the first of many new opportunities to serve the nation through the MACH-TB program, and we're proud to be working alongside Kratos to bring this test flight to the launch pad on a rapid timeline," said Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck. This mission joins a growing schedule of HASTE launches set for 2025 and 2026. Among upcoming flights is a test for the Defense Innovation Unit involving a scramjet-powered vehicle, an extension of a five-launch agreement with Leidos, and a classified hypersonic test for an undisclosed client. In parallel with MACH-TB, Rocket Lab's HASTE platform has been incorporated into other major defense initiatives. In the United States, HASTE is now eligible under the $46 billion Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC), expanding its potential role in U.S. Air Force projects. In the UK, HASTE has been included in the Ministry of Defence's Pounds 1 billion Hypersonic Technologies and Capability Development Framework, reinforcing its international strategic value.

Title: Elon Musk’s Luck Runs Out

Why he didn’t see this coming Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts For a while, it seemed as if DOGE Elon and Tesla Elon could exist in the same space-time continuum. One of them carried out Donald Trump’s ruthless cost-cutting mission while the other pitched cars that appealed most to people who were highly likely to oppose that mission, or even rage against it. As activists spray-painted STOP DOGE on Teslas at dealerships and anti-Tesla protests spread all over the world, there still was no concrete proof that Elon Musk had to amend either version of himself. Then this week came Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report since Musk started his work with DOGE, showing the company’s profits down 71 percent from the same time last year. After a conference call, one major investor said Musk was “delusional.” Suddenly it seemed as if Musk was on a “Kanye West–like trajectory,” according to Patrick George, editor in chief of InsideEVs and our guest this week on Radio Atlantic. George has been covering Tesla since the 2010s. He’s watched Musk shoot himself in the foot in the lead-up to this moment, so he is well placed to understand why Musk didn’t see this coming. In this week’s episode, the Atlantic staff writer Charlie Warzel interviews George about how Musk found himself in this predicament. The following is a transcript of the episode: News clip: Growing backlash against Elon Musk and his new role in President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE— News clip: Protestors taking out their anger on the Tesla car and owners were busy all over the country— News clip: Tesla, the car company Musk founded and runs, has seen its stock price fall dramatically, as you can see from this chart— As Patrick George, the editor in chief of InsideEVs, wrote in The Atlantic this week: Luck runs out. Patrick George: I think he thought he would come in and gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader and that everything would’ve worked out great just the way it always has. He’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are, you know—they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here. [Music] Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is Radio Atlantic. My colleague Charlie Warzel interviewed Patrick George recently about the tumultuous journey Tesla’s been on, from darling of the environmentally conscious to target of tire slashing. And the two of them land on Musk’s blind spot, which caused him to miss this coming crash. Charlie Warzel: Patrick George, welcome to Radio Atlantic. Thank you for joining me. George: Great to be here, Charlie. Thanks for having me. Rosin: Their conversation explains so well how we got to this moment. George: Covering Tesla in the 2010s, the kind of hate mail we would get from people whenever we’d criticize the company or put something negative in one of the reviews of the Tesla, whatever—there were so many people back then who were such true believers in what he was doing, I mean, thinking that he’s saving the world. And I’m kind of sad for those folks now who really believed in this environmental mission of the company. Those are the ones who are dumping their Teslas. Those are the ones who feel abandoned right now, who feel betrayed by this guy they once believed in who has very much gone to what they perceive as the dark side. Warzel: What has been going through your head over the last few months as we’re watching, you know, Musk take this role in the government and have this interplay between his polarization and the stock? George: You know, every now and then, I have to step back when I read a sentence in the news or I even write a sentence on InsideEVs or for The Atlantic—you know, something like, President Trump holds a White House “summit” full of Teslas, you know, amid widespread protests against Elon Musk, his chief advisor and government cost cutter, that are happening all over the world, including vandalism. And I just stepped back, and I’m like, How did we get here? Like, is someone putting LSD in my coffee every morning? Like, this is just such a baffling, bizarre outcome from the way that Tesla’s trajectory has worked for the longest time and where it’s at now. You know, for lack of a better term, it’s kind of insane, honestly. When I started covering Tesla, and I was a young writer at Jalopnik—I started at the end of 2012. And one of the first things I did was my then–editor in chief, Matt Hardigree, and I—we interviewed Elon Musk from the Tesla factory floor when they were trying to get the Model S up and running. You know, the first car was the Roadster. And that was kind of a science project, honestly. It was a Lotus Elise stuffed with laptop batteries, more or less. And the Model S was their first real car. And they were trying to get it ramped up. And we talked to him, on the factory floor. And I remember, you know, him being at the time very tired but, you know, charming, smart, but also self-deprecating. We were doing stories on those early Model S’s is having all kinds of quality problems. And he was going, Yeah, we’re working on it, but we’re doing this Herculean effort to get it up and running. And, you know, I still think the Model S—the original one—is the most important car of the 21st century, because that was what proved the case of electric vehicles for the whole world. Because they were golf carts before that. They were, you know, the Nissan Leaf Codas, things like that. And it became this It Car in Hollywood. You probably remember this. Everybody—all the celebrities were trading in their Prius for the Model S. And it was fast, and it was sexy. I mean, it could smoke a Porsche 911 in a drag race. Like, a Prius couldn’t do that. And over time, we covered this guy and his company. It’s like, Hey! Here’s this quirky guy who’s kind of breaking all the rules, and he’s doing some cool stuff, and he’s also clearly an asshole too. And he’s insane about some things. But what they’re coming up with is this really interesting alternative to gas. And I can just say personally, you know, by the end of the last decade, I kind of realized that this is the future. This isn’t just a niche alternative to gasoline. It’s the future. And that wouldn’t have happened without Tesla. But there are so many shades along the way of what happened with him that kind of inform where we’re at now, just the way that he treated the press, the way that he treated open access to his company, the way that he treated his own public image, the sort of vindictiveness against his enemies. He can be very vain, certainly. He’s very obsessed with his own public image, you know, very vindictive—obviously, calling that cave diver the “pedo guy” or getting in a huge amount of trouble for saying he had the funds to take Tesla private. He had this Kanye West–like trajectory. It’s like, This guy’s brilliant, but he’s also horrible. And over time, the horrible part of him sort of overtakes that. But, you know, this amount of wealth that he amassed came with this tremendous amount of power. And I think he has gotten really into his own myth and own legend about exercising that power in unprecedented ways. Warzel: So I’ve always been fascinated with the correlation between Tesla’s stock price and Musk as a persona. There’s an analyst at Moody’s who said, quote, “I do think fundamentally that a significant fraction of Tesla’s value is due to the fact that Elon can command this attention continuously,” which sort of suggested to me that Musk is almost like a human meme stock. So I’m kind of curious: How much do you think Tesla’s value is just tied to this future projection of Elon Musk as this guy who’s going to, you know, either have that Edison-esque ability to innovate beyond any constraints or just that, you know, he can kind of brute force his way into making the future bend to his will? George: I think that the value of the company, the image of the company, is extremely driven by him and by his involvement in it. Another analyst we talk to a lot who’s one of the most bullish of all Tesla bulls, Dan Ives at Wedbush, you know, he says repeatedly, Elon is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story. And he said that Elon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon. The idea is that he has had so much success and he’s generated so much value for the company before that surely he’ll do it again, and he’ll keep doing it, and he’s the key driver of that. I’m not sure there is a company in modern times that is so intrinsically linked to one person. Probably the closest analog was Apple and Steve Jobs. I mean, this has also led to kind of lack of accountability with Musk, too, because I think that at any other company, certainly any company in the auto industry that we would cover, if you’ve seen the value of the company get so tanked this hard over a number of months, that person, that CEO would’ve been shown the door by now. But there is this belief that Musk is uniquely the one person who will deliver the future. And that’s something he’s built up himself. Certainly, that’s a myth he’s built up himself. I go back to the early days of Tesla, right? The really early days, like, in the 2000s, there was a New York Times article about Tesla Motors and what they were doing. And Musk—before he was CEO, he was just, like, an angel investor and heavily involved in the company—was furious because it didn’t mention him at all. So he always wanted his image to be wrapped up in that. Long before he owned Twitter, he was one of the central figures on Twitter and really used Twitter to get around traditional media and get around press releases and events and things like that to reach that audience directly and build up a following directly. And you said the phrase meme stock earlier. We hear that quite a bit now, and it’s like, okay, admitting that Musk is damaging the company or wanting him out, that will collapse a lot of that value. So, like, there is an incentive to sort of keep this vibe—I almost want to say grift—going, so it keeps, you know, printing money as it has before. Warzel: I think this protest movement is extremely fascinating. I was in the Bay Area recently, and I was blown away. The person I was visiting used to own a Tesla, and they said— George: Used to? Warzel: Yeah. And, well, this was a while back. But they said that the person they sold it to, a friend, had it keyed the other day. Even just on a very small scale, if it’s not a protest, there seems to be lots of acts of, like, casual vandalism and things like that. And then, as recently as March, I think there was a protest at nearly every Tesla dealership in the United States. So the movement seems to be somewhat durable. And yet I think the very initial parts of this protest we watched coincide with a pretty substantial drop in the stock, so much so that you have Elon Musk and Donald Trump basically doing a Tesla infomercial on the White House South Lawn, right? Teslas and EVs have always had a political valence, but does Tesla have a clear idea of what its brand is now? Because I don’t know if it’s going to sort of reclaim that green, progressive halo anytime in the near future. George: I actually do think that the backlash against Tesla is the biggest crisis it’s ever faced, bigger than when it was a tiny start-up trying to get its first real car out in ’08, when the world was crashing—bigger than when COVID happened, and it had to shut down its factories. I think this is the biggest crisis it has ever faced as a company. And you said at the beginning of our chat, Charlie, the word polarizing, right? And Tesla’s interesting because it’s always been a polarizing brand. Like, when it was embraced by liberals and Californians and the Hollywood crowd, you know, like, the rest of America was like, Hey, you have a Tesla. You’re so smug. You know, you’re saving the world, huh? And now it’s kind of flipped on its head, right? Now you have all of these folks in California who are trying—and kind of everywhere, they’re trying—to get rid of their Teslas, like Democratic-leaning, progressive-leaning, even center-leaning people who are done with the brand because of Elon, because of DOGE. Meanwhile, you have Fox News defending him left and right, saying that he’s an American hero who must be protected at all costs. And you know, Pam Bondi saying she’s going to stick up for him. I mean, what a bizarre reversal this is. And at the same time, there is no evidence we have seen that buyers in red states, more conservative-leaning folks, are going to be flocking the Teslas en masse. Like, I don’t want to stereotype here, but there are many, many studies and data points that we’ve reported on over the years that show that conservative-leaning voters are more skeptical of electric vehicles than liberal-leaning folks are. And that’s a climate-change thing. And it’s also just, like, how they’ve been trained to view EVs over the years, you know? So it’s like, Are you for EVs or not? You want Elon to succeed, but you’re not going to buy his car. You know, like, I have family in deep-red Texas, and, you know, when we were down there recently, everyone was saying, Elon’s the best. He’s great. He’s, you know, cutting government waste. It’s like, Okay, well, would you buy one of his cars? Absolutely not. No. It’s like, that is a problem—that is a problem with them being able to sell cars. And my personal theory is: The ultimate test of this is going to be the new Model Y, which just came out. And, you know, for those of you who don’t know, and I bet there’s a good amount of people listening to this who probably own a Model Y, this is the best-selling EV in the world. By some metrics, that’s the best-selling car in the world. There’s a new one out. It looks a little different. The specs are better. It has more range. They fixed the interior up. It’s nicer. All things equal, this should be the best-selling car in the world again. This should pull a repeat. And if this thing doesn’t sell, if it has lousy—you know, it just went on sale now, so we’re not going to know in the first quarter, but if a Q2, Q3, Q4 rolls around and this thing is sitting on dealer lots unsold, that is an existential problem for Tesla. That’s a disaster moment for them. I think that would be the ultimate proof that they have totally alienated any potential buyers or fans that they might have once had. Warzel: But at the same time, we just talked in this conversation about Musk’s, you know, ability to buoy the company and the stock. Do you think that is under threat, essentially? George: Yeah. And that’s where the disconnect is, right? Is because the stock price at Tesla is all predicated on future stuff. It’s solving autonomous driving. It’s robotaxis. It’s artificial intelligence, which Musk has gotten really into in recent years. It’s predicated on robots too. Like, they see the future as automation. It’s not car sales. It’s not duking it out with Nissan and Volkswagen over market share. Like, he doesn’t think that’s going to propel the company to its, you know, trillion-dollar value and take him to the stars and help him start his Mars colony someday if he’s just, you know, selling cars. When we’re talking about why its value is so high, it’s not just because Elon is great. It’s because for the last decade, Elon Musk has been personally promising that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis are, you know, about a year away—something he’s been saying since 2016, about. You know, that is the value of the company. That’s where all that money is wrapped up. It’s the idea that this company specifically will solve self-driving cars. Never mind the fact that, you know, Google’s Waymo has years more experience—you know, many, many, many miles more experience. Warzel: Yeah, they’re on the roads. George: They’re on the roads. Yeah. You could go to—what?—half a dozen cities in America and use a Waymo. So they’re years ahead of Tesla at actually getting a quote-unquote “robotaxi” service on the road. But there’s still that belief, with all they’ve invested, that they’ll be the ones to deliver autonomous cars one day. That’s the “valuation of Tesla” part of it. But it’s still a car company. Its revenue still comes from being a car company. Its revenue still comes from other car companies buying regulatory credits—meaning, you know, they pollute so much so they buy credits from Tesla to offset their polluting. That’s a huge source of their revenue. So he may have these grand dreams of robots and space and AI and everything else, but right now, it does need to sell cars. It does need to move metal. And if it can’t do that and the revenue tanks, you know, you can forget AI and robotaxis. And the other thing I think about, too, is supposedly they’re going to be launching their robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Okay. Right. Well, if he’s made this brand so caustic and so controversial, who’s going to want to use that service? I mean, is it really going to be some widespread thing like Uber, or are people going to go out of their way to avoid it? And I think that latter outcome is a very real possibility here. [Music] Warzel: When we’re back, I ask Patrick George to explain why Tesla’s crisis may be existential for reasons beyond Elon Musk. [Break] Warzel: So putting aside Musk just a moment here: The protests we’ve mentioned have been noticeable. I’m curious: What are the non-Musk-related threats to Tesla, right? We have Tesla having this real, genuine, first-mover advantage, especially in the United States. But it’s not alone anymore. You’ve got Rivian. You’ve got Polestar. You’ve got, you know, a series of EV competitors. Taking the Musk and Trump out of it, what does the company have to worry about right now? George: Yeah, let’s start with competition, right? Because it’s not just the start-ups you mentioned. It’s that Tesla sparked this industry-wide shift towards electrification. And when we say electrification, that means more hybrids and eventually a move to an all-EV market. And this started in kind of the middle-end of the last decade, when all of these traditional automakers started chasing Tesla’s value. Like, when you’re Ford or you’re Toyota, you’re looking at Tesla like, Why the hell are they valued so much more than we are? Like, we need to be like Tesla. We need to become tech companies. We need to electrify. And it took them years to do it. And, I mean, let’s be honest. Like, not all of them are pulling this off, this transformation from being traditional carmakers to being, you know, makers of software and battery-powered vehicles. Like, this is all we write about at InsideEVs. It’s just the struggles to do that. But they’re getting there. And some of them are now surpassing Tesla in many ways. Like, you can buy a Hyundai or a Kia with more range than a Tesla has, and faster charging. There’s stuff Volvo’s coming out with that has, you know, 400-plus miles of range. There’s better performance from cars like Audi now that are electric also. So Tesla started this, but they haven’t been able to keep up, and that’s been a huge criticism of this company for a long time, is they haven’t kept their product lineup fresh, as every company should. Like, there was the Cybertruck and then one update to the Model 3 sedan. Beyond that, there hasn’t really been a lot. And meanwhile, you have other companies coming out with, like, three-row SUVs and more crossovers and just more different options in the EV space. And that’s just in the West. The other problem is that once they set up shop in China, which Tesla’s Shanghai factory is what has provided them with stable long-term profits since the early part of this decade. But it also got the entire Chinese auto industry—took that baton and ran with it. And, I mean, you know, we see all the time—like, you probably heard the news last few weeks: The Chinese automaker BYD has a new technology for five-minute EV fast charging. Like, nothing in America comes close to that, and we probably won’t for a decade or more. So with its incredible industrial might, like, China is racing way ahead of Tesla, and Tesla’s kind of a stale brand there. So between the protests in America and Europe that are tanking sales, and the fact that Chinese buyers are moving on to other brands, like, I think the picture doesn’t look great for this company. Warzel: A big thing that I have seen as sort of an EV dilettante is the notion of, you know, especially in America, Tesla’s charging network, and that infrastructural portion being really important to the company. The idea of the BYD extremely fast chargers, like, are those, in your mind, existential threats to Tesla? George: Not any one thing, but put it all together, and yes. And remember what we said about how so much of Tesla’s value is locked up in solving autonomous cars? Well, BYD also has—they call it God’s Eye, an autonomous-driving system that they’re putting on, like, Toyota Corolla–priced vehicles in China. So, like, I can’t attest this myself. It’s obviously hard for us to test Chinese cars as extensively as we would here. But, like, this company claims to have done something Tesla’s promised for a long time, but a hell of a lot cheaper. Then you have faster charging. Then you have the fact that, you know, China’s full of—what?—two dozen Tesla-esque companies that are racing ahead. All these little things adding up, like, it’s like a dam bursting almost—that just all these things that this company pioneered, it can’t keep up with at scale. Tariffs and geopolitical tensions keep BYD and the other Chinese car companies out of our market for now. I personally tend to think that’s a temporary thing, at best, and that capitalism, even China’s version of it, tends to find a way. But, you know, once that happens and one of these automakers is able to sell in this country or even build cars in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee or whatever, and you know, the Americans can get a taste of something that far surpasses a Tesla for much cheaper, I think that’s going to be a real headache for that company. Warzel: Well, and as you’re saying all this, what’s running through my mind is this, like, complex threat matrix. You know, like, everyone’s sort of encircling Tesla in this way. And meanwhile, Elon Musk—who I said I was going to keep out of it for a second, but I have to bring him back in— it seems from the outside, was not paying any attention to any of this. George: Certainly busy, but he’s also remarkably tactical. I don’t believe, based on everything I’ve heard and read and interviewed, and associates I’ve talked to about the guy—like, he does think many moves ahead. And I think part of the reason that Tesla’s stock price shot up after the election was this belief that by working with Trump, Elon can sort of carve out a regulatory framework, get rid of regulations in America that limit the deployment of autonomous cars—like, essentially that by working with Trump, they could, you know, deploy autonomous cars and robotaxis more quickly nationally and in a way that’s favorable to Tesla. Because right now, the regulations governing autonomous cars are state by state. It’s municipality by municipality. It’s very patchwork. But if you had a federal framework, and if that framework was favorable to Tesla, you know, that is a game changer for their ability to deliver on the promise of their stock price. Like, that’s where my mind goes for the car company, specifically. And when Trump was still on the campaign trail right before the election, Elon said as much. He was basically up there being like, Yeah, we need a regulatory framework that’s going to work for autonomous cars. That’s all boring to say. But the idea is that when you watch Fox News and their defense of this great American business patriot, it’s just that he’s just a hero who is cutting government waste and getting rid of the deficit, when, in reality, I think that he used this to enrich his own companies and to clear out obstacles for the things he wants to do, especially when Tesla’s concerned for robotaxis. But that single-minded focus on autonomy and AI has meant they’ve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to products, when it comes to cars people can buy. And he’s been on record as saying that it’s pointless for us to come out with another car that has a steering wheel. Like, why would you do that? It’s like coming out with, like, a horse and buggy, but the technology’s not there yet. You know, for now at least, it does have to be a car company, and it does have to still do battle with Hyundai and General Motors and BYD, whether he wants it to or not. Warzel: It sounds like a very classic sort of—you know, as someone who’s followed Musk for a really long time—his obsession with the future, and I think genuine. Like, actual, genuine enthusiasm for the possibility of things. His sci-fi brain is so overactive that it causes this. Like, I’m sure that there’s an element of bullshitting here with, like, We’re going to be in Mars by 2030, and everyone’s going to be walking around. George: Been saying this stuff for 10-years-plus. Yeah. Warzel: But I think there is also a genuineness, too, right? Like, the steering-wheel thing feels very real to me, right? Like, This is right around the corner. Of course, we’re not going to build another car with the steering wheel. Meanwhile, every year that future pushes further and further away is another year that Tesla doesn’t have that product that can sort of fill the gap between his understanding of what is to come and the reality that, like, we’re just not there yet. George: Yeah. But this speaks to how they’ve been successful before. And it’s just—that’s the Musk mentality. You just kick down every door until you get what you want. And I go back to when they built the Model 3, you know, the first really affordable sedan. It’s not just that it’s a cheap electric car. It’s built in a completely different way than cars were built before. And the factory that builds it had to be completely reset from how car factories worked. It’s like, Just hit reset on everything, and just do it. That’s your goal. And you just do it. But they are running into technological limitations with how they do autonomous driving. Like, they are not there yet. And, like, I’ve used autopilot. I’ve used full self-driving for many years. I have seen it get better. Warzel: Those are Tesla features. George: Yeah, of course. Right. These are the self-driving Tesla features. I should say, they’re not really self-driving. This is what we would call a semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that kind of helps you on the highway or will take over some steering around town if we’re talking about full self-driving, and they’re getting better. Full self-driving tried to kill me on two separate occasions, Charlie, which really hurt my feelings. And it hasn’t done that in a while, but it’s still not a hundred percent. And for true autonomous driving to work, it has to be safer and better than a human every single time, in every single scenario. And they’re not there yet. Warzel: What is so difficult to put together for someone like myself—but I assume, also, a lot of different people who aren’t paying attention to Musk and Tesla, like, this granularly—we’re talking about an inability to fill the gap between the technological future of Musk’s imagination and the current moment, right? Do you think some of that is just, like, the margins of starting to, you know, suffer these consequences for not delivering? George: You know, a year ago, I kind of thought if Elon ever met his Waterloo, it would be his inability to deliver on these promises of autonomy and autonomous cars. Like, it would just get to the point where that technology’s just not there yet. You know? And maybe someday it will. I think on a long enough timeline, yeah—probably humans will not be driving cars. Maybe that’s 10 years from now or 100 years from now. I don’t know. But lately, I think that what may be his greatest downfall and what may be a kind of death blow to this company is his inability to understand people. He understands technology, but he doesn’t get people. And he has said, you know, empathy is a weakness. He doesn’t relate to other people well. You know, he’s blamed this on being neurodivergent, I guess. Either way, not a great people person. And I don’t think he counted on people abandoning the Tesla brand as furiously as they are, as quickly as they are, in response to him, in response to his actions with DOGE. I don’t think he counted on that. I think he thought he would come in and, you know, gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader, and that everything would’ve worked out great, just the way it always has, as he’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are—you know, they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here.

(Photo by Justin TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images) Meta Platforms' stock has declined approximately 13% this year, facing headwinds from potential tariff impacts that could affect the company in two significant ways: Despite this year’s setback, Meta has demonstrated remarkable resilience over a longer timeframe, with the stock gaining 56% since early 2022, substantially outperforming the broader Nasdaq index’s modest 7% increase. As an aside, after a negative reaction to earnings, Is IBM Stock Headed To $170? Meta’s outperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Meta Platforms has delivered impressive revenue growth of 39%, increasing from $118 billion in 2021 to $165 billion in the trailing twelve months. This robust performance stems from multiple growth drivers: Meta's profitability metrics show substantial improvement, with the net income margin expanding from 33.4% in 2021 to 37.9% currently. This enhanced profitability is complemented by a strategic 9% reduction in shares outstanding, made possible by the company's substantial $122 billion investment in share repurchases. The combination of higher revenues, expanded margins, and fewer outstanding shares has resulted in a 73% increase in earnings per share, rising from $13.77 in 2021 to $23.86 in the most recent period. Despite Meta's impressive financial performance across revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings improvement, its P/E ratio has declined by 10%. This valuation compression can be attributed to several factors: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your META stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While META remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report accusing Rocket Lab of misleading investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025. The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to at least September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026. The report also alleged that the Company’s only Neutron contract so far is a discount deal with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space. On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, nearly 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on January 27, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has declined approximately 18% this year, largely due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts on its business model. This is particularly significant as Amazon’s marketplace relies heavily on third-party sellers from China, making it vulnerable to import tariff increases. Even if the Trump administration eventually reduces these tariffs, Amazon’s operations may face lasting structural changes. Additionally, broader tariff-driven inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power, further impacting Amazon’s retail sales. Separately, What’s Going On With META Stock? Looking at a longer timeframe reveals an even more concerning picture: since early 2022, Amazon's stock has gained only about 9% over three years. This underperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Amazon has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 36% revenue increase, growing from $470 billion in 2021 to $638 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is driven by several sustainable factors: Amazon's net income margin has improved by approximately 31%, increasing from 7.1% to 9.3% during this period. This margin expansion primarily stems from the increasing contribution of AWS, which operates at substantially higher margins than the retail business. As AWS constitutes a larger percentage of overall revenue, it positively impacts the company's aggregate profit margins. The combination of revenue growth and margin expansion has resulted in a 71% increase in earnings per share, rising from $3.24 in 2021 to $5.53 in the last twelve months. Despite strong operational improvements, Amazon's P/E ratio has contracted by 36% (from 51.5 to 32.7) since 2021, reflecting several investor concerns: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While Amazon remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns even during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

InfoQ Homepage News Inflection Points in Engineering Productivity for Improving Productivity and Operational Excellence Apr 24, 2025 3 min read by Ben Linders As a company grows, investing in custom developer tools may become necessary. Initially, standard tools suffice, but as the company scales in engineers, maturity, and complexity, industry tools may no longer meet needs, Carlos Arguelles said at QCon San Francisco. Inflection points, such as a crisis, hyper-growth, or reaching a new market, often trigger these investments, providing opportunities for improving productivity and operational excellence. Carlos Arguelles gave a talk about Amazon’s inflection points in engineering productivity. When a company first starts, it doesn’t make sense for it to create its own developer tools, as there are plenty of excellent ones available in the industry, he said. But as a company grows (in number of engineers, in maturity, in customer adoption, in domains), investing in its own developer tools starts making sense: An inflection point is when that investment in engineering productivity that didn’t make sense before now suddenly does. This could be because the industry tools do not scale, or because the internal tools can be optimized to integrate better with the rest of the ecosystem, as Arguelles explained. A little papercut where each developer is wasting a couple of minutes per day in toil can add to hundreds of millions of dollars of lost productivity in a company like Amazon or Google. The more obvious inflection point that made investments in engineering productivity become feasible is the number of engineers. Maybe it didn’t make sense for your company to have its own CI/CD proprietary tooling when there were 3000 engineers, but it does when there are 10,000 engineers, because the savings in developer productivity with a toolchain optimized for the ecosystem have a significant return on investment, Arguelles said. He mentioned that the opposite is true as well. When your company is in hypergrowth it may make sense to have duplicate tools (each organization creating its bespoke tool so that it can independently move fast), but when the company stops growing (which is what happened in 2023 with all the big tech layoffs), it makes sense to consolidate tooling and defragment the world. Arguelles gave some more examples of inflection points, like reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence can provide an inflection point or entering an entirely different and new market. Sometimes the inflection point is a crisis or even a single operational issue that could have been prevented with the right tooling: For example, Amazon invested significantly in a number of load, stress, and chaos testing tools after the Prime Day incident of 2018 (where the Amazon Store was unavailable for hours during the busiest shopping day of the year). We had been talking about doing that for years, but that incident helped us sharpen our focus and build a solid case for funding those investments. Inflections can also happen when an organization experiences hyper-growth: I saw Amazon double in size every year, from 3000 engineers when I started in 2009, to 60k-70k in 2022. What this meant in practice is that we needed to be thinking about skating to where the puck was going to be, not where it currently was. Scaling needs and security needs often meant sooner or later we needed to create our own developer tools, Arguelles said. Over time, they developed tools to scale source code repositories and built their own tools for code reviews and CI/CD (including testing and deployment): Because of that hyperscale, we often found ourselves needing to re-think our architecture much sooner than we had envisioned. But it also provided ample opportunities to innovate and think differently! Inflection points are inevitable and occur naturally in many situations: a company drastically increasing or shrinking in terms of number of engineers, a crisis, reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence, or entering an entirely different and new market, Arguelles said. He concluded that it is important to have your eyes open, recognize when these inflection points are around the corner, proactively shape your engineering productivity tooling for the future, and seize the opportunities.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Port of Long Beach. Photo: Shutterstock/DJANA 575 By Bloomberg News Apr 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –For an increasing number of Chinese exporters, many of whom battled through the trade war in President Donald Trump’s first term and who have invested years to capture the spending power of American shoppers, it may be closing time in the US. With tariffs on Chinese imports at 145%, factories that make items like coffee machines and yoga pants have halted shipments to the US and have idled their assembly lines to a three or four day week. And while Trump has indicated that tariffs won’t stay that high on China forever, some fearful exporters are making permanent plans to withdraw from the US market and turn to other regions like the Middle East for sales instead. Exporters are now trying to “survive” the current crisis, said Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents some 3,000 exporters. Businesses are taking steps to generate cash like selling inventory for higher prices, and cancelling warehouse rental agreements in the US, she said. One such exporter is a Guangzhou-based retailer that sells underwear and yoga pants via Amazon, Temu and Shein, which decided to stop shipping any more products to the US earlier this month, and raised prices of some of its most popular products by as much as 30% to generate more cash. “We had some urgent meetings in late March to discuss our next steps. The conclusion was to stop fighting for the US market,” said sales manager Huang Lun. The plight of Chinese exporters mean US consumers could face rising prices and shortages of crucial goods in the coming months. The grim outlook adds to rising bets among economists that the US will enter a recession if the White House doesn’t back down on its tariff threats. China will also endure substantial economic pain. With their largest market on hold, many factories have cut back production to just three or four days per week, said Wang, citing a recent industry survey conducted by the association. With bank loans and worker salaries to pay, there will be a wave of factory closures and worker layoffs in the coming months, she said. Jenny Huang, a salesperson at a Ningbo-based curtain maker, is trying to diversify beyond the US though 90% of its current client base — business that has come to an abrupt halt — is there. The company will only consider exporting to the US again when tariff situation clears up, she says. Until then, it is exploring opportunities elsewhere such as Southeast Asia the Middle East. “When the tariffs were raised to 54%, people already suffered very slim profits but still decided to stay and buy time to explore new markets with the cash flow generated in the US,” said Wang. “But when it was raised to 125% and then 145%, people decided to quit because you’ll die faster if you insist on staying in the US.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Archives Internal variability effect doped by climate change drove the 2023 marine heat extreme in the North Atlantic, Guinaldo et al., Communications Earth & Environment The year 2023 shattered numerous heat records both globally and regionally. We here focus on the drivers of the unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which started in the North Atlantic Ocean in early summer and persisted later on. Evidence is provided that 2023 should be interpreted as an extreme event in a warmer world because of superimposed internal variability on top of human forcing, which altogether, made the 2023 event all-time high due to extreme air-sea surface fluxes in the subtropics and eastern basin. The effect of internal variability has been considerably boosted by the long-term ocean stratification increase due to combined anthropogenically-driven ocean warming and multidecadal variability. The 2023 event would have been impossible to occur without anthropogenically-driven climate change but at the current warmer background climate state, it is assessed as a decadal-type event when considering the full North Atlantic ocean and a centennial event in the subtropics and eastern basin. Considering the regional distribution of anomalies is crucial for risk assessment in a warming climate. Reply to Pielke (2025), Willoughby et al., Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology: Pielke deprecates both the ICAT database, which he once recommended, and U.S. tropical cyclone (TC) damage estimates from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). We do not share these views. Willoughby et al. (hereafter WL24) is based upon ICAT damage for 1900–2017, both then-year and normalized for inflation, population, and individual wealth, extended to 2022 with National Hurricane Center (NHC) official figures from NCEI. Pielke represents the data of Weinkle et al. (hereafter WK18) as a superior source. We find troubling anomalies in the WK18 data. The issue is that WK18 find that normalized TC damage is constant, but WL24 find that it is increasing. Here, we replicate the WL24 analysis with WK18 data and find a statistically significant growth of then-year damage relative to the U.S. economy, a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the most damaging TCs, and a 0.6% per year increase in TC normalized damage. The last of these is not statistically significant because of the large variance due to the modulation of TC impacts by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Thus, the increase in U.S. TC damage is sufficiently robust to survive the shortcomings of both datasets. Discerning the Elevated Risk of Compound Extreme Heat Stress Followed by Extreme Precipitation Events in the Socially Vulnerable Communities in the Upper Midwest, Khan et al., International Journal of Climatology Compound extreme events have the potential to yield severe socio-economic repercussions. This study delves into compound extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress (CEPHS), an aspect that needs more extensive examination within the compound event framework in the upper Midwestern United States. Results reveal a significant increasing trend in CEPHS occurrences, particularly in Kentucky, lower, central, and northern parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, central parts of Missouri, northern parts of Michigan, and western and north-eastern parts of Iowa from 1979 to 2021. Moreover, we observed significantly higher intensities of extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress compared to those occurring independently, predominantly in the central and northern parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio during the same period. Our analysis also underscores a robust association between CEPHS and convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. These insights offer valuable implications for flood hazard management strategies under climate change within the region. This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch project (No. ILLU-741-337). British heatwave discourse (1985–2023): from ice cream to armageddon?, van Dooremalen & Smith, Environmental Sociology: How has public discourse about climate change evolved? This paper answers this question through the paradigmatic case of British heatwaves. These are traditionally considered a fortunate break from dull weather, making them a least likely case for the emergency of a discourse of doom. With a topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127), we show that a longstanding Romantic heatwave discourse eventually buckled, and that Apocalypticism finally became the dominant genre in the last decade. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates and explains complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive lifestyle implications. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. In connecting the genre perspective from literary theory to big data method topic modelling, our approach is parsimonious, novel and replicable in other national contexts. Enhanced flood synchrony and downstream severity in the Delaware River under rising temperatures, Cooper et al., Communications Earth & Environment: River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75th percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.

Title: APP DEADLINE ALERT: AppLovin (APP) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman Before May 5th Deadline in Securities Class Action

April 23, 2025 18:46 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Investors got hosed when Trump’s tariffs tanked markets. Some of America’s billionaires managed to sell before the plunge

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Many of America’s wealthiest business leaders have lost millions, if not billions, of dollars in net worth since the start of the year, as President Donald Trump’s policies hit markets. But some might have lost even more if they hadn’t offloaded millions of dollars’ worth of stock prior to Trump’s tariff announcement in early April — not necessarily because they knew something the rest of us didn’t, but because the wealthiest investors treat their portfolios somewhat differently than the average investor. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle CEO Safra Catz and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon were among the top 10 stock sellers by value during the first three months of this year, according to data from The Washington Service, which tracks buying and selling by corporate insiders. Together, the top 10 insider sellers sold more than 28 million shares of their companies, worth a combined $3.9 billion, during the first quarter, the data shows. That was before markets took a precipitous drop when Trump announced on April 2 widespread tariff hikes on America’s trading partners. Trump has since flip-flopped on many of those tariff plans, but uncertainty has continued to roil markets. Bloomberg first reported on The Washington Service data. Representatives for Zuckerberg and Catz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Dimon said his sale was pre-planned and disclosed months before. Corporate executives generally offload stock at regularly scheduled intervals, and there’s no indication that the top sellers were looking to get ahead of the tariff announcement. Still, the timing meant they suffered smaller losses in the value of their stock holdings than if they had sold weeks later. Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth nearly $733.5 million during the first quarter. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the sales took place during January and February, when Meta shares were mostly trading above $600. As of midday Wednesday, Meta shares (META) were trading around $530, down 11% year-to-date. Related article These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars The decline in Meta’s share price has helped to drag down Zuckerberg’s net worth by nearly $30 billion since the start of this year, as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Even after the sales, Zuckerberg owns more than 342 million shares of Meta, around 13% of the company’s total stock. The decline in Zuckerberg’s wealth this year is particularly striking considering efforts by him and his company to foster a closer relationship with Trump, presumably in hopes that Trump’s policies and actions would benefit his company’s bottom line. That included donating to and attending the president’s inauguration, as well as a $25 million agreement to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library. Catz sold 3.8 million in Oracle shares worth $705 million in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service. Oracle’s stock (ORCL) was down nearly 19% since the start of this year, as of midday Wednesday. JPMorgan’s Dimon sold more than 860,000 shares (JPM) worth $233.8 million in the first quarter. Dimon has warned that a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade policies. The top ten insider sellers based on the value of shares sold in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service, were: Zuckerberg, Catz, Palo Alto Networks CEO Arora Nikesh, Nutanix Director Max de Groen, Axis Capital Holdings Director Charles Davis (sold by Stone Point Capital where Davis is chairman and co-CEO), Palantir President Stephen Cohen, Dimon, Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Dutch Bros Chairman Travis Boersma.

Title: Investors got hosed when Trump’s tariffs tanked markets. Some of America’s billionaires managed to sell before the plunge

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Many of America’s wealthiest business leaders have lost millions, if not billions, of dollars in net worth since the start of the year, as President Donald Trump’s policies hit markets. But some might have lost even more if they hadn’t offloaded millions of dollars’ worth of stock prior to Trump’s tariff announcement in early April — not necessarily because they knew something the rest of us didn’t, but because the wealthiest investors treat their portfolios somewhat differently than the average investor. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle CEO Safra Catz and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon were among the top 10 stock sellers by value during the first three months of this year, according to data from The Washington Service, which tracks buying and selling by corporate insiders. Together, the top 10 insider sellers sold more than 28 million shares of their companies, worth a combined $3.9 billion, during the first quarter, the data shows. That was before markets took a precipitous drop when Trump announced on April 2 widespread tariff hikes on America’s trading partners. Trump has since flip-flopped on many of those tariff plans, but uncertainty has continued to roil markets. Bloomberg first reported on The Washington Service data. Representatives for Zuckerberg and Catz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Dimon said his sale was pre-planned and disclosed months before. Corporate executives generally offload stock at regularly scheduled intervals, and there’s no indication that the top sellers were looking to get ahead of the tariff announcement. Still, the timing meant they suffered smaller losses in the value of their stock holdings than if they had sold weeks later. Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth nearly $733.5 million during the first quarter. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the sales took place during January and February, when Meta shares were mostly trading above $600. As of midday Wednesday, Meta shares (META) were trading around $530, down 11% year-to-date. Related article These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars The decline in Meta’s share price has helped to drag down Zuckerberg’s net worth by nearly $30 billion since the start of this year, as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Even after the sales, Zuckerberg owns more than 342 million shares of Meta, around 13% of the company’s total stock. The decline in Zuckerberg’s wealth this year is particularly striking considering efforts by him and his company to foster a closer relationship with Trump, presumably in hopes that Trump’s policies and actions would benefit his company’s bottom line.

Title: Nvidia, other chipmakers jump on eased tariff concerns

Chip stocks were among the market leaders on Wednesday thanks to President Donald Trump’s statement the day before that tariffs on China “will come down substantially,” as well as vote of confidence by famed investor Cathie Wood. Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought up stock in several chipmakers on Tuesday, including $1.1 million shares of Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday, Nvidia jumped more than 5%, approaching its 21-day moving average. Palintir Technologies (PLTR) also had a strong performance Wednesday, rising more than 7%, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shot up by 10.2% during the day, AMD (AMD) rose 8.1%, Micron (MU) jumped 6.8%, and Broadcom (AVGO) more than 7%. Although semiconductors and other electronics are currently exempt from steep U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, administration officials have said those exemptions are temporary, and tariffs would probably be imposed on the sector in a month or two. Those threats have weighed heavily on chip stocks in recent days, but late Tuesday Trump said those tariffs “will come down substantially” and he intends to be “very nice” to China in trade negotiations. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor sector, was up about 4% in trading on Wednesday.

Title: Google earnings are coming Thursday. Here's what to watch

Time Published: 2025-04-23T19:38:00Z
Full Content:
Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet will report first-quarter 2025 earnings Thursday after the bell in what could be a key test for the Nasdaq, given the company’s heavyweight status on the index. The company’s stock has fallen about 16% so far this year, so investors will be tuning in to Thursday’s earnings call to gauge how exactly how confident Google’s leadership is about the company’s future, particularly in the key areas of AI and cloud computing, and amid a host of legal concerns related to antitrust cases. The shares were up slightly in Thursday morning trading, about 1.3%. Google is expected to report Q1 revenue growth of $89.2 billion (an 11% year-over-year increase) and earnings per share of $2.02 (7% ). Despite the company’s dip in stock price over the past year, Wall Street analysts largely remain optimistic about Google’s future. The consensus? Its core business fundamentals are strong. Still, lingering uncertainties have led some big firms to lower price targets ahead of Thursday’s call. ​Top analysts, such as those at TD Cowen (TD), UBS (UBS), and Scotiabank (BNS), have adjusted their 12-month price targets for Alphabet. TD Cowen reduced its target from $210 to $195, while UBS lowered its from $209 to $173, and Scotiabank dropped its from $232 to $200. But despite these more cautious outlooks, all three firms maintain a “buy” rating on the stock. RBC Capital (RY) analyst Brad Erickson said in a report that institutional investors have lowered their expectations: “We believe buy side is expecting a (2%-3%) miss, respectively, relative to sell-side estimates of 9% search growth and 8% overall ad growth in Q1.” Google is dealing with a host of swirling questions that analysts are taking into consideration: rising legal risks, trade war and tariff uncertainty, and increasing competition in AI and cloud computing. For investors, the first-quarter earnings report could be a moment of truth: a chance to reset expectations and refocus on the long-term potential of a $1.9 trillion Silicon Valley giant navigating turbulent waters. Google has gotten plenty of headlines lately as it wades its way through a variety of antitrust lawsuits. The search engine giant was back in court this week, related to a ruling that found the company has an illegal monopoly in online search — in part by paying web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to feature its search engine. And the DOJ told the judge it had an eyebrow-raising solution: forcing the company to sell its popular Chrome browser. Google faces other mounting issues that have put the company in an especially vulnerable position. In a separate antitrust case, a federal judge ruled that the company had illegally maintained a monopoly in some of its online advertising technology, which could result in regulatory fines or structural changes to how Google’s ad business operates — and maybe even a break-up. And Japan’s FTC recently sent the company a cease-and-desist order after it said Google’s search practices were monopolistic. On Thursday, analysts will watch closely for any mention of these legal challenges and for what the company’s strategy is for dealing with them beyond what the company has already said — that they’ll appeal. One key feature of Google’s earnings report will likely be how the company has integrated and improved its AI offerings, especially among increased competition in the realm. Investors will look at how the company’s Gemini AI model has been integrated across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud — and at how the AI will start generating substantial revenue. Jeffries analysts said that Google Cloud is “well positioned to benefit from Gemini AI advances” as the cloud computing suite remains a bit of a highlight for the company. Analysts expect Q1 Google Cloud revenue of almost $12 billion, up 25% year-over-year and slightly below both the Street’s expectation ($12.3 billion) and Q4’s growth rate (30%). However, Google Cloud is still playing catch-up to rivals such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN) and Microsoft Azure (MSFT). Google has positioned Google Cloud as an AI-first platform, so as more businesses adopt AI technologies, Google hopes to position its software as the go-to provider. If this quarter’s earnings show significant cloud growth, it could signal a breakthrough moment. Analysts will be closely watching for any signs that this strategy has begun to pay off. And analysts will be looking at AI search competition, too, which JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth said in a report “remains front and center given the rapidly growing scale of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s more measured pace in disrupting its own search ecosystem.” Google’s advertising business remains the biggest component of the company’s revenue, so investors will look at those numbers to shed light on the current state of the digital advertising market. YouTube and Google Search, the pillars of the company’s ad revenue, are expected to show growth. Analysts predict YouTube’s ad revenue will rise nearly 11% to almost $8 billion. But the company has big hopes for expansion in YouTube Shorts monetization. If it becomes a significant revenue stream, it could help offset any potential slowdown in traditional ad revenue. Analysts remain cautious. Legal challenges, including the recent ruling in federal court that found Google guilty of illegally dominating the market in ad servers and exchanges, could have big implications.

April 23, 2025 14:22 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Title: Amazon Stock’s $200 Billion Tariff Hit
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/23/amazon-stocks-200-billion-tariff-hit/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T16:52:07Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. HANOVER, GERMANY - MARCH 31: The AWS Amazon Web Services pavilion stands are seen at the 2025 ... More Hannover Messe industrial trade fair on March 31, 2025 in Hanover, Germany. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Think AI spending is Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) biggest risk? Think again. The real time bomb is tariffs - and it’s already ticking. Amazon hauls in over $400 billion in retail-related revenue every year. And here’s the kicker: roughly 25% of its cost of goods sold comes from China. Now layer on Trump’s renewed tariffs and suddenly you’re staring at a $6.5 billion operating income hit that could erase almost $200 billion in market cap, based on Amazon’s current 30x multiple. Tariffs will hit Amazon where it hurts most: razor-thin retail margins. And it doesn’t stop there. If consumers balk at price hikes, Amazon’s pricing power erodes. If sellers bail, Prime loses its edge. If margins compress further - while the company pours billions into AI with no proven ROI - the entire bull case starts to wobble. We warned about this in our recent piece: Amazon Stock to Crash to $120? Tariffs are the spark. AI overspend is the fuel. And if you’re still all-in on Amazon stock, it might be time to rethink. That’s why our High-Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep these stock-specific shocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s unpack the damage by the numbers. Amazon sells everything but it doesn’t make everything. It sources much of its inventory and enables a third-party ecosystem that’s deeply reliant on Chinese manufacturing. With the tariff war escalating with China, Amazon’s cost base is now exposed in a major way. Amazon lives and dies by its value proposition. That makes it terrible at passing on cost increases. But it has to, to some degree. CEO Andy Jassy himself admitted that “Prices will likely rise” due to tariffs - a rare public concession of pricing pressure. But let’s be clear: Amazon will eat much of these costs. Unlike niche DTC brands or retailers with premium margins, Amazon competes on price, and every dollar it fails to pass through is a direct hit to margins. Let’s do the math based on Amazon’s 2024 financials Now assume: Does it look small? Think again. That’s a $200 billion decline in stock value. Market Cap Hit > $200 Billion Just 1% decline in operating margin reduces Amazon’s value by $200 billion based on prevailing P/EBIT multiple of almost 30x. That’s >10% of current market cap. Just double that margin hit, which is quite possible (remember reciprocal tariffs are at a ridiculous number now) and you are easily looking at 20-25% downside. But that’s not all. Guess what? When expectations fall, multiples shrink. Amazon’s current market multiples inherently imply that investors expect margin expansion. And when that does not happen - and in fact margins go down - what do you think is going to happen? Big funds will dump Amazon, and multiples will contract. The actual downside could be much higher! It is not outrageous to say that Amazon can fall even as low as $120. Just look at the history - market doesn’t care how good the business is. This is why we diversify away stock-specific risks with Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

More Martin, Matt Duffer, Kate Trefry, Sonia Friedman, Bela Bajaria, Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy and Blair Fetter attend Stranger Things: The First Shadow - Broadway Opening Night at Marquis Theatre on April 22, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Netflix) The market is a mess. April has already seen the S&P 500 tumble nearly 6%, and most high-flying tech names are getting dragged down with it. Except one. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is up a jaw-dropping 11.6% this month. Yes, you read that right. While the broader market is coughing up gains, Netflix is popping champagne. And this kind of divergence is exactly why we don’t bet the farm on any one stock. Because when single names zig while everything else zags, the upside can be thrilling - but the risk? Blistering. That’s why our High-Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep these exact stock-specific shocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception So what’s going on? Let’s dig in and check whether this red-hot rally is actually justified or is it about to hit the pause button? Call it earnings magic or just really good timing, but Netflix did well in Q1 2025. Here are the numbers that got Wall Street giddy: And all this as the rest of tech stumbles around blaming tariffs and macro gloom. Netflix? They’re cruising. The company pulled this off by raising prices (again), expanding its advertising tier with in-house tech, and - believe it or not - finally making live content and sports work. This is the part where people start whispering about Netflix being a “tariff-proof haven.” They’re not entirely wrong - Netflix doesn’t sell sneakers or iPhones. No China imports. No tariff drama. Just subscription dollars rolling in. Let’s not sugarcoat this: Netflix stock is expensive at a P/E ratio of 45 and P/EBIT ratio of just under 40. That’s certainly above where most value investors feel cozy. If you are saying - “well that’s fine, Netflix has been a high PE stock for years” - you’d be half right. Think again. In 2022 when inflation hit - guess where Netflix P/E landed? It hit rock bottom of 15x! That’s even lower than what most mature companies get. Simply put - there is ample room for multiple contraction. When that happens, stocks crater. PE is a sensitive metric. It is fueled by expectations. Sure things look good for now because Netflix is executing. Margins are up. Growth is still good. And it’s one of the few mega-cap names that doesn’t have to worry about tariffs, supply chains, or China risk. Investors are looking for safe havens in a shaky macro environment. Right now, Netflix is playing the part equivalent to gold. But you can’t ignore the price tag. This is a stock that assumes Netflix will keep crushing it. Is that possible? Sure. Is it guaranteed? Absolutely not. And here is some data as caution: Netflix is a rare beast in today’s market: a growth stock that’s not just surviving but thriving. But thriving doesn’t come cheap. With a P/E of 45 and little room for missteps, Netflix may be one earnings miss or subscriber slip away from a sharp reality check. The risk here isn’t about Netflix falling apart - it's about the market’s sky-high expectations crashing down to earth. And that’s the problem with chasing single-stock hype: when they win, it’s exhilarating. But when they stumble? Painful. Considering multiples in context of growth is one of the factors we look at in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Happening With Palantir Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. POLAND - 2024/11/21: In this photo illustration, the Palantir company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) S&P is down 6% in April. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is up 11%? That’s not bullish. That’s bizarre, considering the numbers you see when you lift the curtain. Tariffs are hammering tech, semiconductors are shaking, growth stocks are bleeding, and Palantir - a stock trading at PE multiple of 700 is rising? Either we’re witnessing brilliance or a bubble inflating before our eyes. And bubbles pop. When they do, you don’t want to be left holding nothing. This is why investing in a single stock, no matter how lucrative, can be very risky. We diversify away that risk while being exposed to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break Palantir down. It’s not fundamentals driving this. It’s euphoria supercharged by three powerful story lines: [1] AI Buzz = Investor Sugar High Palantir calls itself an “AI company” now. That label alone triggers algos and retail fear-of-missing-out. Still, AI hype alone can send any ticker vertical. Just ask C3.ai - that reached highs of $180+ before falling to a mere $10. [2] Insane Momentum: The Stock is Up Almost 700% in 3 Years Palantir has returned 686% in the past 3 years. That’s the kind of move that breaks valuation anchors. People stop asking “what’s it worth?” and start asking “how high can it go?” [3] Retail Crowd Favorite Palantir is a retail darling - with a CEO (Alex Karp) who talks like a philosopher and a cult-like following that sees it as the next Palantir-for-planet-earth operating system. But sentiment isn’t a moat. And it isn’t a reason to buy. Palantir bulls love to talk about potential. But here’s what the data actually says: There are times to ride such momentum, but in the case of Palantir, that time is gone. Valuation multiples mean something. Evaluating multiples in the context of growth and margin expansion is one of the factors we consider in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Update font size. Reset Wall Street’s major indexes surged to one-week highs on Wednesday, driven by optimism for a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war and President Donald Trump’s softened stance on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Hopes of talks between Washington and Beijing, amid the tariff conflict, boosted market sentiment following a Wall Street Journal report quoting a senior White House official, who suggested U.S. tariffs on China could drop to around 50%-60%. President Trump said on Tuesday of China, “We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” and that tariffs on goods from China will “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” He also told reporters he would be “very nice” in negotiations with Beijing and that if China does not agree to a trade deal, “the U.S. will set the terms.” Reuters: ‎ Stocks extended gains after the report, building on early momentum after Trump said on Tuesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell, walking back on his comment that the Fed chair’s termination could not come “fast enough” that had drawn heavy criticism. Markets welcomed the change in the president’s tone. Trump’s criticism of the Fed chair had fueled concerns about the central bank’s autonomy, leading to sharp losses in U.S. assets, including stocks and the dollar, earlier in the week. Megacap tech stocks rose broadly, with Nvidia gaining 5.1%. Apple and Meta Platforms rose 3.6% and 6.7%, respectively… The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 12 new lows. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Axing Jerome “Months Late” Powell, Mr. Transitory, before his end date on May 15, 2026 would be a good thing for Wall Street, but the economy and the stock market will survive 12 months of yet another feckless, often-wrong Fed Chair. As we wrote in February 2023, “When certain quarters, including the Fed, delude themselves and others that ‘inflation is transitory’ and waste at least a year before doing a mere portion of what is necessary* (interest rate hikes), the price will be paid for being delusional and late.” ‘Tis best to get a handle on inflation, if you know how, while you still can. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2021 *Stop the misguided crusade against domestic energy production and profligate federal spending and inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks. It’s not difficult. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2022 For new generations, sometimes tough lessons have to be retaught and learned the hard way. As we go through this, remember: It’s always darkest before the dawn. – MacDailyNews, July 14, 2022 After drifting around aimlessly for far too long on the U.S.S. Transitory, the delusional Fed is laughably too little, too late. Catching up will be difficult. – MacDailyNews, September 13, 2022 Inflation is repudiation. — Calvin Coolidge When a business or an individual spends more than it makes, it goes bankrupt. When government does it, it sends you the bill… [which] comes in two ways: higher taxes and inflation.

Title: Nvidia investors should watch out for this key risk that could trigger a double-digit semiconductor stock plunge in the next 12 months

It's been a rough few months for investors who bought into the AI trade last year. If general recession fears and a trade war stifling the chip industry weren't enough bad news, investment research company BCA Research is ringing the alarm bell on an even bigger risk: a full-blown war between the US and China over Taiwan. In a recent report by two of the firm's strategists, Marko Papic and Matt Gertken, BCA Research doubled the odds of a full-scale conflict between the two countries in the next 12 months from 5% to 10%. While most Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs have been paused, the tariff rate on Chinese goods remains at a whopping 145%. And while Trump on Wednesday announced plans to soften his stance against China, no concrete details about deescalating tariffs have been released. "President Trump has just raised tariffs to levels that, if sustained, will halt US-China trade. Combined with export controls, looming investment restrictions, and various other existing or threatened sanctions, the US strategy will start to look like an all-out economic war against Beijing," Papic and Gertken wrote. "That would give Chinese policymakers significant domestic cover for retaliation that goes beyond trade." Essentially, Trump's tough negotiating tactics have put the US at an elevated risk of war by backing China into an economic corner, and China might have enough at stake to incite a military conflict, BCA Research believes. US GDP growth is highly dependent on consumer activity, but that's not the case for China. While roughly two-thirds of the US economy consists of consumption expenditures, China's is 39%, making it more reliant on exports to grow its economy. Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, recently echoed similar concerns around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. "The Chinese economy is much more vulnerable than is the US economy to a trade war between the two superpowers," Yardeni wrote in a note last week. "President Xi might conclude that now is a good time to invade Taiwan since Trump has played his tariff card and Xi needs a diversion from the calamity about to befall his economy." BCA Research sees another 25% chance of a small-scale proxy war breaking out, for a cumulative 35% probability of some sort of geopolitical conflict playing out in the next 12 months. Taiwan plays a critical role in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips that tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD depend on. If China feels threatened by Trump's tariff policy, it could retaliate by either blockading or invading Taiwan, cutting off vital resources for American companies. In the worst-case scenario, which BCA Research has dubbed "WWIII," expect to see a severe economic impact from a military conflict between the US and China. The firm predicts the S&P 500 would take a 40% hit in such a situation, led by plunges in semiconductor giants like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. "Much of Taiwan's most precious fixed asset investments — including its prized semiconductor fabs — would be destroyed by Taiwan itself or the US as Chinese forces approached, thus defeating the technological benefit of unification," Papic and Gertken wrote. In the case of a proxy war, such as if China launches a partial invasion on Taiwan, BCA Research predicts a 10% drawdown to the S&P 500. Investors shouldn't worry too much over the possibility of an all-out military conflict — BCA Research estimates there's a 65% chance that the status quo will prevail. But the fringe case's impact on markets is highly devastating and worth hedging against, Papic and Gertken believe. "Investors should consider deep out-of-the-money insurance against a calamitous event," wrote Papic and Gertken. "For example, bets on large double-digit declines in Taiwanese stocks, or TSMC or NVDA share prices." As an example, let's say Nvidia stock is trading at $100. If you're concerned about a military escalation that would seriously disrupt the company's business model, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $70 that expires in 12 months. Since $70 is far below the current price, the option will be deep out-of-the-money and cheap. In the worst-case scenario, you'll be able to sell Nvidia for $70 if the stock price dips below that level. The option itself also becomes more valuable, and can be sold for a profit. If the stock doesn't plunge, your options will expire and you'll forfeit the cost of the options, but it's a small price to pay for insurance, Papic and Gertken said. "Investors should buy insurance against this tail risk while it is cheap," they wrote. Another way to hedge against the US-China trade war is to increase your allocation to emerging market manufacturing companies, BCA recommended. Examples of emerging market funds include the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Unsurprisingly, gold is another trusty hedge against geopolitical risk. BCA predicts the yellow metal will see a 40% boost in the case a full military conflict breaks out, and 10% in the case of a proxy war. Investors can get exposure to gold through funds like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU). Get the latest Gold price here. Jump to

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker. Tesla Valuation Metrics Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73. Tesla 12 Month Price Targets Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies’ position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla’s innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months. Tesla Number of Guru Trades The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels. Tesla Insider Buys and Sells Volume That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology.

Title: Elon Musk Gets $10 Billion Richer As Tesla Stock Rallies On ‘Mea Culpa’ —Despite Brutal Earnings

Time Published: 2025-04-23T13:50:41Z
Full Content:
The world’s richest person got much richer Wednesday as shares of Elon Musk’s car company Tesla soared following the company’s first-quarter earnings update—which offered little encouragement in its traditional financial results, but gave investors what they long yearned for: Musk recommitting to Tesla after months of paying his near undivided attention to the White House. Elon Musk attends a White House cabinet meeting in February. Musk’s net worth climbed $7.5 billion to $369.2 billion Wednesday, according to our latest calculations, extending his lead over the next wealthiest person, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, to $170 billion. The spike came as shares of Tesla shot up 5% to $251 in response to its late Tuesday Q1 report, which was ugly by most metrics, as profits and revenues both came in below consensus forecasts at multiyear lows. Tesla certainly got a boost from a broader rally tied to President Donald Trump’s relenting on his China trade standoff and his threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell – the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 3% – but the rally largely came as Musk confirmed his dedication to Tesla. “Mea culpa Elon” was the tone struck by the Tesla chief on the earnings call, remarked Evercore ISI analysts led by Chris McNally, as Musk said he’ll be “allocating far more” of his time to the company starting next month. That was music to the ears of many investors and analysts who had expressed concerns about the extensive time Musk spent as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – and the associated damage to Tesla’s brand as Musk’s outspoken politics rubbed many potential customers the wrong way. In addition to Musk’s rededication to Tesla, also helping catalyze the stock rally were the confirmation of June launch plans for the driverless “robotaxi” and the beginning of production of lower-cost electric vehicles during the first half of this year, according to Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so,” Musk said during Tuesday’s earnings call. Musk described Tesla as the “least affected car company” by Trump’s tariffs, but the senior advisor to the president again made clear he disagrees with Trump on his signature trade policy. “I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity,” said Musk, continuing the tariff “decision is fundamentally up to” Trump. “So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,” shrugged Musk. Tesla stock is still down almost 40% year-to-date, far worse than the S&P 500’s 8% decline as Trump’s oft-changing tariffs led to increased concerns of a recession. Musk donated $288 million toward Trump election causes, making him the largest political donor of the 2024 election cycle. Musk’s role as the head of DOGE, in which he oversaw cost-cutting efforts including mass federal government layoffs, brought significant backlash to Tesla, as sales slumped globally as protests and vandalism spread. In addition to his roles at DOGE and Tesla, Musk is also the CEO of aerospace giant SpaceX, generative AI startup xAI and several other companies. Tesla faced a “code red” situation if Musk didn’t recommit to the company, warned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ahead of earnings. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Trans rights supporters march in London after the UK Supreme Court’s anti-trans ruling. The UK Supreme Court’s transphobic ruling on the definition of “woman” last week is a defeat for all women—even, ultimately, the self-described feminists celebrating it, and the women who will gain in the short term from their alliance with the carceral state. Following the ruling, J.K. Rowling, the world’s richest author and perhaps its most prominent transphobe, tweeted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and a bourbon on her $15 million superyacht, toasting what she called “TERF VE Day,” in reference to the acronym “trans-exclusionary radical feminism” and the surrender of German military operations that heralded “Victory in Europe” 80 years ago. “I love it when a plan comes together,” Rowling added. Rowling had a very particular reason to celebrate; she personally bankrolled the legal campaign by the anti-trans group For Women Scotland that led to the Supreme Court decision. But she was not alone; all over the world, Rowling’s fellow cisfeminist activists popped champagne and congratulated themselves on “reality winning,” imagining themselves, too, perhaps, to be victorious powers in World War II, triumphant over fascism. Try as they might to wrap themselves in the antifascist flag, though, these activists are hailing a decision that represents a ghoulish culmination of fascistic “family values” agitation in women’s name—something it achieves by stomping on a tiny, ultra-vulnerable minority. This is nothing new, either; for over two decades, at the highest levels of Britain’s state and cultural establishment, the articulation of cissexist policy has flowed not only from antifeminist politicians’ lips but also from trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs), who have used every conceivable queerphobic and fascist trope against trans women—pervert, groomer, pedophile, fetishist, rapist, barbarian, deceiver, interloper, parasite—to achieve their end. The Supreme Court’s 88-page judgment declares that trans women whose affirmed gender had been legally recognized by the UK government will no longer be considered women under existing equality laws. Suddenly, in other words, the document that someone living in that country has used for the past 21 years to secure the state’s recognition of their (changed) sex—“for all purposes”—no longer applies in many segregated contexts such as sports, hospital wards, and university accommodation. It no longer protects trans dignity on public boards, either, which is what the For Women Scotland appeal was originally about: The court, in its own words, was considering “whether the appointment of a trans woman with a GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] counts as the appointment of a woman.” Last Wednesday, Lord Patrick Hodge, deputy president of the Supreme Court, announced that no, trans women don’t count. Trans people make up roughly half a percent of Britain’s population, and only a tiny fraction of them—about 9,000—have acquired the aforementioned certificate since it was made available in 2004 following the passage of the country’s Gender Recognition Act. But the ruling now elevates them to the status of an existential threat. Astonishingly, the ruling specifies that what it calls “women living in the male gender”—i.e., trans men, and cis women whose appearance is deemed masculine—“could also be excluded” alongside cis men, from women’s spaces. “Not being allowed into the mens by rule does not mean you have the right to go into the ladies,” clarified the leading anti-trans campaigner Maya Forstater; “That may seem unfair, but these are life choices people make. If you make extreme efforts to look like a man don’t be surprised if you are denied entrance to ladies.” Forstater’s comments underscore the ultimate goal of TERFs and other transphobes: to expunge trans people from public life. Predictably, the all-white, majority-male panel of judges, who heard from no trans people or groups at all in connection with the case, insist that their destruction of trans women’s legal standing qua women vis-à-vis the UK Equality Act is not a defeat for the trans community at all. Trans people in Britain are still protected as trans people by a separate provision in the Equality Act, so the apologists argue; thus, no one loses. But given that institutions are already scrambling to impose penalties on all and any persons suspected of trespassing on the “wrong” side of sex-segregated facilities—if for whatever reason they cannot, or will not, provide proof of assigned sex at birth—it’s unclear to me if anyone really believes this. The fact, already now, is this: If I am perceived not to be what I say I am, and I don’t have the relevant documents, I can be strip-searched by male transport police, and legally barred from single-sex spaces. Trans people will, of course, continue to live lives of authenticity, but make no mistake: Everyone’s bodily autonomy is curtailed (especially those of us who, cis or trans, are poor, undocumented, racialized, intersex, gender non-conforming) by the cisfeminist diktat against non-cis humanity’s existence in public. The decades-long coordinated attack on trans rights paves the way for the unraveling of the Equality Act as a whole, and the dismantling of every (limited but important) legislative gain for social justice achieved since 1998’s explosive “Lawrence Inquiry” into institutional and police racism in the UK. The playbook is now all set to merge with the American one “defending women against gender ideology extremism” (per the White House’s executive order of January, which seeks to make human sexuation, as it were, great again). Hitherto, to suggest as much has typically incurred incandescent indignation on the part of feminism’s Brexiteers—the self-styled anti-woke left-liberal single-issue cissexists whose reactionary brand has long been hegemonic in the UK. This camp has long promoted itself as profoundly un-American. But, increasingly, its hatred of the Black, abolitionist, gender-abundant, utopian international left supersedes its patriotism, leading it to align itself with MAGA (unlikely inheritor of the “true” feminism the left abandoned) without shame. The rationale offered for the retraction of trans people’s right to be men and women in society (rather than un-men and un-women) boils down to the word “biology.” Yet the word does not appear in the Equality Act, and the judge explicitly declines to define it, declaring that the “biological characteristics” corresponding to the “plain and unambiguous words [‘man’ and ‘woman’] are assumed to be self-explanatory and to require no further explanation.” As the archivist Morgan Page summarized it acidly, “apparently the UK Supreme Court will know women when they see them,” this being the litmus test for pornography put forward by the US Supreme Court in the 1960s. The comparison to obscenity law is no idle one. “Deep in the judgment,” noted the barrister Dave Renton, “is an idea of trans people as moral contaminants.” For half a century, the drive to purify womanhood of perversity has indeed undergirded the minority branch of Anglo American women’s liberationism that, in 2008, was dubbed “TERF.” (A better label than “TERFism,” in my view, would have been “cisfeminism” or “cultural feminism,” since there really is nothing radical about the ideology, even though it is feminist.) One lurid antecedent of the feminist misogyny—yes!—at the heart of TERFism is the ecofeminist theologian Mary Daly’s femmephobic 1978 screed Gyn/Ecology: the Meta-Ethics of Radical Feminism, which pours infinitely more contempt on femininity and “artificiality” than it does on patriarchy. Expounded via lynch mob–esque interventions in lesbian spaces by figures like Sheila Jeffreys in England and Robin Morgan in the United States, this fringe feminism was considered reactionary by most radical feminists already in 1973. Preferring the term “gender-critical,” 21st-century TERFs have protested for years that TERF is a misogynistic slur; still, the more of British society they’ve captured, the more they’ve grown content with the moniker. “Welcome to Team TERF,” gloats UnHerd every time an A-lister turns transphobe. “2023 is the year of the TERF,” declares the far-right rally Let Women Speak. “We will fight,” jokes Rowling in another revealing effort to claim Churchillian glory for her cause, “on the beaches of TERF Island.” The copious “strong borders” imagery readily reveals TERFism to be a female cultural nationalism or sexual nationalism, premised—Brexit-style—on the securitization of the tacitly white and innocent body politic against dysgenic gender “refugees.” The pogrom-inciting tenor of what has been called “the trans debate” was normalized from the get-go by feminism’s moral alibi and the nepotism of Britain’s commentariat class. The hyper-respectability of many of its ringleaders surely didn’t hurt, either. Helen Joyce, one of the most influential trans-annihilationists currently heralding the Supreme Court decision as a personal win, is a former editor at The Economist. Her buddy the celebrity anti-trans philosopher Kathleen Stock is a royally honored academic. Rowling, of course, is a national treasure. Meanwhile, the publishing industry has glutted itself on trans-“skeptic” books just asking questions—not just by Joyce and Stock—and these all receive rave reviews in the UK Guardian. (Back in 2018, the US office of that newspaper was even moved to denounce its British counterpart over its participation in the self-styled “feminist” moral panic.) The riddle of “TERF Island” continues to intrigue those international onlookers who intuit feminism and transphobia to be opposites. Unlike the supposedly very different—crassly “polarized” and “partisan”—makeup of the American fight for trans rights, in Britain it’s a point of pride that genteelly genocidal anti-gender-ism cuts across Conservative, Labour, and feminist milieus. (Right on cue, the Labour government hailed the Supreme Court decision, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “really pleased” with the “clarity” it provided, and his spokesperson saying that Starmer no longer believes that trans women are women.) Hearteningly, on Saturday, the UK also saw widespread gigantic anti-TERF protests of the Supreme Court decision, suggesting some degree of popular rejection of the cissexist “common sense” that was explicitly deployed in the court. This epistemic pseudo-realism that we nowadays so often see violently invoked by figures as superficially disparate as J.K. Rowling and D.J. Trump—on matters ranging from woman-definition to immigration—is, to borrow from the historian Ann Stoler, a colonial common sense. This is also paradoxically why TERFism, like all fascist discourses and all imperial and settler-colonial horizons, imagines itself upside-down, as somehow preyed-upon, bullied, colonized, and at risk of genocidal erasure at the hands of the subjugated group it dehumanizes. More pressing matters than metaphysical and/or state recognition of one’s sex often preoccupy individuals in the trans community. The core scourges of trans life in the UK include: poverty, medical under-service, labor market exclusions, sexual violence, housing discrimination, and a media climate of brutal mockery, scapegoating, and stigma. Conversely, in the baseless narrative propagated via the British establishment’s long-standing hate fest around trans-ness, trans women constitute a powerful, sinister sexual threat to ladies, lesbians, and little boys and girls, all of whom are at the mercy of this phantasmic social plague of predatory and fetishistic “men” brandishing pieces of paper that falsely declare them female so as to access “single-sex spaces” where they don’t belong and carry out all manner of evil. (Trans men were usually, until now, an afterthought in TERF politics: harmless at best, traitors to womankind at worst. Thanks to For Women Scotland, though, they might not be able to legally pee in public at all.) In the multifaceted fight against fascism ahead of us, many voices will be raised to re-explain at length, again and again, why trans women are women and trans men are men. Debunking the bad sexological science that well-spoken eugenicists like Helen Joyce propound is certainly a worthwhile task, since it often dazzles the uninitiated and gives pause to the uncertain. But the more important priority, for my money, remains the refusal of TERFs’ very terrain of argument. Ned Resnikoff Books & the Arts / Nathan Taylor Pemberton Kate Wagner StudentNation / Christopher Malley and Nathaniel Moses Feminism does not, and has never, in fact, required a definition of “woman.” To the contrary, while “enemy feminisms” (as I call them) have repeatedly attempted to ontologize and naturalize sex, other feminisms, over the centuries, have pursued the struggle against sexual hierarchy as an all-encompassing utopian endeavor whose present and future constituencies are necessarily moot: Much of revolutionary feminism, for example, remains agnostic about whether “women” will definitely exist after patriarchy, especially given how many female subjects—Indigenous, enslaved, disabled, queer, sex-working—have been excluded from womanhood in the past. Cisness brutalizes us all. The border guards of sex are the enemies of human liberation, and we fight them best by refusing to debate the fairness, let alone the accuracy, of their borders in the first place. “Womanhood is not assigned. It is lived, sacred, and sovereign,” as the joint statement by the Muslim-led feminist Transfuturist and Ad’iyah collectives following the Supreme Court ruling reminds us. “We do not and will never recognize the authority of any government court or institution to determine our legitimacy. They do not know us—and they can never name us.” Update: This piece originally said that the Supreme Court panel that issued the ruling was all-male. In fact, it was majority-male. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: US FTC Sues Uber For Charging Its Customers Without Consent
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/04/223-us-ftc-uber-customers-consent/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T12:30:27Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The United States (US) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing application Uber on April 21 for allegedly charging customers for its Uber One subscription service, without their consent. The regulator has also argued that Uber failed to deliver on its promise of discounts and savings as part of Uber One. The ride-hailing app also allegedly made cancellation difficult despite stating that users can cancel the subscription anytime. To cancel Uber One, customers have to go through 12 different actions and go through âa maze of at least seven screens, if they guess the right paths to use, despite there being no mention of cancellation until the fourth screen.â FTC details that Uber auto-renews Uber One subscriptions and removes the cancellation button for the first 48 hours of the billing period. Even if the customer contacts customer service, the companyâs representatives take too long to process cancellation requests. This leads to the customer incurring a subscription renewal charge once again. The company enrolled customers into Uber One through a variety of ways, including push notifications, pop-ups in the Uber App and the Uber Eats App, and so on. Through push notifications, it offers people savings on their next ride or food delivery. FTC claims that one such offer the company often presents to its customers is 50% off a one-year membership, and when a customer tries to claim the offer, the company offers the service for free. âOnce consumers click the ‘Try for free’ button, they are immediately enrolled in Uber One and will be charged within four weeks, and on a recurring basis thereafter,â the FTC says. It emphasises that in none of these situations does the customer actively provide billing information for this subscription; instead, the company relies on the details it has stored if the customer has ever taken a ride with Uber. The FTC mentions that even before the four-week trial period ends, the company charges customers for the Uber One subscription. Further, if a customer is able to successfully cancel their free trial during the trial period, they immediately lose access to Uber One instead of losing access on the end date of the trial period. When the customer gets to the screen where they can cancel their subscription, Uber requires them to fill out a survey about the reason for cancellation. Till the customer clicks on one of the pre-specified answers to the survey question, it does not allow them to continue to cancel. If the customer clicks an answer and presses continue, a screen appears asking the customer if they want to consider pausing the membership instead. On this page, at the bottom of the page, a button labeled âPause Uber Oneâ appears prominently in a bright gray textbox, while beneath it is a button labeled âNo thanksâ in a subdued black textbox with white font. FTC specifies that neither of these buttons mention cancellation.Â âFurther, these buttons are flipped from their placement on the previous screen: On the previous screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is on the top, whereas, on this screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is now on the bottom. This design interface steers the consumer who wishes to cancel away from the action they are trying to take,â the FTC emphasises. Just like the US, in India as well, customers are facing the menace of dealing with allegedly deceptive practices. According to a survey by the consumer community platform LocalCircles, eight out of ten users have encountered dark patterns on ride-hailing services like Ola and Uber. These are deceptive practices that mislead customers into doing things they did not intend to do. Local Circles found that 78% of customers face higher waiting times than what the ride-hailing apps state on their service.Â âWe are glad to learn that the FTC has come down against the use of Dark Patterns by Uber. CCPA [Central Consumer Protection Agency] must take action on similar dark patterns concerns raised by consumers in India against taxi aggregators,â Sachin Taparia, Founder of LocalCircles, told MediaNama. Notably, in December last year, the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi, took stock of the reports surrounding ride-hailing apps charging people differently based on whether they booked rides through an Android or Apple device. He said that such differential pricing was prima facie an unfair trade practice, and that he has instructed the CCPA to examine price discrepancies in ride-hailing as well as other sectors.

Title: Rural Trump Voters Won’t Regret Their Vote Until Democrats Fight for Them

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Trump promised to address the opioid epidemic and restore small towns to health and prosperity. The president has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. The damage done just in the Trump administration’s first three months could fill the National Archives—assuming that department still exists. Many of those moves, including the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran gulag, have been cruel and utterly unjust. Yet public support for Trump, though declining, remains stubbornly high among rural and working-class people. Some part of that support comes from his ability to couch everything he does as retaliation against liberal elites and a blow against the “rigged system” those elites helped create—a system that has undermined the values and livelihoods of ordinary working people. What will it take to stop Trump? It’s hard to predict how many of the people who supported Trump will turn against him because of the deportation of Garcia, student activists, and others. Those fights absolutely must continue and, we hope, will awaken more and more Americans to the dismantling of democracy. But there will always be those who are moved more by negative impacts to their daily lives. Job loss, hospital and school closures, a huge spike in the cost of essential goods—these are perennial deal-breakers that outlive the daily news cycle. As we suggested in our February column, reacting negatively to every radical idea Trump tosses out only solidifies the left’s position as defenders of the establishment—the very system tens of millions of Americans blame for their woes. We also believe that protesting the bad stuff only gets us so far, and that a positive vision for bettering the lives of rural and working people must be front and center. That said, when it does come to complaining loudly about the impact of Trump’s chaotic nihilism, we should focus on actions that have hurt large numbers of people, many of whom voted for Trump. We need to empathize with and acknowledge their struggles and help channel it into buyers’ remorse: “Trump has betrayed us” gets to the heart of the matter, whereas “Hands off!” smacks of a desire to restore the status quo. To stop Trump and reverse the assault on our economy and democracy, we need to redeploy some of our outrage to highlight how Trump’s actions are actually making the rigged system worse for the folks who put him in office: farmers, small businesses, coal miners, factory and blue-collar workers, consumers struggling with high prices and debt. Until our protest routinely includes the betrayal of folks like these, we have almost no chance of building the broad resistance coalition needed to reverse the disastrous course we’re on. With that in mind, we offer a few examples of Trump’s betrayals of rural and working-class people that we urge the left to prioritize, while also highlighting policies that will reverse those betrayals. Farmers, a core constituency for Trump, have been among the worst hit by his actions since taking office. For midsize and larger farmers, tariffs have prompted widespread anxiety that they are being squeezed from both ends: They’re facing higher costs on inputs like Canadian potash and steel for agricultural equipment, combined with a potentially dramatic loss of markets for soybeans, pork, and other commodities. On top of that, the dismantling of USAID amounts to nearly $2 billion in lost sales for US farmers. For smaller farmers, the termination of the Farm to School program and the Local Food Purchase Program for food banks have eliminated more than $1 billion in markets for fresh produce, while undermining the effort to provide healthy food to kids and people in need. And for farmers of all sizes, the suspension of contractual payments to farmers who’ve undertaken conservation, soil building, renewable energy, and other improvements to their farms is devastating. At least 30,000 of these farmers, who each expended tens of thousands of dollars based on USDA commitments, now find themselves in debt, unclear whether the promised reimbursements will ever materialize. But farmers aren’t the only rural folks getting screwed. Workers and small-business owners are increasingly worried about their livelihoods. Even before the latest round of tariffs, small-business confidence had declined for all three months of Trump’s presidency, with just one in five small business owners saying they expect sales and business conditions to improve in the near future. That uncertainty translates to less investment and hiring on the part of existing small businesses, and fewer new business start-ups. For workers in bigger companies, the surge in union organizing seen under the Biden administration is running into a wall of anti-worker actions from Trump. These include the firing of pro-worker members of the NLRB such as Jennifer Abruzzo, replaced by Crystal Carey, a lawyer whose firm represents notoriously anti-union Tesla and Amazon. Trump has also eliminated the $17 hourly minimum-wage requirement for federal contractors while working to completely dismantle unions representing federal workers. Ned Resnikoff Kate Wagner Books & the Arts / Nathan Taylor Pemberton StudentNation / Christopher Malley and Nathaniel Moses Veterans, who are more likely to live in rural areas, will be hurt especially hard by the double kneecapping of Medicaid and Veterans Affairs (VA). The New York Times reports that, in addition to layoffs, the VA has been rocked by DOGE’s abrupt return-to-work policy. VA psychiatrists who have, for decades, counseled veterans remotely, now suddenly have to conduct their sessions in open cubicles that lack privacy. Many of them are quitting in protest. Fourteen million (nearly one in five) rural adults rely on Medicaid, a program Republicans aim to cut by $880 billion (roughly 20 percent of the program) over the next decade. Already struggling rural hospitals and clinics rely on Medicaid funds to stay afloat. Over the past 10 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, leaving their patients stranded a hundred or more miles from the nearest emergency room. Most of the rural hospitals that do remain open have eliminated their maternity wards. Slashing Medicaid spending will trigger further hospital closures and strain already paltry substance abuse, mental health, and Indian health services. And then there are the millions of consumers just struggling to make ends meet. They’ve been hit not only by continued rising prices—the inflation rate has been between 2.4 and 3 percent since Trump took office—but by the elimination of protections from junk fees from banks and credit card companies. Joined by the Republican-controlled Senate, the Trump administration is eliminating the $8 late-fee cap instituted toward the end of Biden’s term, allowing companies to once again charge exorbitant fees to people who don’t pay on time. The lower average incomes of rural and working-class people make high prices and junk banking fees all the more difficult to manage. Donald Trump carried rural America by a 40-point margin. He promised forgotten Americans he would unrig the system, address the opioid epidemic, and restore small towns to health and prosperity. Even more than most of his predecessors, Trump has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. Reversing the tidal wave of destruction he has unleashed requires that we on the left do something we should have done a long time ago: open our doors wide to the farmers, miners, truckers, house cleaners, automakers, and working folks—white, brown, and Black—who picked him over us. We don’t just need them to regain Congress in 2026. We need them to save our country. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Elon Musk made big promises for Tesla, but 2 products are key to a rebound

Elon Musk made some big, exciting promises to Tesla investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call Tuesday — but he said they won't start paying off until mid-2026 or later. In the hours after Tesla reported, analysts said they were waiting for two things: a highly anticipated cheaper car and for Tesla's robotaxi to hit the market. Tesla's robotaxi, which was unveiled in October, is a fully autonomous vehicle that could be hailed on a ride-sharing app like a cab. Tesla has also been teasing a cheaper car — without disclosing its model or features — since 2020. Tesla missed expectations for the first quarter, reporting a 71% drop in profits and a 9% drop in revenue. Vehicle sales in particular suffered, with auto revenues down 20% year over year and vehicle deliveries down 13%. The EV maker has faced protests, boycotts, and attacks in recent months over Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Musk announced on the earnings call that he'd be stepping back from DOGE in May, good news to investors who had been concerned that Tesla wasn't getting enough of the billionaire's attention. Tesla stock jumped about 7% after hours, but it is down 41% this year. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts led by Andres Sheppard highlighted the robotaxi and cheaper model in a note following earnings. They added that regulatory approval for full self-driving and robotaxi remains a key risk for Tesla's stock price. A more affordable model could open up Tesla's potential customer base and help the company compete internationally against low-cost Chinese EVs. Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, said, "Tesla has room for significant improvement." "If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly-awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year," he said in a note following the earnings call. Yun Mei, an EV analyst at China Great Wall Securities, emphasized the robotaxi business in an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. She said that she has "strong faith" in Tesla's ability to launch robotaxis because Musk's ownership of xAI gives Tesla a "first mover advantage" in the physical AI space. But she estimated that robotaxis would take around three years to pay off. Tesla has declined offers to pair up with existing ride-hailing platforms like Uber to market its Cybercab business, which could delay its robotaxis becoming mainstream. In a note published on the day the Cybercab was unveiled in October, Jefferies analysts wrote that Tesla may struggle without a partner like Uber or Lyft. Tesla's biggest cheerleader said that these product launches require Musk's focus, which has recently been on DOGE. "This quarter was a disaster," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Tuesday appearance on CNBC after Tesla's earnings. "Everything that's going on here in terms of the opportunities around autonomous, lower cost vehicles, Cybercab, everything else — Musk needs to drive that," he added. Ives was more positive about Musk's decision to spend less time on DOGE. In a research note published after Tesla's analysts call, he hailed the move as a "turning point" for the company. "Musk recommitting as CEO at Tesla and basically leaving his DOGE role over the next month is the biggest and best possible news Tesla investors could have heard last night," Ives wrote, adding that Tesla had got its "biggest asset" back ahead of the crucial robotaxi and affordable EV launches. Musk also set some lofty goals for Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Tesla is trying to diversify as EV sales have struggled. Slowing EV sales were an issue for Tesla even before Musk's work with DOGE, in part because of increased competition and consumers opting for hybrids over fully electric vehicles. Musk said he expects Tesla to have millions of fully autonomous Teslas on America's streets by the second half of next year. Musk added that Tesla would "start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year" or the second half of next year. The company has often missed target dates in the past, and Musk has previously acknowledged being overly optimistic about timelines. Musk also said Tesla was making good progress on Optimus, its humanoid robot, and it expected to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year. He said the company could be producing one million robots a year by 2029 or 2030. Jump to
