Update font size. Reset Apple is enlisting a seasoned professional to tackle its AI challenges. Kim Vorrath, who has spent 36 years with the company, is moving to the AI and machine learning division. Her new role will concentrate on enhancing Siri and other AI initiatives under the supervision of AI head John Giannandrea. Vorrath has been instrumental in the development of several of Apple’s major products, from managing the initial iPhone software to supervising the operating systems for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Her most recent project involved software development for the Vision Pro spatial computing headset. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ The move helps bolster a team that’s racing to make Apple a leader in AI — an area where it’s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout. The Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple’s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple’s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset… The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified… It has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: At this point, sigh, we’ll just wish good luck to Vorrath and review: Apple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit. Where’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.” AAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposed in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024 Note: Apple’s (virtual, of course) 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for February 25, 2025 at 8:00 am P.T. Apple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct… Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards. Apple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.]. This is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs who even started the company’s work on Apple Silicon, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but, thanks to Jobs and Cook’s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs’ tenure, including the retail store buildout which is responsible for a significant portion of Apple’s growth, the company now has more than enough money to make up for Cook’s lack of vision. – MacDailyNews, April 23, 2024 The new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024 When you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024 MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024: ‎ Executing a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. Sigh. You can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 Larger displays on iPhone 16 Pro models, and hundreds of millions of iPhones that are 4+ years old, will do the heavy lifting for iPhone sales and iPhone’s average selling price (ASP). Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple’s history has shown – cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough – that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI – which they clearly did – and then use its huge war chest to catch up – which they’re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) – and, hopefully, [someday] surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. – MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024 Apple needed new blood years ago, but the old blood simply won’t let go. – MacDailyNews, January 22, 2025 We are currently about 1/4th of the way to being sustainable with Substack subscriptions.

It’s obvious, Tim Cook prioritizes shareholder delight over customer delight and as long as he’s delivering on shareholder value, shareholders won’t question anything. They only care about milking Apple for what it’s worth. The Board is no different. And this is sad, actually. Apple Intelligence and Siri are utterly useless.. .Damn shame how pathetic it is.. At least 50% of the time I can’t even get “stupid ass” (SIRI) to call someone… It just glows.. Cook needs to go.. Sometimes I wonder if Rim Cock and the other Apple execs even use Siri. Do they have any idea? Can’t believe the comments here…lots of ingrates. I can only imagine…none of you know how good the emojis are? They make me a fulfilled human being. Thank you Tim.

Title: Federal Reserve, BlackRock retreat from climate coalitions as economic realities take precedence

EditorEconomy Natural News, Willow Tohi In a striking shift, major financial institutions and corporations are stepping back from ambitious climate commitments, signaling a growing recognition of the economic costs and impracticalities of such policies. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) highlight a broader retreat from climate-focused agendas that critics argue have overreached and underdelivered. The Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bank’s purview. “Climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,” Powell stated, reflecting the Fed’s reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fed’s exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRock’s departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europe’s energy crisis. The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UK’s climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—far exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. The unraveling of climate coalitions presents an opportunity to reassess priorities. Policymakers must focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability and innovation rather than pursuing utopian ideals. The retreat from costly and ineffective climate policies underscores the need for a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges. As institutions like the Federal Reserve and BlackRock step back, the broader public is beginning to question the wisdom of sweeping climate mandates. This shift marks a turning point, one that could pave the way for policies grounded in reality rather than ideology.

Title: Amazon Under Fire: Minister Tries to Talk Tough on Quebec Exit

Amazon’s decision to shut down seven distribution centres in Quebec, affecting over 1,900 jobs, has sparked sharp criticism from Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne. In a strongly worded letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Champagne expressed disappointment over the closures and urged the company to reconsider, shared the minister on Thursday evening on X. “When Amazon entered the Canadian market, it did so recognizing the value of Canada’s exceptional workers,” Champagne wrote. He pointed out the closures undermine Amazon’s commitment to being “Earth’s best employer” and called the decision inconsistent with the company’s values. The closures come after Amazon’s Laval distribution centre became the first in North America to unionize, raising speculation that decision could be linked to its resistance to unionized labour. Champagne argued that Amazon’s Quebec facilities play a vital role in the company’s supply chain, ensuring quick delivery across the province and contributing significantly to the local economy. He added that the layoffs would have ripple effects on communities, highlighting the importance of Amazon’s business partnership with Canada. “It is not too late to reconsider your decision,” Champagne urged, adding that such layoffs raise concerns about Amazon’s long-term commitment to the Canadian market. The letter called for a review of Amazon’s relationship with the Canadian government and extended an invitation to discuss the matter further. With Parliament currently prorogued by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and a spring federal election looming, Champagne’s words don’t mean much. But at least it makes his constituents feel better. In an emailed statement to iPhone in Canada on Wednesday, Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said, “Following a recent review of our Quebec operations, we’ve seen that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to what we had until 2020, will allow us to provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run.” She added, “This decision wasn’t made lightly, and we’re offering impacted employees a package that includes up to 14 weeks’ pay after facilities close and transitional benefits, like job placement resources.” In a nutshell, Laval workers unionized and Amazon appealed to the labour board, citing the vote didn’t recognize worker rights, since the vote was not by secret ballot, but rather by signing cards. Amazon lost the appeal–and now they have pulled out of Quebec.

Title: Trump’s $500B Stargate A.I. Project: What Will It Build and Does It Actually Have the Money?

On Tuesday (Jan. 21), President Donald Trump announced an A.I. initiative called Stargate. During a press conference at the White House attended by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBF) CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the returning President told reporters the initiative will invest $500 billion—equivalent to almost 2 percent of the annual U.S. economic output—over the next four years to bolster A.I. infrastructure in the U.S. and help the nation gain an edge over China. Trump estimates the Stargate will create 100,000 jobs. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. OpenAI will lead the project alongside Oracle, SoftBank and the UAE government’s tech investment Arm, MGX. Other key players in the tech alliance include Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Arm. Seemingly a nod to Roland Emmerich’s 1994 sci-fi film “Stargate,” which explores the concept of intergalactic portals—Stargate will develop “physical and virtual infrastructure” to power advanced A.I. systems, according to the President. The project is launching with an immediate $100 billion funding commitment to address critical challenges in A.I. infrastructure, such as the need for cutting-edge data centers across the U.S. and the electricity to power them. The partnership capitalizes on OpenAI’s established ties with Nvidia, which began in 2016, and a newer collaboration with Oracle, leveraging the company’s expertise in data centers and enterprise analytics. SoftBank’s financial resources further bolster the project, but details remain scarce. Nvidia and Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment by Observer. Stargate’s first data center, which will span one million square feet, is already under construction in Abilene, Texas, Ellison said at this week’s press conference, adding that “more will be built” across other U.S. locations. Tech leaders not involved in the project are skeptical about its viability, especially given its massive size. Elon Musk, who has been vocal in his criticism of OpenAI, challenged the viability of the project’s funding. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.” Altman responded to Musk’s doubt by offering to show him the ongoing construction of the data centers. “Want to come visit the first site already under way?,” Altman wrote in a retort on X. “I realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you’ll mostly put America first.” Musk also questioned Altman’s newfound support for Trump, citing his anti-Trump tweets during the 2016 Presidential election. He shared a screenshots of Altman’s 2021 post where the OpenAI CEO expressed gratitude to LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman for funding legal efforts to preventing Trump’s re-election in 2020. In a post yesterday, Altman said watching the President more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him. I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!” Big tech companies are racing to build their own data centers. Amazon’s AWS recently pledged $11 billion to expand data centers in Georgia; Meta announced a $10 billion A.I. hub in Louisiana; and Musk’s xAI recently built a data center in Memphis. At the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed Musk’s remarks on Stargate, reaffirming the company’s $80 billion commitment to expanding A.I. infrastructure globally. “All I know is, I’m good for my $80 billion,” Nadella said. “And all this money is not about hyping A.I., but is about building useful things for the real world!” He commented under Musk’s post on X. Despite the tensions, experts see the project as a necessary step to secure the U.S.’s leadership in the global A.I. race. “Stargate Project is the foundation we need to power the next generation of A.I. agents,” Claudionor Coelho, chief A.I. officer of the cloud security company Zscaler, told Observer. Matt Zeiler, founder and CEO of the deep learning and A.I. lifecycle platform Clarifai, said for Stargate to be truly successful, it must make a mark across multiple domains. He pointed to the rapid progress of foundational A.I. models in fields ranging from protein folding to patient communication. “In areas where A.I. architectures like transformers are already proving effective or where data can be easily tokenized, Stargate has the potential to be a game changer,” he told Observer.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched a two-week winning streak despite closing lower Friday after giving up gains following a fresh intraday record high as investors digested more corporate earnings and economic data. At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the S&P 500 index fell 0.3% but had earlier hit a fresh record high of 6,128.18. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 140 points, or 0.3%, while All three major averages are on track to post their second positive week, with the S&P 500 posting a record high, after President Donald Trump said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately” as he addressed world leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) stock rose nearly 1% after the telecom major reported its best quarterly wireless subscriber growth in five years. American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock fell 1.4% despite the financial giant reporting a 12% jump in fourth-quarter profit, as more consumers swiped cards during the holiday season for travel and online shopping. Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 1.4% after the aircraft manufacturer said it will post a bigger-than-anticipated loss of around $4 billion in its most recent quarter, as it grappled with a prolonged strike, charges related to US government projects and expenses linked to a slew of job cuts. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock dropped 7.5% after the analog chipmaker forecast first-quarter profit below estimates, as it grapples with an inventory buildup in its key automotive and industrial markets. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock soared 20% after the cloud communications software maker announced that it expects adjusted earnings to come in at the top range of guidance for the fourth quarter and unveiled positive guidance for the next couple of years through 2027. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) hit a record intraday high on Friday after unveiling spending plans to invest about $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditure this year as it builds out its AI infrastructure. Intuitive Machines Inc (NASDAQ:LUNR), meanwhile, won a $2.5M contract from Nasa to advance lunar logistics handling and offloading, and surface cargo as well as mobility solutions. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, fell to 71.1 in January, down from 74.0 a month earlier, marking the decline in six months. The data comes ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, and the future path of interest rates. The US central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with Fed officials expected to largely disregard any inflationary effects stemming from tariffs under Donald Trump's administration, as such impacts are viewed as one-time price level increases rather than persistent inflationary pressures, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note. Earlier Friday, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates by 25 basis points, marking the third hike by the central bank since it began scaling back its ultra-loose monetary policy in early-2024.

Title: Washington Post editor says newspaper ‘utterly lost its soul’ after ‘equating’ Biden, Trump pardons
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/media/washington-post-editor-david-maraniss-says-newspaper-utterly-lost-its-soul/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:43:14Z
Full Content:
A longtime associate editor at the Washington Post criticized his own newspaper for an editorial that blasted both President Trump and his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for having “both abused their pardon powers” and “setting dangerous precedents.” David Maraniss, who has spent nearly five decades at the Washington Post, took to social media on Wednesday and bemoaned the fact that his employer “has utterly lost its soul.” “The Washington Post editorial this morning essentially equating Biden’s questionable pardons with Trump’s outrageous Jan. 6 pardons was unconscionable,” Maraniss wrote on the Bluesky microblogging platform on Wednesday. “The newspaper I’ve been part of for 48 years has utterly lost its soul.” Maraniss, who has written biographies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, referred to an editorial titled: “Pardons from Biden and Trump flout the rule of law.” “President Joe Biden started the trouble by issuing preemptive pardons for five family members as well as former members of his administration,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote. “His rash action opens the door for future presidents to likewise immunize their families and staffs from merely theoretical prosecution by their successors — as though future presidents should be considered enemies whose actions must be defended against.” In the next paragraph, the editorial calls out Trump for pardoning those convicted for their roles in the rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “His reckless handout risks emboldening militias and others to commit future acts of barbarity in support of political aims. When such violence is tolerated, it happens more often,” the editorial read. The New York Post has sought comment from the Washington Post. Maraniss on Thursday told Status newsletter that it “disheartens” him “to see what is happening in this era of leadership” — a reference to owner Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the Amazon founder, has so far ignored a request from more than 400 of the newspaper’s staffers to visit the newsroom in the wake of an exodus of talent sparked by the decision to spike an endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris. A large chunk of the newspaper’s left-leaning readership was so outraged by the move that a reported 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships. “People are in utter despair,” a Washington Post staffer told Status. The newsletter said Washington Post employees found it “confounding … as to why Bezos insists on maintaining ownership of the newspaper.” “While he once seemed to take pride in owning it, and perhaps even enjoyed that the outlet served as a bulwark against Trump in his first term, that no longer seems to be the case,” Oliver Darcy wrote in Status. The Post has sought comment from Bezos. In recent weeks, the Washington Post has parted ways with several high-profile reporters and editors who have decamped for other media outlets. Philip Rucker, the highly regarded national editor, left for CNN, while longtime opinion columnist and Trump-basher Jennifer Rubin resigned to join Substack. Ann Telnaes, the newspaper’s cartoonist, resigned after the publication refused to print her cartoon mocking Bezos and other tech moguls as being too subservient to Trump. Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, two national political reporters, left for The Atlantic while investigative political reporter Josh Dawsey quit to join the Wall Street Journal. Morale at the Washington Post has been further damaged by recent layoffs of staffers on the business side. Management at the newspaper has also laid down the law and told staffers that they are welcome to submit their resignation if they refuse to return to the office five days per week. Advertisement

Title: 'Too much pessimism' — Fink, Trump and Schwarzman take aim at risk-averse Europe in Davos
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-fink-schwarzman-lagarde-wef-davos-europe-economy-regulation-culture-2025-1

The US economy is the toast of Davos, while Europe has been thrown to the wolves at the elite gathering in the Swiss Alps this week. World leaders, business titans, and policy gurus have hailed America's resilient growth, can-do culture, free-flowing capital, and bright prospects if President Trump succeeds in bolstering investment and cutting regulations. In contrast, they called out widespread pessimism, siloed markets, suffocating regulations, and an aversion to taking risks and shouting out successes in Europe. Here are some of the best comments from Davos about Europe: "They're very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved," Trump said about his European friends and acquaintances. "I love Europe, I love the countries of Europe, but the process is a very cumbersome one, and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose." "There's too much pessimism in Europe," Fink said, based on his conversations with Davos attendees. "I've never felt the pessimism being larger and more profound." "Europe is a myth," he said, calling out its fragmented capital and banking markets, and its lack of dynamism and entrepreneurship relative to countries like the US and China. "I don't see Europe moving forward enough; I see Europe still focusing on backward looking too much." Lagarde said corporate bosses are "not very upbeat" about Europe as they're worried about issues including energy prices and excessive red tape. Their concerns should be a "wake-up call that we Europeans, those in policymaking places, have to really take to heart and respond fast to," she said. "So if the European leaders can actually get their act together, respond to this wake up call and existential threat that can be identified, then I think that there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call." Georgieva described the IMF's economic forecast for Europe over the next couple of years as "sort of meh, not great." "United States has a culture of confidence; Europe has a culture of modesty," Georgieva said. She joked the highest praise she ever received from her parents was "not too bad" while in the US, "you just move your legs and you're fantastic, you blink and you're great." "So my advice to my fellow Europeans is more confidence, believe in yourself, and most importantly tell others that you do." Ulbrich, whose company works in real estate and investment management, told Business Insider at Davos that European officials seemed prouder to announce regulations on artificial intelligence than to reveal big investments in the tech. He said that "demonstrates very nicely the difference in culture: The Americans are looking first to the opportunity, and the Europeans tend to look first toward the risk." "A lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU," Schwarzman said, adding that they especially blame bureaucracy for slower growth rates in Europe. Kadri said that since she moved to Europe in 2019, there've been "19,000 pages of regulation published just for the chemical industry," and she's been "hiring more people in the legal and compliance departments than in my innovation department." The executive said that small and midsize businesses can't deal with the "soup of alphabet of reporting" requirements, and the bureaucratic burden is "destroying the fabric of the industry." Kadri called for a major simplification of the rules and removal of red tape to improve transparency and predictability, which she said would improve efficiency and drive investment. Jump to

Saturday, 25 Jan 2025 OTTAWA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is threatening to review its commercial relationship with Amazon after the online retail giant decided to close all its distribution centers in Quebec, local media reported Friday. Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne, expressing his strong disappointment, demanded that Amazon "immediately" reconsider the decision, according to the report. Amazon said that it would cease operations in the French-speaking province over the next two months, turning back to the third-party model it had until 2020 for package deliveries. As such, at least 1,700 regular employees in Quebec and 250 temporary-seasonal workers would lose their jobs, said the report. "This is not the way business is done in Canada," said Champagne on his social media account, stating that the "large and sudden layoffs are cause for concern." Amazon denied that the decision was made following the unionization of 200 employees last spring at one of the warehouses, according to the report. Thank you for your report!

Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: How the Fed’s latest decision could affect crypto markets in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:26:57Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin may have kicked off 2025 with a rebound back to $100,000, but since the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s December 2024 Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Jan. 8, the BTC/USD exchange rate dropped to as low as $91,220.84. Bitcoin has stabilized at around $95,000 since then, but concerns run high whether further news about the future direction of interest rates and monetary policy will result in an additional negative impact to the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have entered the financial mainstream, they have become increasingly sensitive to policy changes from the Federal Reserve. With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at the latest news from the Fed, and see what it could mean for the performance of both Bitcoins and altcoins in the months ahead. As revealed in the aforementioned Fed meeting minutes, the central bank once again cut interest rates by 0.25%, or 25 basis points. This was in line with expectations. However, while the latest rate cuts arrived as expected, other takeaways from the meeting minutes caught investors off-guard. Namely, the Fed’s signaling of its plans to reduce the number of 25-basis point rate cuts in 2025. Before the meeting minutes hit the street, the market was still expecting four such cuts throughout the year. The latest remarks from Fed officials regarding quantitative tightening also suggested that the “Fed pivot” this year will not be as rapid of a shift from hawkish to dovish as previously anticipated. Taking this into account, it’s not completely surprising that Bitcoin has once again encountered negative volatility. Nor is it surprising that more volatile altcoins, like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, have all experienced double-digit declines over the past week. As “risk-on” assets, cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, perform better during times of accommodative fiscal policy. Yet while the Fed may be not turning as dovish as previously expected, and is in fact continuing to engage in monetary tightening, the impact of these policy decisions on cryptocurrency prices in 2025 may not be as dire as it seems at first glance. Although the cryptocurrency market reacted negatively to the Fed’s current policy gameplan, said plans could still result in further upside for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For one, the planned implementation of fewer 25 basis-point rates still means a further loosening of monetary policy, helping to justify additional upside for this “risk-on” asset class. Second, with regards to Bitcoin, other positive factors are at play that could drive further upside for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. These include increased institutional and retail investor allocation, as well as the specter of a more favorable crypto regulatory environment from the incoming Trump administration. Binance CEO Richard Teng commented on what we can expect in the crypto industry in 2025, “We expect to see development across all aspects. Crypto regulation saw great growth across the world in 2024 and we expect to see more in 2025. Given the recent U.S. presidential election and expected crypto regulation from its new government, we expect to see other countries follow the lead from the U.S. and enact more legislation across the world.” Teng continues, “In terms of institutional interest, financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto business in 2024, and we expect to see more new players next year. More companies are learning about crypto and integrating crypto features like tokenization into their business. This is a trend that has grown for years and we expect to see more development in.” Admittedly, the recently-announced changes to the Fed’s rate cut plans could still negatively impact the performance of altcoins in the short-term. Altcoins are much more sensitive to changes in fiscal policy. Nevertheless, if a bull market continues in Bitcoin, chances are it will spill over into the altcoin space as well. Investors profiting from a continued run up in the price of Bitcoin could cycle their gains into Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and other major and emerging altcoins. Over a longer timeframe, the Fed’s decision to more cautiously lower interest rates and loosen fiscal policy may do little to threaten the long-term bull case for cryptocurrencies. Due to a variety of trends, including the proliferation of exchange-traded cryptocurrency investment products, institutional and retail capital inflows into cryptocurrencies are poised to continue. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, following the latest jobs report, there is growing doubt whether the Fed will further walk back its 2025 rate cut plans. Even if the Fed sticks to its current plan, this asset class is likely to stay highly volatile. Caution and patience remain key. Nevertheless, taking into account not just the Fed news,but the other positive trends at play as well, the opportunity for long-term price appreciation with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still on the table.

Title: Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) on Substack by Jacob Rowe. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ACHV. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV)'s share was trading at $3 as of Jan 23rd. Copyright: nedoba / 123RF Stock Photo Achieve Life Sciences (ACHV) presents a compelling investment opportunity, with its nicotine cessation drug, Cytisinicline, positioned to disrupt the market. The company has reached a significant milestone in its development, completing a six-month safety study involving 300 patients without any safety concerns, paving the way for an NDA submission in April/May. As Cytisinicline holds breakthrough designation, the likelihood of a priority review is high, particularly given its superior efficacy and safety profile compared to Chantix, the previous category leader now available as a generic. This positions Achieve for substantial upside potential, especially as the stock currently trades near 52-week lows despite being de-risked. Cytisinicline’s data from multiple Phase 3 trials underscores its efficacy, with odds ratios significantly outperforming Chantix. For example, while Chantix achieved an odds ratio of 2.88 over a 12-week trial, Cytisinicline demonstrated odds ratios between 5.0 and 6.3 in comparable trials, alongside fewer side effects. Its safety profile closely mirrors typical nicotine withdrawal symptoms, further solidifying its appeal. With an expected price point of $700–$800, Cytisinicline could capture a significant share of the $1 billion-plus nicotine cessation market. Even a conservative 30% market share implies $300 million in annual revenue, supporting a valuation of approximately $1 billion at 3x sales. A 60% share would push revenue to $600 million and valuation to $1.8 billion, representing a potential 5x–10x return for investors based on the current diluted share count. The timeline for additional catalysts is clear. Results from the ongoing one-year safety study, which involves 100 patients continuing from the initial cohort, are expected by mid-year, further de-risking the investment. Achieve’s strategic positioning, bolstered by its new investment banking board members and a cash runway through Q3 2025, increases the probability of a buyout in 2025. Moreover, priority review could lead to a PDUFA date in Q4 2024, potentially driving a sharp valuation rerating as biopharma funds recognize the mismatch between market price and intrinsic value. With its transformative potential and favorable risk/reward profile, Achieve Life Sciences stands as a strong candidate for multi-bagger returns. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 6 hedge fund portfolios held ACHV at the end of the third quarter which was 7 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ACHV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACHV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s Need to Know: Davos newsletter. To get updates on the World Economic Forum delivered straight to your inbox, sign up here. After a week dominated by President Donald Trump’s shadow and tariff tensions, Davos 2025 wrapped up with a subdued final day, giving the world’s elite a chance to catch their breath and focus on the broader picture. One of the final panels brought together the world’s top economic voices for a reality check. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pushed back against European pessimism, saying that “the economy is larger than any one political party.” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pointed to Europe’s “huge potential” in GDP, talent, and savings, urging leaders to “respond to this wake-up call and existential threat.” Both Lagarde and IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva emphasized AI’s crucial role in growth. “Make sure that artificial intelligence is not a privilege of few,” Georgieva urged. Lagarde said that AI’s potential is “huge,” but that it must “improve the state of the world, for all of us.” Georgieva also zeroed in on productivity as the key differentiator between U.S., European, and emerging market growth. Her prescription for lagging regions? “Capital has to have long legs and go where it makes the biggest difference,” she said, with a particular call for Europe to deepen its capital markets. All of these themes echoed through the week at the World Economic Forum: Europe’s challenges and potential, AI’s promise and perils, and the ever-present question of American influence. The gathering’s official theme, “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,” took on new meaning with each passing day. Monday opened with European leaders defending democracy and climate action against Trump’s America First agenda. By midweek, his virtual appearance laid out a second-term vision from tariffs to his $500 billion “Stargate” AI project, while Meta’s moderation retreat and Spain’s call for digital ID requirements highlighted the growing rift over tech governance. NATO chief Mark Rutte surprised many by embracing Trump’s Russia stance, while WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala urged everyone to “chill” about tariffs. Even JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund chief agreed on one thing: Trump’s return was awakening Wall Street’s “animal spirits.” Through it all, one message remained clear: Whether it’s AI access, trade policy, or capital markets, the push-and-pull between cooperation and competition will define 2025 — Trump’s version of it, anyway.

Title: Trump's Stargate AI project backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank is taking shape: Here's what we know

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. One of the Trump White House's first big announcements aligned itself with the artificial intelligence boom. In a splashy announcement on his second day in office, President Trump told Americans that a new $500 billion project — backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and OpenAI — would generate “ over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.” The project created a company called Stargate, which said in Tuesday's announcement it would “begin deploying $100 billion immediately" starting with data centers in Texas and spend an additional $400 billion over the next four years. Trump called the project, "a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential under a new president." Microsoft (MSFT), AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and British chip designer Arm (ARM) were named as “key initial technology partners” by Stargate. The stocks of all companies involved soared, with Oracle and Nvidia rising 7% and 4%, respectively, the day after the announcement. But these early announcements have been followed by social media feuds featuring Elon Musk, questions about funding, and rival announcements about AI investments slated for this year. Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, took aim at Stargate’s backers on his social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Responding to a post from OpenAI about the project, he wrote, "They don’t actually have the money," adding, "SoftBank has well under $10B secured." Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, wrote back, “Wrong, as you surely know.” OpenAI has raised nearly $17 billion in the past two years and opened up a $4 billion credit line with various banks, though the company said it expected to lose $5 billion in 2024 while generating only $3.7 billion in revenue. OpenAI would need to raise an additional $19 billion to fund Stargate, according to The Information. A person familiar with Stargate refuted Musk's claims, telling Yahoo Finance that the project is indeed prepared to immediately deploy the initial $100 billion investment, noting that SoftBank had $24 billion in cash as of its most recent quarterly earnings. The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that Stargate has not yet secured its required funding, will receive no government financing, and will only serve OpenAI once completed. So far, only about 4% of Americans report using AI daily in their workplaces, though almost all Americans use AI-enabled products in their daily lives, often without realizing it. Then there’s the question of whether the project will hold true to Trump’s jobs promise, as data centers typically employ fewer than 100 people. Apple’s (AAPL) $1.3 billion data center project in Iowa, for example, committed to employing just 50 people in permanent positions, according to a Forbes investigation. All the while, critics say nondisclosure agreements between data centers and local officials mean residents are often left in the dark about the colossal buildings in their backyards driving up their utility bills. And some lawmakers argue that tax breaks for data centers aren’t worth the cost. Bloomberg reported this week that the first data center associated with Stargate in Abilene, Texas, will employ just 57 people at an average wage of $57,600 per year. On the heels of the Stargate announcement, Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post Friday that Meta (META) will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025, far higher than the estimated spending of $38 billion to $40 billion in 2024 it disclosed to investors back in October. Wall Street analysts had expected Meta's capital expenditures to tally closer to $51 billion this year, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Much of Meta's spending would go into building a 2-gigawatt data center “that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” Zuckerberg said. Two gigawatts is enough energy to power 700 electric vehicles for a full year. To be sure, proponents argue that the data centers have ripple effects on local economies. “Each direct job in the U.S. data center industry helps to create 7.4 ancillary jobs on average throughout the U.S. economy,” commercial real estate firm CBRE wrote in a report last year.

Title: This week's meme coin mania sparked a wave of unauthorized tokens looking to cash in on the frenzy
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/trump-crypto-meme-coin-rally-melania-barron-ivanka-sorkin-bitcoin-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T16:41:16Z
Full Content:
Trump's meme coin was the talk of the crypto market this week, and its success sparked a wave of unofficial tokens looking to woo investors with the promise of swift gains. The frenzy began shortly after Donald and Melania Trump launched their own meme tokens, $Trump and $Melania, the weekend before the inauguration. Those coins attracted a rush of retail money — much of it from first-time crypto buyers — as well as some big money "whales." As their prices went parabolic, it didn't take long for imitators to crop up, with issuers minting new tokens bearing the names of high-profile figures. A meme coin named after Ivanka Trump quickly climbed 275%, according to CoinMarketCap data, with the coin spiking the morning of the presidential inauguration. However, unlike the official Trump and Melania tokens, $Ivanka is not affiliated with anyone in the Trump family. Ivanka Trump took to social media on Thursday to warn her followers about the crypto coin, adding that her legal team would be pursuing measures to "stop the continued misuse" of her name. "It has come to my attention that a fake crypto coin called 'Ivanka Trump' or '$IVANKA' is being promoted without my consent or approval," the first daughter wrote on X. "To be clear: I have no involvement with this coin. This fake coin risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money." The coin has plummeted 45% in the last 24 hours. Then there was a coin that invoked the name of Barron Trump, the president's youngest son. The price of $Barron coin soared rapidly amid a cocktail of social media hype and misinformation, garnering a market value of more than $450 million. However, when it became clear that the token had no official connection to anyone in the Trump camp, the price plunged as much as 95%. CNBC anchor and DealBook editor Andrew Ross Sorkin was another target of meme coin madness. "Sorkincoin" hit the market shortly after the journalist's talk with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which they joked that someone should create a coin inspired by Sorkin. Sure enough, a token bearing his name was minted soon after. Sorkincoin topped $170 million in trading volume in 24 hours, CoinMarketCap data shows, and Sorkin only found out about the crypto when a friend texted him about it, he told "Squawk Box" on Friday. "I was going to say, strangely flattering, but completely unauthorized. We don't know who created it. It's just a very strange thing to watch this thing go," he added. The week's meme coin mania caps off a heady few months for the crypto space since President Trump won the election last November. Trump, who was branded the "crypto president" while on the campaign trail, unleashed a burst of optimism for cryptocurrencies in hopes that the new administration would loosen regulation of the space and even get the government involved in bitcoin by establishing a national reserve. A long-awaited executive order on Thursday was light on specifics, however. Notably, while it addressed the potential creation of a national crypto stockpile, it didn't indicate that the government would necessarily be buying digital assets. Instead, it said a group would examine the potential for a reserve "derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." Elsewhere, the order was mainly related to the promotion of technology and clear regulations meant to support the space. Some on Wall Street have voiced skepticism over the exuberance that has gripped crypto recently. David Einhorn, the founder of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, noted that the market has entered the "fartcoin" stage of the cycle, wherein meme coins proliferate. "Nothing stops the launch of many more tradable coins," Einhorn wrote in his quarterly letter to investors. "It's anyone's guess as to what will happen next, but it feels like it's going to be wild."

Title: Stripe ruffles feathers as accidental ‘cartoon duck’ sent to laid-off staffers

An image accidentally sent to laid-off Stripe staffers shows their communications team might have just been winging it. The payment processing platform accidentally sent an image of a cartoon duck in emails to employees notifying them of their termination, The Post has learned. On Monday, Stripe – whose customers include Amazon, Alaska Airlines, Blockchain.com and Slack – announced it was laying off 300 employees, or approximately 3.5% of its workforce. The impacted staffers are mostly in product, engineering and operations roles, according to a leaked memo. These workers received emails with an attached image labeled “US-Non-California Duck” showing a fluffy yellow cartoon bird. Employees took to Blind, an anonymous site where corporate employees can share grievances, to make light of the duck-up. “Never liked it when someone put a duck on my Jeep…this would have sent me over the edge,” one Blind user registered as a Stripe employee wrote. A Stripe spokesperson confirmed that the duck images were accidentally sent to laid-off staffers, and that impacted employees received notices with the incorrect termination dates, as well. Business Insider earlier reported news of the leaked emails. “I apologize for the error and any confusion it caused,” Rob McIntosh, Stripe’s chief people officer, said in an email to employees. “Corrected and full notifications have since been sent to all impacted Stripes.” In a separate email, McIntosh told Stripe staffers that the company is still hoping to grow its workforce by 17% to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The tech startup, which launched in 2011, has suffered layoffs in the past. Stripe is a privately-held company, so most of its financials are not disclosed, but it was likely hit hard in 2022, when it laid off more than 1,000 staffers. At the time, CEO Patrick Collison blamed the economy and fears of a recession in a public letter – an explanation that won praise for its frankness. Stripe also cut its valuation multiple times over the years, though it recently jumped back up to around $70 billion in November, according to Bloomberg. The valuation puts Stripe in the same ranks as wealthy startups like SpaceX and OpenAI, though it’s still below its 2021 peak of $95 billion. Stripe is the second-largest startup in the Bay Area, behind only OpenAI, according to SFGate. Advertisement

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) R.E. Wermus Reeve Wermus is a journalism intern for The Daily Signal. Jonathan Skrmetti is on a winning streak. Tennessee’s attorney general is hoping it continues all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Skrmetti announced Thursday his latest win, a $7.4 billion settlement with members of the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma for fueling the opioid epidemic. Tennessee was among the 15 states that accused the company of creating a crisis across America that led to opioid addictions and overdose deaths. A week earlier, Skrmetti won a consumer protection lawsuit against BlackRock, ensuring that Tennesseans’ retirement funds will no longer be used to support the environmental, social, and governance agenda. “Tennessee beats ESG!” Skrmetti wrote on X. “BlackRock’s stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose. Transparency and accountability guarantee consumers an informed choice.” Tennessee beats ESG!BlackRock's stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose. Transparency and accountability guarantee consumers an informed choice.… pic.twitter.com/x49nE5BFFO Those victories might eventually pale in comparison to a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, which will decide if states can protect minors from transgender medical procedures. As the Supreme Court deliberates the groundbreaking case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, the attorney general spoke to Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts on his weekly podcast “The Kevin Roberts Show.” The court is expected to rule on the case at the end of its term in June. Skrmetti and Roberts discussed a wide range of topics, from combating the ESG movement in Tennessee to his recent victory halting the Biden administration’s rewrite of Title IX. He detailed his concerns with the regulatory approach of the Biden administration, saying, “I think the apotheosis of that overreach has been the Title IX rule.” Title IX was enacted in 1972 to prohibit sex-based discrimination in schools and education programs that receive federal funding. Starting under the Obama administration and continuing during President Joe Biden’s reign, Democrats have attempted to use Title IX to advance their gender ideology agenda. That came to a halt Jan. 9 when a federal court in Kentucky ruled that the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IX rule was unconstitutional. The Biden administration would have required educators to use pronouns inconsistent with a student’s sex and allowed students to use facilities that do not align with their sex. The case, called Tennessee v. Cardona, marked another major win for Skrmetti and Alliance Defending Freedom. Skrmetti, who sought to protect minors from LGBTQ+ ideology, called Biden’s effort a “totalitarian intrusion into every American school and university.” He explained how making major changes to American law through the current regulatory process bypasses key democratic principles. “You eliminate the need for consensus, you eliminate the transparency, you eliminate the public participation in the process, and ultimately, you alienate Americans from their government,” he warned. The attorney general hopes Tennessee v. Cardona and other regulatory cases brought by attorneys general will “force structural change in the approach of every executive branch.” When asked how America can continue to keep its system of law working, Skrmetti said, “When you look at the size and scope of the executive branch, Congress doesn’t have the muscle to exert real oversight.” He told Roberts that Congress does not have the necessary expertise to author “complicated legislation,” too often deferring instead to executive branch agencies. Watch the full episode of “The Kevin Roberts Show” to hear Skrmetti discuss the fight against government overreach, protecting minors from transgender ideology, and the ongoing U.S. v. Skrmetti case.

Title: Meta Will Spend Record $60 Billion On AI This Year, Zuckerberg Says—After Trump Announces Stargate Deal With OpenAI

Time Published: 2025-01-24T15:54:04Z

Meta will rapidly ramp up its spending in 2025 as part of its artificial intelligence push, according to its centibillionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday, as the battle between Meta and its generative AI competitors including OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI comes to the forefront this week with President Donald Trump’s announcement of the $500 billion “Stargate” joint venture with OpenAI. Mark Zuckerberg, center, at Trump's inauguration. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s Threads social media site, continuing with updates and predictions for Meta’s AI push in 2025. Perhaps Zuckerberg’s biggest revelation Friday was his guidance for $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures for Meta in 2025. That’s well above consensus analyst forecasts of $51 billion in capital expenditures this year, according to FactSet, and Zuckerberg’s median projected capex of $62.5 billion would be 63% above Meta’s $38.4 billion in projected 2024 capex and 129% above its $27.3 billion in 2023 capex. Meta will expand its “AI teams significantly” as part of its increased spending, declared Zuckerberg. The billionaire also predicted Meta’s Llama 4 large-language model “will become the leading state of the art” AI model and it will end 2025 with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the highly coveted Nvidia-designed processors powering generative AI programs including Meta AI, xAI’s Grok and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. After initially declining about 1% premarket following Zuckerberg’s announcement, shares of Meta rallied Friday, advancing as much as 1.6% shortly after market open before settling into a 0.9% gain by midmorning. Meta stock scored a record intraday share price of $646.90 and all-time high market value of more than $1.6 trillion. Meta shares are up more than 8% year-to-date. Zuckerberg’s 2025 outlook comes during a whirlwind week for generative AI after Trump capped his first full day in office announcing a $500 billion joint venture designed to build out the data center infrastructure to power OpenAI’s technology. Stargate was considered a win for OpenAI in its battle against the likes of xAI, Meta and Amazon-backed Anthropic to build out the best artificial general intelligence model, and the project highlighted a very public feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as Trump’s close ally Musk apparently undercut the president. Meta’s push beyond social media dates back to its 2021 name change from Facebook to Meta. Wall Street initially revolted at the company’s billions of dollars in advanced tech research, as Meta stock crashed 64% in 2022, before improving financial performance and a broader investor rush into all things AI bolstered the stock’s turnaround. Since Trump won a second term in November, Zuckerberg has overseen a major culture shift at his company, ending its fact checking and diversity, equity and exclusion (DEI) programs as Zuckerberg decried the company’s culture as losing its “masculine energy.” Meta remains an advertising company on paper, with 98% of revenue in its most recent quarter coming from social media ads. Zuckerberg is the fourth-richest person in the world with a $222 billion net worth, trailing only fellow American technology moguls in Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta, a stake worth about $200 billion. Meta will report financial results from 2024’s fourth quarter Wednesday afternoon. Consensus estimates call for $6.75 earnings per share and $47 billion in revenue, which would both be quarterly records. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta Will Spend Up to $65 Billion to Fuel AI Expansion, Mark Zuckerberg Says

The Facebook and Instagram boss reveals plans to build a data center that is nearly as big as Manhattan to fuel its AI growth Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said his company will spend $60-$65 billion this year as it looks to “significantly” expand its artificial intelligence team and services. The investment comes as Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is battling tech stalwarts like Google and Microsoft and upstart powerhouses like OpenAI for an upper hand in the budding AI industry. Most of Meta’s investment will go towards data centers — including one so big it would cover a large chunk of Manhattan — to fuel products like Llama, the AI model powering the company’s AI. He did not mention where that data center will be. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” He added that this “massive effort” will “bring online approximately 1 [gigawatt] of compute in ’25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million [graphic processing units].” The $60-$65 billion in capital expenditures is a major increase from 2024, when the company spent about $40 billion. Meta’s investors did not seem upset by the AI investment, at least initially, with the company’s stock price increasing 0.7% in early Friday morning trading. The company is worth $1.62 trillion. Friday’s announcement comes after Zuckerberg joined a number of other tech CEOs, including OpenAI chief Sam Altman and Tesla boss Elon Musk, at President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Zuckerberg, in his Facebook post, said AI will be a central facet of Meta’s business moving forward. “Over the coming years, [AI] will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation and extend American technology leadership,” he wrote, before adding “Let’s go build!” and a flexing arm emoji.

Title: This Extension Cord Finally Gives Non-Tesla EV Owners Safe, Hassle-Free Access To Superchargers
URL: https://jalopnik.com/this-extension-cord-finally-gives-non-tesla-ev-owners-s-1851746793
Time Published: 2025-01-24T14:45:00Z
Full Content:
Despite the latest nauseating news about Tesla CEO and Nazi salute enthusiast Elon Musk, Tesla’s Supercharger network is still the most comprehensive charging network in the country and the connector is now the North American Charging Standard (NACS). Superchargers are equipped with relatively short cords that work fine for Teslas, which all have charging ports on the rear left side, but they’re too short to reach the charge ports on some other EVs. Aftermarket charging adapters pose safety concerns due to thermal management and other issues, but EV charging equipment supplier A2Z plans to launch a new extension cable this summer that addresses both thermal management concerns and access concerns for non-Teslas. As the transition to industry-wide NACS adoption continues and more EVs of all makes gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network, this extension cord may become a necessity. Some EV owners are forced to take up two charging stalls for the Supercharger cord to reach their cars’ charge port, which can understandably ruffle feathers. A2Z’s extension cord is NACS to NACS, so you’ll still need another adapter for cars equipped with CCS ports, but it has four thermal sensors, two for each plug. It’s rated for 1,000 volts and 350 amps, and when electricity is flowing at high rates it can create a lot of heat, so the thermal sensors are capable of completely cutting off energy flow if the thermal threshold is surpassed. When it reaches production, the extension cord is estimated to be a length of five feet and weigh around seven pounds. The YouTube channel State of Charge tested out A2Z’s prototype extension cord which is much longer and heavier than the final product, but host Tom Moloughney had no issues to report. While Tesla’s latest V4 Superchargers have longer cables than the first three generations, it’s not likely that all the pre-existing Superchargers will be retrofitted with longer charging cables for a long time, so this new adapter may end up saving a lot of drivers a lot of headache in the interim. Motor1 reports, “Think of it as a giant elongated adapter,” A2Z engineer Robert Powell—who was formerly at Tesla—told Moloughney in an interview. “It keeps the communication going for not only the vehicle side temperature sensors but also the charger side temperature sensors.” The enclosures are also IP-67 rated, so snow or small puddles around the charger won’t be a problem, Powell said. He added that he has tested the 5-foot extension cable on several EVs, including the Chevy Equinox EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevy Bolt EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and more—it had no issues reaching the charging port on any of these models. The CEO of A2Z Amine Zitore said it will open a testing program for a handful of EV drivers next month, and that market launch is expected this summer. The current prototype cord is listed on the A2Z website for $284, though it’s currently out of stock, so we expect the final sale price to be around that mark. Preorders for the official A2Z Supercharger extension cable are supposed to open a month before the official launch of the final cord, but the company is currently in the process of obtaining safety certificates for the product, so that preorder date is still up in the air.

Title: Novo Nordisk stock surges 12% as an Ozempic alternative shows promising weight loss

Time Published: 2025-01-24T14:00:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock jumped 12% in pre-market trading Friday after it released promising results of an early-stage weight loss drug trial. The Danish pharmaceutical giant announced Friday that a small clinical trial found that 20 milligram once-weekly injections of its amycretin obesity drug helped obese and overweight patients lose 22% of their body weight in 36 weeks. “We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo. “The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.” Amycretin is what’s known as a “unimolecular long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist.” Essentially, it’s a combination of two hormones that regulate appetite and blood sugar levels. Popular GLP-1 agonists include Novo Nordisk’s own Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound and Mounjaro. Based on the latest results, Novo Nordisk said it’s now planning further clinical development of amycretin for obese and overweight adults. Findings from a small phase 1 clinical trial of oral amycretin last September suggested that the pill could lead to more and faster weight loss than popular weekly injection Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a larger clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s popular weight-loss drug Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It’s worth noting, however, that larger phase II, III, and IV trials, involving thousands more participants, could return different results. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

For the first time in seven years, Ripple (XRP) made an impressive rally to a new high price of $3.4. This surge has reignited bullish sentiment in the crypto community. Now, savvy investors believe more gains could occur as rumors of a broader crypto adoption are underway. Also, Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a top blockchain, showcasing steady growth over the past year. As more developments await this platform, traders expect that Solana will also hit new highs. Additionally, this new player, DTX Exchange (DTX), is gaining traction with its hybrid platform, as it aims to deliver unparalleled speed, security, and liquidity for traders. It leads many to speculate if DTX’s launch in Q1 2025 could position it ahead of Solana and XRP. The stage is indeed set for a thrilling showdown. This article shares more details about these assets. Ripple (XRP) Surges to $3.40 The XRP price’s rally to a recent high of $3.40 is fueled by a mix of exciting developments and bullish fundamentals. A game-changing report revealed Donald Trump’s openness to an America-first crypto reserve, spotlighting US-founded tokens like XRP, Solana, and USDC. This potential initiative has sparked investor optimism, setting the stage for increased adoption of these assets. Behind the scenes, crypto whales have been accumulating XRP, purchasing a staggering 1.43 billion tokens over two months — a move often signaling price discovery. This momentum has been bolstered by a 10% surge in trading volume, with $11 billion traded in just 24 hours. Adding fuel to the fire, the SEC’s appeal against Ripple unexpectedly boosted confidence, as the Commission didn’t dispute the court’s ruling that XRP isn’t a security. With bullish forecasts pointing to a breakout between $8 and $13, XRP’s rally may just be getting started. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Eyes on $300 as ETFs Spark Bullish Momentum Solana is making waves with a 20% intraday surge, currently trading above $230, despite a 30% dip earlier in January. Dominating the decentralized exchange (DEX) space with a 30% market share and $220+ billion in Q4 2024 trade volume, Solana remains a blockchain powerhouse. The buzz around SOL ETFs is also driving optimism, as top financial firms like Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise have filed applications with the SEC. With rulings expected between January 23 and 25, 2025, experts predict these ETFs could attract $3–6 billion in net assets within their first year. Technically, bullish patterns like strong support levels at $200 and $220 signal potential upside. While trading below the 50-day moving average, SOL shows bullish dominance, with green candles reinforcing upward momentum.

As the token price surges from $0.14 to its $0.20 launch price, new investors can still capitalize on a 40% gain before the presale ends. Analysts predict DTX could dominate 2025, riding the next bull run to unmatched heights.

A game-changing report revealed Donald Trump’s openness to an America-first crypto reserve, spotlighting US-founded tokens like XRP, Solana, and USDC. This potential initiative has sparked investor optimism, setting the stage for increased adoption of these assets. Behind the scenes, crypto whales have been accumulating XRP, purchasing a staggering 1.43 billion tokens over two months — a move often signaling price discovery. This momentum has been bolstered by a 10% surge in trading volume, with $11 billion traded in just 24 hours. Adding fuel to the fire, the SEC’s appeal against Ripple unexpectedly boosted confidence, as the Commission didn’t dispute the court’s ruling that XRP isn’t a security. With bullish forecasts pointing to a breakout between $8 and $13, XRP’s rally may just be getting started. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Eyes on $300 as ETFs Spark Bullish Momentum Solana is making waves with a 20% intraday surge, currently trading above $230, despite a 30% dip earlier in January. Dominating the decentralized exchange (DEX) space with a 30% market share and $220+ billion in Q4 2024 trade volume, Solana remains a blockchain powerhouse. The buzz around SOL ETFs is also driving optimism, as top financial firms like Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise have filed applications with the SEC. With rulings expected between January 23 and 25, 2025, experts predict these ETFs could attract $3–6 billion in net assets within their first year. Technically, bullish patterns like strong support levels at $200 and $220 signal potential upside. While trading below the 50-day moving average, SOL shows bullish dominance, with green candles reinforcing upward momentum.

Title: Trump has a message to CEOs: Build in America or pay up
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-message-ceos-davos-america-business-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T13:45:20Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump is making sure the whole world knows it: "America is back and open for business." Trump appeared via videolink to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where he addressed some of the world's most powerful leaders. BI's Spriha Srivastava was in the room to witness the audience go from laughter to silence in seconds. "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America," Trump said. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff," he added. Trump has previously threatened to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he said could begin as early as February 1. He also proposed a 60% tariff on China during his presidential campaign, but he said earlier this week he was considering a 10% tariff on goods from the country next month. When Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman asked about Europe, Trump didn't hold back, voicing his frustration with European regulatory enforcement actions against tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta (who were major donors to his inauguration and whose CEOs were prominent guests). "Whether you like them or not, they're American companies, and they shouldn't be doing that," Trump said. Trump has plans for the corporate tax rate. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO, asked how the Trump administration would prioritize GDP growth and reducing inflation amid his dozens of executive orders. Trump said he would work to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% from 21%, provided companies manufacture their products in the US. The president also called out big banks, accusing them of discriminating against conservatives. "Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America," he said. Bank of America responded publicly, saying it welcomes conservatives among its 70 million clients. The president also thanked Saudi Arabia after it announced it would invest $600 billion in the US, but Trump added that he would be asking the crown prince "who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion." When Trump finished, Schwarzman remarked: "I'm sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today." Trump's speech reminded Spriha of how different his style is from the measured, diplomatic tone that usually defines Davos. Whether his message landed the way he intended, however, is another question. BI's Katie Balevic, Dominick Reuter, Noah Sheidlower, and Allie Kelly have the full rundown of Trump's address.

There is significant demand for individuals interested in artificial intelligence and digital ... [+] transformation. There are widely mixed opinions on the state of the current job market. Most industry leaders signal that economic conditions seem to be healthy and the state of the market is incredibly robust. In fact, the latest report indicates that the U.S. economy added nearly 256,000 positions in December. However, many individuals are equally frustrated with the lack of opportunities and are experiencing a relatively stagnant labor market, especially with the numerous layoffs that have occurred in the last year. Some sectors have been more proactive than others, especially with regards to investing heavily in the new wave of AI innovation and digital transformation, which has resulted in increased demand for talent and skilled workers. Healthcare is one such field and has especially embraced AI as a means to reduce administrative burdens and improve workflows in the field. Indeed, 2025 will be a monumental year for this work. Individuals that are interested in healthcare technology and AI may have opportunities in the following 5 growth areas that are actively ramping up spending and hiring: 1. Work surrounding AI agents: 2025 is purported to be the year of AI agents in healthcare, which may be used for a variety of roles including responding to customer service inquiries, assisting with routine paperwork or even streamlining common and protocolized tasks. In fact, founder and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang mentioned at the CES conference earlier this month that IT departments will soon “become the HR of AI agents,” given how widespread and prevalent they will become. 2. Cloud engineering and architecture: many of the largest AI platforms including those by Google, Amazon and Microsoft are hosted and provided through their respective cloud services. For example, Google’s Vertex AI Search is a widely successful product which streamlines search within healthcare organizations and enables rapid insight generation for providers. Healthcare organizations can access this platform through Google Cloud. AWS and Microsoft Azure offer similar services. Thus, cloud applications have become incredibly critical in the AI arena and will undoubtedly require a lot of talent. 3. Digital twins technology: this is another growing area which enables organizations to create virtual models to run simulations and alter paradigms to better inform decision-making. Digital twin platforms can entail technical models such as a human heart model or a protein molecule to aid in drug development, or larger datasets across an entire population or community to inform macroscopic decisions. Digital twins have immense potential in healthcare as the technology can be used to resolve critical situations with high fidelity representations. Dr. Natalia Trayanova leads some of this work at Johns Hopkins University and uses the technology to support personalized healthcare in the field of cardiology: “digital twinning technology promises to deliver a digital representation of organs or even patients by using tools capable of simulating personal health conditions and predicting patient or disease trajectories on the basis of relationships learned both from data and from biophysics knowledge. Such virtual replicas would update themselves with data from monitoring devices and medical tests and assessments, reflecting dynamically the changes in our health conditions and the responses to treatment.” 4. Health devices: this area is projected to have a blockbuster decade as there has been an increased focus by the general population on collecting more health metrics and insights. For example, Google’s FitBit is one of the most popular devices in the world of personalized hardware and provides users with information on their daily energy expenditure and fitness goals. Another great example is the Oura ring, which has been incredibly popular in the last few years as a sleep tracking device; the company just recently hit $5 billion in valuation. There is a huge demand for both software experts and hardware engineers in this line of work. 5. Technology strategy: these roles will be a key aspect of healthcare organization portfolios in the coming years. Despite all the technical work, organizations must ultimately devise a strategy and justify their investments in artificial intelligence and digital health. This is where senior strategists and those familiar with enterprise optimization can come in handy, especially as many organizations are struggling to still define and realize the true ROI for healthcare AI applications. These leaders will be paramount to understand the technology landscape, develop accurate forecasts and determine the future course for organizations. Undoubtedly, those interested in technology will have to remain nimble and willing to up-skill themselves accordingly. Despite a rapidly changing job landscape, the swift growth of technology and AI, especially as they pertain to healthcare, offer numerous potential opportunities for determined job seekers to take advantage of.

Title: Signal: Surging Netflix Stock Could Hit Four Digits, And Soon

Netflix (NFLX) was a big winner on Wall Street this week. The streaming stock gapped 9.7% higher on Jan. 22, in the wake of an outstanding earnings report that saw the company post a top-line beat for the fourth quarter and topple 300 million subscribers. The shares hit a record high of $999 that day, before cooling off and settling at $953.99. The good news for investors betting on NFLX hitting four digits – the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. Netflix’s recent high coincides with historically low implied volatility (IV) – a combination that has generated tailwinds in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight times over the last five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) also happened to sit in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is the case with the stock’s current SVI of 25%, which sits in the 6th percentile of its annual range. Netflix stock chart with 80-day moving average Data shows that one month after those signals, the equity boasted a 75% win rate and averaged a 4.7% return over that timeframe. From its current perch of $979.92, a similar move would put NFLX comfortably above $1,000 in the next month. There are additional technical support levels to watch that could make this rally sustainable. Note in the chart above the channel of higher highs carved since August. If the stock can topple the upper rail of this channel, NFLX could be off to the races. The equity could also see chart support step up at its newly-cleared +10% year-to-date level, while its 80-day moving average was an effective springboard earlier this month, also per the chart above. Analysts have been slow to adjust, and bull notes could also keep the wind at the security’s back. There are still 16 brokerages of the 41 in coverage that are on the sidelines with “hold” or “strong sell” ratings, while NFLX’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,047.20 is only a 6.6% premium from its current perch.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire George Soros' Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stands against George Soros' long-term stock picks. George Soros is one of the most influential figures in finance, philanthropy, and global affairs. As the founder of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations, Soros has achieved monumental success as a hedge fund manager while using his wealth to champion democratic values, human rights, and social causes worldwide. Soros was born in Hungary during World War II, and his family survived Nazi occupation by securing false identities and hiding from persecution. In 1947, Soros fled Hungary and moved to England, where he studied at the London School of Economics. After graduating in 1952, Soros worked in various merchant banks before moving to the United States. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Soros began his career in finance in New York City, where he gained experience in arbitrage and securities trading. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management, which later became the Quantum Fund, one of the most successful hedge funds in history. Between 1970 and 2000, the Quantum Fund generated an average annual return of over 30%, making it one of the best-performing funds in history. In 1992, Soros became famous as the man who broke the Bank of England. He bet against the British pound, anticipating that it would be devalued due to economic pressures. His position netted him a profit of $1 billion in a single day, cementing his status as a legendary investor. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, his net worth is estimated at $7.2 billion. The 13F portfolio of his hedge fund is worth more than $6.9 billion. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Soros Fund Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Soros Fund Management's Stake: $5.5 million Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a midstream natural gas and crude oil pipeline company with headquarters in Houston, Texas. The following key aspects make this company a standout investment. Firstly, as per the report of the fourth quarter of 2024, the reported net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion, or $0.65 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This portrays that the company is effectively improving its earnings per unit, reflecting operational efficiency and potentially leading to increased returns for shareholders. Also, an 8% increase was observed compared to $1.3 billion, or $0.60 per unit on a fully diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2023, demonstrating positive financial health and the company’s ability to attract more capital. Secondly, the company declared a quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common unit, maintaining its commitment to returning value to unitholders. This unit repurchase program shows the company’s approach to capital management, which would further enhance unitholder value through these buybacks. Overall EPD ranks 13th on our list of George Soros' long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of EPD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EPD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What does OpenAI get from Stargate? A $500 billion chance to build a whole new moat.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-stargate-project-moat-deepseek-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T12:53:23Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has a new $500 billion project called Stargate. Consider it an extraordinary attempt by the ChatGPT maker to build itself a whole new moat in the face of growing competition from rivals at home and a buzzy startup in China. This week, OpenAI revealed plans to shift focus and spend $500 billion on AI infrastructure over the next four years. Stargate will focus on hardware powering advanced AI software, such as data centers and energy supply — all with Donald Trump's blessing. It is a colossal amount of money, but OpenAI has two critical reasons for spearheading the initiative alongside key partners SoftBank, Microsoft, and Oracle. First, reaching what OpenAI boss Sam Altman calls an era of "superintelligence" depends on having access to more computing power. The industry insists that AI models will get smarter when given more of it, making ownership and access a priority. Stargate, then, offers OpenAI a chance to build itself the kind of formidable "moat" that Warren Buffett once said companies need to ensure they maintain a competitive advantage against rivals. A vast infrastructure empire belonging to OpenAI would certainly help give it that. The second reason for betting big on infrastructure through Stargate is even more critical: OpenAI may have no choice but to build itself a new moat in response to a Chinese startup that this week caused a stir in Silicon Valley. When OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT to the world, it was clear that the combination of a powerful AI model and an intuitive, consumer-friendly interface gave it a moat that was the envy of Silicon Valley. How much of a moat ChatGPT offers OpenAI has come under increasing debate. The latest challenge to OpenAI's moat came on Monday as a little-known Chinese startup called DeepSeek stunned America's top AI researchers after revealing a new AI model called R1. In a paper, it said R1 rivals the frontier AI model OpenAI introduced just four months ago, o1. Like o1, it reasons, meaning it thinks carefully before responding. According to DeepSeek, which has obtained an MIT license to open-source its model, R1 achieves "performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks." That an open-source Chinese company has been able to release a free model competitive with the best OpenAI has to offer has not gone unnoticed among AI's most prolific leaders. Jonathan Ross, the CEO and founder of Groq, an Nvidia rival backed by BlackRock and Samsung, responded to a question in Davos this week about DeepSeek's latest release by claiming "open models will win." "We cannot do closed models anymore and be competitive — open always wins," the former Google engineer said while noting that it will be harder to differentiate between models soon. As he put it, "The models are not going to be particularly special for long." Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and AI researcher, told Business Insider that he has been adamant for a year now that "closed source players have almost no obvious moat" and that it is "certainly even more true now" following DeepSeek's release. It's not the first time OpenAI's moat has been challenged. In May 2023, when Google was busy playing catch up to ChatGPT, an internal memo written by an engineer inside the search giant, published by research firm SemiAnalysis, warned that "we have no moat, and neither does OpenAI." Why? Because, in the engineer's view, the gap in capabilities between the models being worked on in Silicon Valley versus the open-source community was "closing astonishingly quickly." We are, of course, almost two years on from the warning issued in that memo, and OpenAI has since then convinced investors that it is of market-leading value, having completed a $6.6 billion funding round at a $157 billion valuation in October. Nathan Benaich, founder and general partner of AI-focused venture capital firm Air Street Capital, offered Business Insider one explanation for why OpenAI has retained favor, noting ChatGPT has things like ease of use and reliability that make it a top pick for customers. "OpenAI, I think, has won the spot of being CocaCola for consumers," he said. "Who is the Pepsi? The gap is large." Avijit Ghosh, an applied policy researcher at Hugging Face, doubled down on the point, telling Business Insider that while DeepSeek's R1 performance "challenges conventional wisdom about technical moats in frontier AI," he thinks the reality is more nuanced. "The real differentiation isn't in raw model performance anymore — it's in how these capabilities are integrated into practical applications and systems, and tech behemoths are still leagues ahead in being able to vertically integrate and commodify their models into products," he said. OpenAI offered a demonstration of this on Thursday following the release of Operator — an AI agent that serves as an assistant capable of booking everything from dinner reservations to travel. This is clearly impressive, but resting competitive advantage on AI agents and an easy-to-use interface may still not be enough in the face of an entire industry making "agentic AI" its focus. The AI industry's pace of innovation is relentless. Stargate offers OpenAI a chance to build a new moat that could well be tougher to replicate than a large language model or AI agent for a few reasons. For one, having more computing power is vital to scaling models to greater levels of intelligence, experts say. Dylan Patel, founder of research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business Insider: "Stargate is extremely important for OpenAI to be competitive because the access to compute is what enables them to keep scaling." Groq's Ross, meanwhile, told a panel in Davos that he sees access to infrastructure being so important in the future that "what countries are going to be tussling over is how much compute they have access to." If OpenAI does manage to get Stargate built, it seems it will do so to serve its own purposes. A report from the Financial Times this week said Stargate will exclusively serve OpenAI — a sign that the project is meant to give the company an edge. OpenAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Business Insider. Clearly, then, the Stargate announcement suggests OpenAI sees a chance to build a new moat. It just can't be expected to come easy. Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman noted that while the project is likely to work as a VC play, where the outcome is expected to be delivered at an unknown date in the future after serious investment, "raising $500 billion is going to be a real challenge." OpenAI remains lossmaking, and its key Stargate partners, like SoftBank and Oracle, the main equity funders alongside the UAE's MGX, have cash on hand that falls far short of the $100 billion initially being deployed. From a sheer capital position, a new moat won't be cheap. Building the data centers and clean energy sources forming this new moat will require nationwide coordination spanning multiple initial technology partners, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, OpenAI, and Arm. Construction of a data center site in Texas is underway, but the project will need to go much further. Hugging Face's Ghosh also thinks the "'compute is everything' narrative misses the mark," as small teams like Deepseek have shown "remarkable results through clever engineering." Still, OpenAI seems ready to go all in on Stargate to build a new moat. Its future leadership in the industry may well depend on its success. Jump to

Investing.com -- Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has suggested that it might be time to reinvest in Europe, citing an overabundance of pessimism about the region. His comments were made during the World Economic Forum's annual meeting on Friday. The Euro zone has seen a modest return to growth at the start of the new year, according to a survey released on the same day. This growth is attributed to stable services activity in January and a reduction in the long-standing downturn in manufacturing. Fink voiced his views during a panel discussion on the global economic outlook in Davos. He stated that there was "too much pessimism on Europe." His belief is that it might be the right time to start investing again in Europe, although he also acknowledged that there was still progress to be made, particularly in areas such as the capital markets union.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been.

And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks.

Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: EssilorLuxottica stock target raised at Stifel on Meta partnership potential

Investing.com -- Stifel has raised its price target for EssilorLuxottica SA (EPA:ESLX) from €207 to €241, citing significant potential from its partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The collaboration, which began in 2019, has already yielded the Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, a product Stifel describes as a "game changer" in the nascent smartglasses market. The latest Ray-Ban Meta model, launched in September 2023, has been the only smart glasses to achieve mass-market success. Stifel highlights several reasons for the success of Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, including their integration of connected features into the iconic Ray-Ban frame, the minimal five-gram weight increase ensuring comfort for extended use, and a highly competitive $299 (€329) price point compared to standard Wayfarer glasses. Looking ahead, the investment bank expects smartglasses to contribute significantly to EssilorLuxottica’s future growth. Sales from the segment are projected to reach €3.7 billion by 2032, accounting for 9% of total revenue and adding 90 basis points to the company’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for sales during 2024-2032. Profitability, which is currently dilutive, is anticipated to turn accretive by 2029 as the business scales. According to Stifel, the Meta partnership positions EssilorLuxottica at the forefront of the smart glasses revolution. The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses feature improved technology, such as enhanced video recording and real-time AI capabilities. The investment bank draws a strong parallel between the emerging smart glasses market and the early days of smartwatches. “We estimate Ray-Ban Meta will have a 35% share of the smart glasses market by 2032 (versus c.70% today) with accretive profitability (vs. below average today),” Stifel analysts said. Stifel acknowledges several risks for EssilorLuxottica, including competitive threats from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which could accelerate market growth but also challenge EssilorLuxottica's dominance. Furthermore, privacy and regulatory concerns in regions like the EU, where Meta AI's functionalities are partially restricted, remain a hurdle. Despite the positive outlook, Stifel maintains its Hold rating on EssilorLuxottica, believing that much of the Meta partnership's potential is already reflected in the stock price. However, the prospect of Meta acquiring up to a 5% stake in the company could create volatility.

Title: Davos-BlackRock's Fink says probably time to be investing back in Europe

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) -There is too much pessimism around Europe and it could be time to be investing back in the region, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting on Friday. Euro zone business began the new year with a modest return to growth as stable services activity in January was complemented by an easing of the long-running downturn in manufacturing, a survey released earlier on Friday showed. "There's too much pessimism on Europe," Fink said during a panel debate on the global economic outlook in Davos. "I believe it's probably time to be investing back into Europe," he said, adding there was still progress to be made in areas such as capital markets union. On the same panel, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and ECB President Christine Lagarde agreed Europe needed to better mobilise capital to boost its economy. "We need to keep the talents at home, we need to keep the savings at home," said Lagarde, who characterised the global economic challenges facing Europe as Donald Trump's new presidency begins as representing "an existential threat". "If European leaders can get their act together and respond to this existential threat, there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call," she said. Speaking about the outlook for U.S. inflation, BlackRock's Fink said he was not too worried, adding that the U.S. Treasury yield curve reflected expectations for higher inflation and also fiscal deficits. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, trading at 4.64%, has risen from lows of around 3.60% in September. "I can see a scenario, I am not calling for it, where we see 5.5% on the 10-year (U.S.) yields," Fink said.

Title: DWS CEO Steps in as Private Credit Unit Struggles to Lure Cash

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- A few months into his role as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG’s asset management unit, Stefan Hoops presented shareholders his vision for growth with a “private debt muscle” as one key part of the strategy. Almost three years on, that plan is sputtering. Frankfurt-based DWS Group is struggling to attract sizable commitments from investors for a private credit fund targeting €1 billion ($1.05 billion), according to a person familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, some senior sales staff have been heading to the exit because the pay is higher at US rivals, several other people said. With his blueprint to tap the hot $1.6 trillion market for private credit failing to take off, Hoops, 44, now plans to dedicate more of his time to give the business a much-needed boost, another person said. One idea being considered is to more strongly leverage parent Deutsche Bank’s client relationships for direct lending, that person added. All the people who spoke with Bloomberg News asked not to be identified because the information they discussed is private. DWS is among newcomers struggling to make a mark in the increasingly crowded private credit space, where even BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, has turned to acquisitions to rapidly scale up in a global market that Moody’s anticipates will grow to $3 trillion by 2028. But for some traditional active fund managers, the allure of high returns and management fees is turning into a mirage in the absence of such deals. Last year, Fidelity International halted its European direct lending activities and trimmed its private markets team. On the other hand, US alternatives giant Ares Management Corp. announced this month that it raised €30 billion for its latest European direct lending fund, the largest of its kind in the region. A representative for DWS declined to comment. Prior to joining DWS as CEO in June 2022, Hoops had little experience in asset management. He was brought in to steady the ship after a period of tumult surrounding allegations that the investment firm overstated its green credentials. Now the faltering private credit business has come as a major setback for him. At Deutsche Bank, Hoops caught the attention of CEO Christian Sewing with his cool head when Germany’s biggest lender was facing the threat of a costly settlement in the US. As head of the corporate clients unit that was central to Sewing’s turnaround plan, Hoops oversaw a rebound in the business that was struggling for a long time with negative interest rates. Hoops also scored some wins at DWS, including settling with US regulators probing allegations of greenwashing. He oversaw a 16% rise in total assets under management to €963 billion at the end of September, driven by inflows into lower-margin passively managed funds. The company’s shares have outperformed European peers in recent years. Now, those credentials will be put to the test as Hoops faces one of the biggest challenges of his career: establishing the firm’s private credit business. The alternatives unit of DWS, which is reporting full-year results on Jan. 30, looks unlikely to achieve its goal of a 10% compounded annual growth until the end of 2025, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The unit had €106 billion in assets under management at the end of September, down from €123 billion in 2022, when Hoops took over. The only bright spot of the alternatives unit in recent years has been its infrastructure business, which has attracted consistent inflows. In a bid to build out the unit, the firm did make some star hires. Paul Kelly joined from Blackstone Inc. in 2022 to run the alternatives unit. It also brought in Man Group Plc’s Dan Robinson as its EMEA alternative credit head. The business is currently launching its first collateralized loan obligation, Rhine CLO I. To be sure, Hoops told analysts in October that he expects the investments in alternatives to pay back over the longer term and promised a “packed agenda” for 2025. But the lack of fundraising has weighed on the business. A weak track record is making it even more difficult to mobilize capital, the people said. Getting clients to invest in DWS’s private credit offerings is also challenging because most customers prefer better established players over the new kid on the block, one person said. As a result, the division has seen some attrition among sales staff. Nestanlin Garcia, who oversaw alternatives client coverage in Germany, Austria and central eastern Europe, left for Blackstone in November. Alexander Hütteroth, who oversaw private debt coverage in the region, joined Brookfield Asset Management, their LinkedIn profiles show. Should organic growth fail to materialize, Hoops might revisit a list of potential acquisition targets of European asset managers with direct lending capabilities. Any deal size would be in the low to mid-single digit billion range, Bloomberg News has reported. DWS has also been among suitors that were studying a bid for German life insurance consolidator Viridium Group. The group of potential bidders also included BlackRock Inc. and Blackstone, Bloomberg News reported in October. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

January 24, 2025 05:19 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 24 January 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced topline results from a phase 1b/2a clinical trial with amycretin, a unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist intended for once weekly subcutaneous administration. The trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and proof-of-concept after once-weekly subcutaneous administrations of amycretin in 125 people with overweight or obesity. The trial was a combined single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose and dose-response trial investigating three different maintenance doses with a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was treatment emergent adverse events. The safety profile of amycretin was consistent with incretin-based therapies. The most common adverse events with amycretin were gastrointestinal and the vast majority were mild to moderate in severity. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 92.7 kg, people treated with amycretin achieved an estimated body weight loss of 9.7% on 1.25mg (20 weeks), 16.2% on 5mg (28 weeks) and 22.0% on 20mg (36 weeks). People treated with placebo experienced an estimated 1.9%, 2.3% and 2.0% body weight gain, respectively. “We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk is now planning further clinical development of amycretin in adults with overweight or obesity. About amycretinAmycretin is a unimolecular long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist under development by Novo Nordisk, to provide an efficacious and convenient treatment for adults with overweight or obesity and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes.

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Africa content team has reshuffled with ex-Amazon exec Kaye-Ann Williams brought in to oversee TV and movies as Tendeka Matatu exits. Williams takes on the newly-created Director of Scripted Content role and will focus on local productions, overseeing a team that develops and creates African original films and series. She joins after a short stint as content boss at The Traitors South Africa producer Primedia Studios and is a former Head of Scripted Series and Movies at Prime Video/Amazon Studios, where she focused on South Africa. Commencing her role next month, Williams will report to Ben Amadasun, Netflix’s Vice President of Middle East & Africa Content.

No word on Matatu’s next move but we are told he is pursuing other opportunities. His credits included Heart of the Hunter and Kandasamys: The Baby. Amadasun credited Williams with helping creative talent “create some of the most ambitious projects on African television.” “I’m delighted to welcome Kaye-Ann to the team as we strengthen our long-term commitment to African storytelling,” he added. “I look forward to working alongside her to further build on the wonderful work the team has done so far to deliver compelling stories from Africa and to nurture our many local creative partnerships.” Amazon cut funding in Africa and made layoffs last year and sources from the local sector had recently questioned whether Netflix was heading in the same direction, with rumors of shows being pulled. Netflix pushed back, noting that it is “strengthening its investment in African storytelling” and pointing to Williams’ stellar credentials. Since kickstarting local African commissioning with 2020’s Queen Sono, Netflix cited significant deals struck with the likes of Silverton Siege’s Mandla Dube and Jayan Moodley, creator of the Kandasamys franchise. At the recent MIP Africa in Cape Town, Amadasun unveiled a trio of new movies along with a Blood Legacy series from Blood & Water producer Gambit Films and reality show Love Never Lies: South Africa. The news comes off the back of a strong week for Netflix. The streaming powerhouse smashed estimates by adding nearly 19 million subscribers in Q4 – the final quarter for which it will report these numbers.

Title: ‘We are treated like ‘boat people:’ Indian techies alarmed by Trump’s bros
URL: https://www.rt.com/india/611509-indians-us-h1b-uncertainty-trump/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T09:05:09Z

On a pleasant January morning in Bengaluru, known globally as the Silicon Valley of India, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti opened a new consulate, the fifth in the South Asian nation. In three days, the Joe Biden appointee would step down, paving the way for the Trump 2.0 administration to choose his replacement. Speaking at the event, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called it a “new milestone” in bilateral relations, particularly in sectors like technology, space, defense, and education. “As we enter an era of AI, EVs, drones, biotechnology, and advanced space exploration, our partnership will increasingly be defined by innovation. Bengaluru, as India’s tech capital, and [the state of] Karnataka, as a hub of innovation, will play crucial roles in this journey,” Jaishankar said. Three days later, on January 20, he would be attending the swearing-in ceremony of US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. Later, he would engage the newly appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the issue of “irregular immigration” and visa policy regarding the millions of Indian professionals in the US. On that January day, around 8,000 miles away, in a Boston suburb, N. Ranganathan, a 36-year-old software techie working as a software analyst, was visibly upset with a leading aircraft manufacturer. He, his wife and their three-year-old son were in for a hard realization about the US being “a land of dreams.” “I have been in this country for the last seven years and with my son having been born here, I was hoping that my son gets naturalized citizenship. With the latest ruling by the president, I am not sure whether I and my family want to be [here], as we feel disrespected about the fact that despite paying taxes as well as contributing to the US economy, we are treated like ‘boat people’ (refugees).” Like Ranganathan, millions of Indians face the dilemma of whether to continue working in the US or seek alternative options. US President Donald Trump began his term in office with sweeping executive orders, including one ending birthright citizenship for children whose parents are neither American citizens nor permanent residents. This could affect over a million Indians waiting for green cards – with some of them locked in a bureaucratic backlog for a decade. However, broader concern over Trump’s visa policies during his second term is something that is being discussed both among the diaspora in the US and back in Bengaluru and other Indian tech hubs. India’s $250 billion IT outsourcing industry is at a critical juncture – and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the biggest challenge. In December, social media was boiling after billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Their statements sparked an online spat between anti-immigration Trump loyalists and the tech-oriented conservative faction. The US tech industry, which is facing layoffs, relies on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of IT professionals – mainly from India (over 72%), as well as China and other nations. Supporters claim that H-1B workers address essential skill shortages and foster innovation, while opponents argue that the program keeps wages low and displaces US employees. Musk, who himself is a South African immigrant who once held an H-1B visa, said he was in favor of bringing “the top ~0.1% of engineering talent” via a legal route as it is “essential for America to keep winning.” He also told critics to “go f*** yourself in the face,” referring to them as “subtards.” Musk has long argued for increased immigration and greater opportunities for skilled workers to live and work in the US, often pointing out that the country’s long-term success depends on attracting the best and brightest talent globally. The online standoff came days after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule aimed at ‘reforming’ the H-1B program to help American companies address critical workforce shortages. The new rule looks to simplify the approval process, enhancing flexibility for employers to retain skilled workers, and strengthen the program’s oversight and integrity. Additionally, on December 27th, the US Department of State announced the completion of a successful pilot program to let people renew H-1B visas without having to leave the country. This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, the Department of State said, promising to establish a US-based renewal program in 2025. At around the same time, President Trump announced the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born venture capitalist, to lead artificial intelligence policy. In the past, Krishnan had supported the removal of country caps on green cards for skilled immigrants in the US. This was too much for some MAGA supporters, who feel that this visa system needs to be scrapped as it doesn’t add any value to the US economy and instead takes away the jobs of people who have similar qualifications. In some cases, American workers who were laid off were forced to train their H-1B counterparts. If they failed to do so, they risked losing their severance pay. Federal lawsuits were filed by two of the tech workers laid off from the Walt Disney Co. One of them even testified before a Senate Committee. The war of words on H-1B was not limited to social media. There have been racist attacks against Indians on the TV and in real life. Fox News carried an interview with a commentator who openly referred to Indians as “third world parasites.” Immediately after the online fracas between Musk and other MAGA supporters, Trump came to Elon’s defense. In an interview with the New York Post, he praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the US. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. Speaking at a press conference at the White House after taking office, Trump said “I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country, even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have the qualifications they do,” he said while addressing a joint press conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. “We have to have quality people coming in. Now by doing that, we’re expanding businesses and that takes care of everybody. So I’m sort of on both sides of the argument, but what I really do feel is that we have to let really competent people, great people, come into our country. And we do that through the H-1B program,” he added. This marked a U-turn on H-1B visas for Trump; in 2016 he called them "very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, he imposed a temporary ban on the visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. The question for those whose lives and profits revolve around H-1B visas remains open – how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech? The H-1B visa program, which started in 1990, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that typically require a high level of technical expertise (fields such as IT, engineering, and healthcare). The visa is initially granted for three years, and can be extended by another three years. Every year, 85,000 such visas are up for grabs, through a lottery system. Major tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Qualcomm Technologies, Ernst and Young, as well as outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, HCL America and others heavily rely on H-1B visas. Indian companies, who swarmed the US in large numbers at the height of the dotcom boom-in the 1990s are the biggest beneficiaries of H-1B visas.In May 2024, according to US State Department data from 2022, as much as 77% of 320,000 H-1B visa applications went to Indians. Indian companies are taking measures to counter any negative pushback with regard to H-1B visas, by hiring locals. For India’s second-largest information technology company Infosys, over 60% of the workforce in the US now comprises locals, Infosys’ Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka told media recently. TCS CEO Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that a decrease in H-1B visas can be offset by other strategies, such as relocating work to India, reducing the overall reliance on H-1B. From the first time Trump took charge in 2016, the US authorities have clamped down on frauds related to applications from H-1B, increased the cost of filings [upwards of $8,000] and even limited repeated filings, in an effort to make the system fair. As a result, people can no longer submit multiple applications to increase their chances of winning the lottery, as this creates an unfair advantage. The crackdown on frauds seemed to have worked to some extent. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] revealed that the number of entries for the year’s lottery stood at 470,342, marking a substantial 38% decline from the 758,994 entries received in 2023, according to a report by the Associated Press. Since December, both Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, seem to have offered their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the program needs a fix. “Easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically. I’ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,” Musk said days after telling critics to “go f*** yourself.” Immigrant attorneys believe that unlike the past, this time things may actually change. “The system is broken and it needs to be fixed, especially around the area of what is considered to be a job/service that cannot be done by a local and requires a special visa,” an attorney from a Washington-based law firm told RT. Meanwhile, India has used diplomatic language to advocate for favorable visa policies while emphasizing mutual benefits and India’s indispensable role in the partnership. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in early January, breaking his silence on the H-1B debate. Industry watchers believe that H-1B visas can still address the basic issues which led to its creation in the first place, i.e. supplying engineers to met tech’s gargantuan demands. “The H-1B program, which is based on numerical limits set over 30 years ago, still remains terribly short of meeting the needs of the US economy in the global competition for talent, particularly in STEM fields,” believes Ashank Desai, Principal Founder and former Chairman of Mastek as well as founding member of Indian software lobby firm NASSCOM. Ganesh Natarajan, Executive Chairman and Founder of 5F World, and formerly CEO of Zensar, a Pune-based outsourcing firm, told RT the H-1B mindset needs to change “from wage arbitrage to quality of talent. In many ways, it needs to evolve.” Ultimately, the next move of the Trump administration will significantly impact India’s exports. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India’s total exports reached $776.68 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. Software exports alone account for about 4% of the country’s GDP and generate approximately 5.4 million direct jobs and nearly 20 million indirect jobs. Therefore, any changes to visa policies are likely to affect India’s export landscape.

Title: Crypto Venture Capital Funding to Rise This Year, Won't Hit Previous Highs: JPMorgan

Crypto venture capital (VC) funding is expected to recover this year as regulatory clarity and more crypto-friendly policies emerge during the tenure of President Donald Trump, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The Wall Street bank noted that venture funding for the industry has been subdued in recent years. This may have been due to enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the climate of regulatory uncertainty during the previous administration, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The start of the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which came into force at the end of December, is expected to "further bolster VC engagement," the report said. Still, the level of funding is unlikely to match previous peaks seen in 2021/22, JPMorgan said, as crypto venture capital firms face a number of challenges. Giants of traditional finance (TradFi) such as Blackrock (BLK) and Franklin Templeton are increasing their participation in the crypto market, and this leaves less market share for VC firms in stablecoins, tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), the bank said. Nascent crypto projects are avoiding large token sales to VCs and are increasingly turning to community-driven platforms to raise money, the report noted. High interest rates also present a challenge for VC funding, JPMorgan said. The growth of cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) products is "inducing a trend towards passive investing," and this could be diverting capital away from VC firms, the report added.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS)'s all-share buyout offer for Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) on Friday is the latest surprise twist of an increasingly complex banking saga. Long-awaited Italian banking consolidation has taken off in recent months, triggered by the state selling down its stake in MPS in November, paving the way for a third big banking group to compete with Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit. The latter, not wanting to be left out of a wave of deal making, late last year made its own unsolicited play for Banco BPM, Italy's third-largest lender. The situation is made more complex by key shareholders in the banks involved owning stakes in other lenders as well as Italian insurer Generali (BIT:GASI). Those shareholders include Delfin, the holding company of late billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, and entrepreneur Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone.

Several parties are in contention even as potential buyers face a litany of legal hurdles and barriers. After stepping in to restore TikTok in the U.S. and delaying a law that would effectively ban the app, Trump is looking for avenues to keep the popular platform afloat. He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50% stake to the U.S. government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world's richest person is leading Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok's CEO had been soliciting advice from Musk ahead of Trump's inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Musk for comment. "Elon Musk continues to be front and center as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done," Wedbush said in a research note on Wednesday. "Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view," the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Musk's acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, he also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. "Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny," Schindler said. Trump has also said he'd "like" to see Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform. Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans on Tuesday, where Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. "What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we'll give you the permit," Trump said before turning to Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. "Sounds like a good deal to me Mr. President," Ellison replied. Ellison and his company are currently at the center of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the U.S. Given its existing relationship with Tiktok, Oracle and is "directly invested in Tiktok's success in the region," Scotiabank's Schindler said. Ellison had bid for Tiktok, along with Walmart, back in 2020 when Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comment. Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would've seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the U.S., avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration's attempt to ban TikTok in the U.S. fell through in the face of legal challenges. Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Elon Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. "[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate," Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Musk and Ellison leading the pack. In addition to Musk and Ellison, experts flagged several other parties likely to be interested in a potential deal for TikTok, adding that the barriers to entry were high. Given the financial stakes of a TikTok deal, it's unlikely that some rogue investor is going to swoop in and buy the platform on the cheap, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group told CNBC. "While an up-to-date valuation on TikTok is difficult to come up with, it is likely to the order of $40-80 billion, meaning whoever decides to jump in has to be ready with some serious money," he said. He added that potential suitors are likely to include some of America's largest social media and technology players, such as Meta and Google, in addition to Musk's X. Meta and Google didn't immediately respond to a CNBC inquiry. Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, however, warned that players such as Meta, Google and Musk getting a substantial stake in TikTok could raise antitrust questions. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler noted that there were also a number of other players, including existing investors BlackRock, Coatue, and General Atlantic, who own a large chunk of TikTok's parent company. According to him, some of these investors are likely to participate in any sale of the U.S. platform by investing in the new entity. "Other large VCs, hedge funds, and asset managers from Tiger to Fidelity would also likely show interest in a fast growing global platform with such a huge viewer base," said Schindler, adding that finding investors to own a part of Tiktok won't be a problem. The fervor surrounding a purchase of TikTok U.S. has also seen some unconventional players enter the fray. Social media superstar MrBeast — real name Jimmy Donaldson — who has more than 100 million TikTok followers has posted several videos in which he indicated serious interest in buying the platform, claiming he has had talks with billionaires. In one video, the internet personality claimed he had an official offer ready, jesting that he might be the new TikTok CEO. Media reports have also mentioned Donaldson and a group of investors preparing to make a bid for TikTok. On Thursday, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesperson for Donaldson, told CNBC that "Several potential buyers are in ongoing discussions with Jimmy, but he has no exclusive agreements with any of them." Led by Project Liberty Founder Frank McCourt and involving Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O'Leary, "The People's Bid for TikTok," has made a $20 billion cash offer to buy TikTok. O'Leary told CNBC last year that he wanted to buy the platform at a discount as any possible deal won't include TikTok's original algorithm. The organization said it already has a replacement for the algorithm to use for TikTok U.S. Following Trump's comments on a 50% stake in the platform, both McCourt and O'Leary told CNBC this week that they were interested in a TikTok deal and were hoping to work with Trump to make it happen. McCourt has also told CNBC that he wants TikTok to run a decentralized social networking protocol, or DSNP, overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, a nonprofit founded by the billionaire. Bidding interest aside, a number of legal and tech experts have told CNBC that Trump's executive order to delay the TikTok ban contradicts the Supreme Court's earlier ruling to uphold the PAFACA and could face legal opposition. O'Leary also told CNBC on Monday that a TikTok deal could not happen under the current law, after the Supreme Court upheld an impending ban on TikTok under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, or PAFACA, on Sunday. Beijing and its pending negotiations with Trump regarding trade with the U.S. is also expected to play a determining factor in whether the Chinese government would allow ByteDance to make a divestiture. "In this game of high stakes poker between the Trump Administration and Beijing it's clear TikTok is a big chip on the table," Wedush said Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Bank of Japan hikes ratesThe Bank of Japan on Friday hiked rates by 25 basis points to 0.5%, the highest level since 2008. Following the decision, the Japanese yen strengthened to 155.3 against the U.S. dollar as of 1:30 p.m. Singapore time. Earlier Friday, Tokyo released a report that showed core inflation in the country rising to a 16-month high at 3% in December on an annual basis, in line with expectations from a Reuters poll. Record close for S&PThe S&P 500 closed at a fresh high on Thursday as investors liked what they heard from Trump regarding rate cuts. All major U.S. benchmarks are on a four-day winning streak. Positive Wall Street sentiment lifted Asian markets on Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped more than 2%, but Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down after the rate hike. Trump's Davos addressU.S. President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, virtually on Thursday. In his speech, Trump said he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately," ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to "bring down the cost of oil," and called the European Union's trade relationship with the U.S. very unfair. Trump said he likes Xi "very much"Trump said Thursday that he likes Chinese President Xi Jinping "very much," according to the White House readout of his virtual interview at Davos. He floated the idea of working with Xi to end the war in Ukraine. Separately, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China released Thursday found that 30% of U.S. companies in China are accelerating their plans to relocate manufacturing or sourcing, the highest proportion since 2022. Crypto order signed by TrumpCryptocurrency advocates got another boost from Trump on Thursday after he signed an executive order to promote the advancement of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Most of the order focuses on establishing technology and rules around crypto. One of the critical pieces is the creation of a working group to consider a national digital asset stockpile. Boeing projects huge lossBoeing said Thursday that it likely lost about $4 billion in the fourth quarter, or a loss of $5.46 per share. Revenue will probably come in at $15.2 billion, lower than LSEG estimates. Boeing has not posted an annual profit since 2018. The aircraft maker began 2024 with a midair accident and ended it with a crippling labor strike and layoffs. [PRO] Fink goes against pessimism in EuropeThere's severe "pessimism" about the future of Europe at Davos, according to Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock. However, Fink told CNBC on Thursday things might be "near a bottom" — and explains why he's taking that view. Markets are supposed to run on numbers: past performance, projections of profits, return on equity. But words are equally powerful in their capacity to move markets, as Trump's virtual address to the World Economic Forum on Thursday demonstrated. The price of U.S. crude and the global benchmark Brent dropped on Trump saying he'd "ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil." And after Trump said he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately," the 2-year Treasury yield, which tends to track short-term interest rates, edged lower, while stocks ticked up. In fact, the S&P 500 added 0.53% to close at a record closing high of 6,118.71. Its last all-time closing high was 6,090.27 in early December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.92% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.22%. It was the fourth consecutive session in the green for all three indexes. But unlike numbers — which are factual (most of the time, anyway) — words can be capricious. "Trump's Davos speech contained some ostensibly positive lines (he called for OPEC to lower oil prices, demanded central banks lower interest rates, and reiterated prior pledges to slash taxes and regulation) but there was very little either incremental or within his control," Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. That doesn't mean Trump won't carry through his declarations. It's unwise, however, to bank on comments ungrounded by concrete action. On the other hand, there are some words that have the heft of policy behind them and should be taken seriously by investors. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week. While the chance of a rate cut then is near zero, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch Tool, what Chair Jerome Powell says at his press conference is "likely to cause market volatility," according to James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. Learning what to listen to, then, could be as important for investors as deciphering numbers. — CNBC's Alex Harring and Jesse Pound contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Yuno Energy CEO Cathal Fay: ‘Starting from zero, €600m in revenues is not so bad’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/01/24/cathal-fay-interview/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T05:45:00Z

Energy supplier Yuno started life in 2010 as “four middle-aged men above a second-hand bookshop in Blackrock”, Co Dublin. “We had an idea, an electricity licence and not much else,” recalls its chief executive and co-founder, Cathal Fay. It was not the most auspicious year to start a business. An economic recession sparked by the collapse of the property market and the banks gripped the country. But the timing turned out to be good for Fay and his colleagues. Their idea was Prepay Power, pay as you go electricity, which allowed people to pay small amounts as they needed, instead of wrestling with big bills. “Ireland was a different place then,” Fay observes. “People responded well to the offer. You pay in small amounts when it suits rather than pay a big bill, and at that stage a big bill every two months was a big ask for consumers. They liked the fact that they could break it down, typically €20, down the shop. We got a great reaction to that.” Prepay went from zero to 2,000 customers by the end of 2011, then 12,000, then 20,000. Even when it ran out of cash to advertise, people kept coming. Its main constraint was getting finance to fund growth. Despite demonstrating that the idea worked, a year of dealing with advisors and meeting “various people around town” failed to get a result. Fay got an introduction through family to Ulric Kenny, then best known as founder of Ion Equity, whom he approached for advice. Instead, Kenny joined as an investor bringing along colleague Andrew Collins. He is the biggest shareholder and company chairman today. “That was a bit of luck,” says Fay. “Not just his investment, but we also got his business insights. He’s been a great chairman of the company.” Yuno is a different place these days. It has swapped the bookshop for an office in Sandyford on the capital’s southside. It has just bought Firmus Energy (Supply) Ltd in Northern Ireland, in a deal thought to be worth around €40 million. That brought in 113,000 homes and businesses, bringing its total customer numbers to more than 400,000. It now employs 600 people, and revenues will soon reach €600 million. In 2023, Yuno’s sales were €373 million while operating profits were €4.3 million. It supplies electricity, gas and home heating oil to customers. Along with Prepay, it has Yuno Energy, a bill-pay supplier. Prepay will continue as a mainstay of the business, but most future growth will come under the “Yuno banner”, Fay predicts. It plans to invest in the bill-pay operation and in recruiting commercial customers. Firmus is already the North’s leading supplier to business and state bodies. We ran out of meters when we were just about to grow. We survived without paying ourselves while we were waiting for investment In the south, Yuno has hired Ian Mulcahy, a 20-year industry veteran, to head up the section offering electricity and gas to businesses. That has been so far so good, according to Fay. “We’re getting on well in terms of meeting our launch targets in commercial customers,” he says, without revealing the numbers. “It’s an interesting contrast. One client brings a lot of gigawatt hours. They’re more dedicated customers, they can choose their own hedging strategies. We advise them and they decide whether they want to go to market or a fixed-rate for the year. So, we’re adjusting to bringing in the expertise, not just a head of department but also key account staff.” Yuno’s business customers can take a pass-through rate, tied to wholesale electricity market prices, which change every half hour, a fixed price for the year, or “any number of products in between”. The company has recruited some big customers, including well-known Irish retailer Smyth’s Toys. On the domestic side, its bill-pay business in the Republic has recruited 35,000 customers since its launch in late 2023. The company maintains that those who buy both electricity and gas save around €900 a year, compared to rivals’ standard rates if they switch, while electricity only customers are €500 better off. Prepay clients pay rates comparable to the standards on offer elsewhere, but benefit from a better service, Fay says. Yuno does not own power plants or gas reservoirs. Instead, it buys its energy on the open market, selling it on at a profit. But it does not buy at the wholesale price on offer at any given time: it agrees deals for electricity and gas months, or even a year or more, in advance of taking delivery, a process known as hedging. This is meant to cut out the risks of constant up and down movement in prices. Fay cites what happened in August 2022 as a good example of how this works. Electricity prices briefly rose to 10 times historic norms, as fear that there would not be enough gas to generate power gripped Europe. Anyone buying then would have had to pay the massively inflated price, but hedging agreements allowed suppliers such as Yuno to avoid this. It had bought a year earlier, when the electricity market was emerging from “the situation where energy prices had been low, so you could buy it at a low price for delivery in 12 months’ time”. However, Fay concedes that those forward prices are tied to what happens at the wholesale level, so homes and businesses still face increases and decreases, but without the dramatic peaks and troughs seen on the wholesale market. “Absolutely, yeah. You can’t beat the market,” he says. “What you’re doing is trying to remove volatility.” Essentially, success in the business hinges on getting the hedging strategy right. Yuno has 30 people working in its trading department, equating to 5 per cent of its employees. Its bill-pay business was launched as the pressure on prices eased in late 2023, allowing it to offer lower rates than rivals committed to hedging contracts struck at higher levels. Electricity prices are tied to gas, as this is the fuel used to generate most of the power used in Europe. They have been falling, but now there is a risk that they will head in the other direction. Russia recently shut a pipeline through Ukraine that provided around 5 per cent of Europe’s natural gas needs. This was expected, but it came during a cold snap when demand was already high, so price has been moving up steadily. We had an idea, an electricity licence and not much else “Well, gas went up 25 per cent in December,” Fay says. “This winter has been colder and calmer than last winter, so that means more demand for gas for heating, and calmer means more demand for gas for power generation. The market has been tight and nervous, so prices have gone up – really driven by the fact that in the colder, calmer conditions, gas storage is 15 per cent less than this time last year and less than the five-year average.” Europe competes with south-east Asia for gas supplies. In the medium term, volatility looks likely to continue, particularly as the continent will have to spend the summer replenishing its reduced gas stores, so pressure will remain on prices even as demand from homes and businesses subsides. While no one is likely to increase charges now, Fay maintains that all suppliers, his own company included, are watching this closely. Fay’s background as a qualified engineer clearly helps him grasp the various moving parts of the business he runs. After getting his primary degree from University College Dublin, he did a Master’s in computer applications in Trinity, and then went to work with Telecom Eireann, now Eircom. He left in 2000, moving to a company that produced ebooks and productivity software for personal organisers. “I found there that it was all about first-mover advantage, getting things to market quickly. We were first mover, but we found that there wasn’t a market,” he says. Then he worked with Red Circle, which developed ringtones and games for pre-smart phone mobiles. Strangely, this business was all about print advertising. “We’d take out a page in a magazine in the UK,” he says. “We’d know exactly how to optimise each centimetre of that space to maximise the number of ringtones that people bought. That gave us a significant advantage, so we grew big in the UK.” Red Circle was then sold to Irish company Zamano. Fay remained on until 2010, at which point the iPhone had taken over, so ringtones and games were all app-based. Around that time, he ran into a former colleague who was involved in pre-paid energy, prompting him to realise it could work here. Shortly afterwards, he made the move to the second-hand bookshop. Yuno is about to expand in yet another direction, district heating. This comes in two forms. One is a self-contained system where an apartment building is served by a single common boiler, which tenants draw on as needed, through heat exchangers in their homes. Yuno is already involved in such projects. The other is known as “networked” district heating, which draws heat from a single source to a group of buildings in the one area. In the Irish case, this would be industries such as data centres and pharmaceutical manufacturers, which generate quantities of wasted heat. District heating is common in Nordic countries so the systems for tapping it are tried and tested. Applying it here means that everybody wins, says Fay. It means a cheap source of heat for consumers, turning waste into revenue for the industries involved, which must pay for cooling, and cutting carbon emissions, as both the homes and the manufacturers are drawing on the same energy. You can’t beat the market. What you’re doing is trying to remove volatility The State’s climate action plan includes a commitment to this technology, but it needs infrastructure, ie, pipes connecting the data centres and pharma makers with apartment blocks and homes. Theoretically, that should not be difficult, as many of the industries are close enough to residential areas. An existing pilot scheme connects an Amazon facility with homes in Tallaght in west Dublin. “We’ve looked at a number of case studies,” says Fay. “Even in my own local area in Dun Laoghaire, there is a pharmaceutical company that generates heat, and there are umpteen number of apartment buildings that will take it.” The Government and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland have identified suitable sites themselves. Yuno has already hired someone with experience of this in Denmark to run this division. The next steps involve the Oireachtas passing laws enabling it, and for local councils to go from there and lay the pipes. Fay says there are indications that this is going to happen. “It cries out to be done, because we have so many data centres around Dublin that being able to take the waste heat from them is a useful way of supporting them in meeting their own climate change mitigation goals. But you can see that it’s likely to be on a longer timeframe than what we’re used to,” he says. The slower pace does not seem to bother Fay unduly. He’s had “plenty of scares” on the way to this point, he says. “We ran out of meters when we were just about to grow, while people were still calling us, despite us not advertising. We survived without paying ourselves while we were waiting for investment. So €600 million in revenues is not so bad from starting from zero.” Name: Cathal Fay Post: Chief executive, Yuno Energy Career: Began working life as an engineer with a master in computer applications, worked for Telecom Eireann – now Eircom – before moving to a firm that developed software for personal organisers and then to Red Circle, which provided ringtones and games for pre-smart mobile phones.

Guess who’s back and buying more Bitcoin? It’s Blackrock taking a bolder approach to the world’s top digital asset. According to Arkham Intelligence’s recent tracking, BlackRock reportedly bought $600 million worth of Bitcoin on January 22nd, the most significant buy this year. Arkham added that this latest acquisition pushed the company’s holdings to 569,343 Bitcoins, currently valued at $58.32 billion. In addition to Bitcoin, BlackRock holds other digital assets, including 74.5 million USDC tokens, $3.7 billion worth of Ether, and coins like UBXS, Colle AI, MOG, TUA, and SPX6900. This year, BlackRock’s aggressive acquisition of Bitcoin got off to a scorching start. Lookonchain revealed on Twitter/X that among all funds, BlackRock’s iShares receive the most Bitcoin inflows. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust comes in next, with a total of 208 Bitcoins, then followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which acquired 165 Bitcoins on the same day.

Akr21 Shares was also a top performer in the last seven days, adding almost 4,000 Bitcoins to its holdings. BlackRock’s holdings also include other digital assets, including ETH. In the same data shared by LookonChain, BlackRock added around 58 ETH but lags behind the acquisition of VanEck, with its 732 ETH tokens purchased in the last seven days. Although BlackRock adds a substantial number of ETH tokens, its investments in Bitcoin matter to the industry. The company’s Bitcoin purchases are often a measure of the market’s performance. Since launching the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock has consistently led the segment with aggressive purchases. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Bitcoin: “If everyone adopted a 2% or 5% allocation, you could see Bitcoin at $700,000” Incredible how far Bitcoin has come. 🟠 pic.twitter.com/psxP3aq4WI — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) January 22, 2025 Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,000, a little lower than its closing price yesterday. Analysts are nonetheless optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory based on its recent success. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has shown confidence about the potential price of Bitcoin. Fink told the World Economic Forum that Bitcoin was becoming more and more popular with asset management companies and international investment funds. According to Fink, these companies desire BlackRock’s opinion on Bitcoin. If everyone owns Bitcoin and contributes 2% to 5%, the industry will reach $700k, Fink continued. In addition, Fink stressed that they are not endorsing Bitcoin, but rather highlighting its potential. Bitcoin could see some improvement under Trump, according to Samara Cohen, another BlackRock official. According to Cohen, Bitcoin is doing well in the market under Trump. Once regulations are clear, Cohen anticipates a banner year for Bitcoin. Featured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin’s Breakout At Davos: Global Elites Reckon With Crypto Revolution

U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) In a bold statement at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Donald Trump declared that the United States would soon become the "world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto," thanks to an imminent surge in American energy production. This proclamation marks a significant departure from the previous administration's heavy-handed regulations, which stifled both innovation and growth in the energy, bitcoin, and AI sectors. Trump’s statement, once unthinkable at Davos, was met with a notable shift in tone. In years past, discussions about bitcoin and pro-energy policies would have been dismissed in favor of elitist agendas centered around ESG mandates, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and expanding global surveillance efforts. But this year, the tone was different. Wall Street's biggest players are no longer laughing at bitcoin—instead, they’re making bold predictions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that bitcoin could soar to $700,000, while Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong pitched the idea of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to the governor of the central bank of South Africa. As the saying goes, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win.” The question now is, which stage are we in? President Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise this week by pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence without parole. Ulbricht’s case became a symbol of government overreach, with many in the bitcoin and libertarian communities rallying behind the call for his release. Trump framed the decision as a victory for liberty and personal sovereignty, key principles that align with the ethos of bitcoin itself. Following the announcement, bitcoin’s price responded positively, underscoring the growing recognition of Ulbricht as a martyr of the digital age. His story serves as a stark reminder of the fight for financial freedom and the perils of government overreach in a rapidly digitizing world. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s ongoing convulsions amid its identity crisis showed themselves again this week with the announcement of Etherealize, a new entity focused on institutional adoption. Though initial rumors suggested it was a second Ethereum Foundation, it was later revealed to be an Ethereum Foundation-backed initiative aimed at integrating Ethereum into traditional finance. Etherealize’s mission is to market Ethereum’s scaling solutions and staking yields to institutions, an effort to maintain relevance in the face of a severe, long-term decline in the exchange rate between BTC and ETH. However, Ethereum’s continued centralization and lack of fixed monetary policy leave it vulnerable to insider-driven strategies that stand in stark contrast to bitcoin’s Nakamoto Consensus. Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream has taken another step toward bridging traditional finance and bitcoin with the launch of its asset management division, unveiling two institutional-grade funds—the Blockstream Income Fund and the Blockstream Alpha Fund. These funds offer regulated access to bitcoin investments with a focus on collateralized lending and active management strategies. The move underscores bitcoin’s maturity as a financial asset and its growing role in institutional portfolios. As institutions seek exposure to bitcoin, products like these provide a bridge between traditional finance and the bitcoin ecosystem, leveraging its unique attributes without compromising its core principles. The speculative excesses of the crypto space were on full display this week with the launch of $TRUMP, a meme coin that briefly reached a staggering $14.5 billion market cap before crashing. With 80% of its supply concentrated in the hands of insiders, the rise and fall of $TRUMP served as a cautionary tale about the speculative frenzy that often grips altcoin markets. Although meme coins may be fun for some who enjoy gambling, they lack the fundamentals and staying power that constitute an asset worthy of investment. All of this activity comes at the same time as extremely bullish predictions from industry leaders. Some analysts suggest that bitcoin trading above $100,000 is akin to a coiled spring, poised for a significant upward breakout. As mentioned above, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink predicted that bitcoin could reach $700,000. Not to be outdone, David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. and key contributor to the Trump administration’s bitcoin strategy, targets a price of $1 million per coin within four years. The events at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, along with the unveiling of the Trump administration’s bitcoin policy, mark the beginning of a new era. The once-dismissed digital asset is now becoming recognized as a legitimate and vital component of the financial system. With geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and economic uncertainty on the rise, bitcoin’s value proposition has never been clearer. Whether it’s being used as a hedge against currency debasement, an investment vehicle for institutions, or a strategic reserve for sovereign states, bitcoin’s role is expanding at an unprecedented pace. The question is no longer if bitcoin will be widely adopted, but how quickly the transition will take place. As 2025 unfolds, one thing is certain: bitcoin’s march toward mainstream acceptance is well underway, and those paying attention stand to benefit the most. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Four bed bungalow in Blackrock with its own fruit trees is packed with happy history of four generations

This Co Dublin bungalow, which has stayed in the family since it was built in the 1940s, offers easy access to the sea and village, and its own fruit trees Ann Connolly Redmond and her daughter Rachael Fisher in the kitchen of the family's Blackrock home Pic. Bryan Meade Number 1 St Vincent's Park, Blackrock The living room One of the four bedrooms The kitchen The hallway 1 St Vincent’s Park, Blackrock, Co Dublin Asking price: €695,000 Agent: DNG (01) 283 2900 ​If Ann Connolly could bottle the homely authenticity of No 1 St Vincent’s Park in Blackrock, she could sell it by the bucketload with the business she works for, a lifestyle store where goods are taken home in repurposed cement bags and where the ethos is all about “the connections between makers and customers”. Connolly works for Amanda Pratt, who was part-owner owner and chief buyer of lifestyle brand Avoca before it was bought by global food service and facilities company Aramark. Pratt recently opened Amo & Pax, a lifestyle outlet in Kilmacanogue, Co Wicklow, which sells furnishings and accessories that wouldn’t look out of place in Connolly’s family home. It all seems “full circle-ish”. Connolly’s uncle Brendan built a business around local shops: Doyle’s hardware and toy shops – of which there were six, including one in Dun Laoghaire and another in Parnell Street in the city centre. Another uncle, Paddy, had a supermarket in Gelnageary and greengrocers in Dalkey and Sandymount. But, of course, you can’t buy family history. The apple trees and rhubarb crowns planted in the back garden of No 1 by Conolly’s grandmother remain productive to this day. The collective energy and memories of four generations of her family infuse the atmosphere of the post-WWII bungalow near Blackrock village. Here, light-touch improvements carried out over generations have given it the sort of burlap-and-treasure-box character lifestyle store owners dream of. The living room Connolly now lives in Bray and travels constantly to trade shows as part of her job with Pratt, with whom she has worked since the Avoca days. Meanwhile, she has also been tasked with the job of divesting the property that has been home to her family for four generations. It isn’t an easy one. “It is so heartbreaking,” she says. “It has so many stories. “Unfortunately, my mother passed away last February. She was 93 years of age, but she had been in a nursing home for the last four years with dementia. My dad died in 2017, when he was 84. My lovely daughter, Rachel Fisher, has lovingly minded No 1 for the past few years and has looked after the apple trees and all the loganberries, whilst sea-swimming almost every day down in Seapoint, which is a really short cycle away.” Connolly’s family saga on this patch of ground goes right back to chapter one. The home her grandparents moved into in the late 1940s was built by The Daughters of Charity, whose convent, Dunardagh, possessed large tracts of land in this area of south Co Dublin, where the nuns had been heavily involved with health care and social services since the mid-1800s. One of the four bedrooms In the middle of the 20th century, the perennial Irish problem of a shortage of family homes was as familiar an issue then as it is now. “There were six families living up in Dunardagh,” Connolly says. “And I don’t really know why but my granny and granddad, Ellen and Joseph Doyle, were one of those families and basically the nuns commissioned 40 houses to be built at St Vincent’s Park, of which my grandparents had first dibs. “They picked No 1, because my granny originated from Co Offaly and she wanted a patch that she could plant apples and have a few chickens. The big apple tree in the back garden has to be 70 years old. Her loganberries are still there too. She was a great gardener and loved to cook. Everyone always ate well in this house.” The kitchen The Doyles went on to raise two girls and five boys in what was then a three-bedroom house. They extended the house over time, adding a kitchen at first, then an indoor bathroom – the first house in the estate to have one – and later a granny flat. For her part, Connolly was born and spent her very early life in England, where her parents Peggy and Gerry had moved. She was five when they came on holiday to Ireland and ended up staying after Ellen, her grandmother, became unwell. “So then we just grew up in Blackrock, and it was fantastic,” she says. “We would saunter down to the sea and be jumping off diving boards, strolling back, going into the sweet shops. “My brother and I would be sent to get the messages on a Saturday morning, and we would have our list – go to the butchers, and the fish shops and so on. Our neighbours in No 2, the O’Briens, owned the local fruit and veg shop.” The now 1,130sq ft semi-detached bungalow is on a corner plot in a cul-de-sac off Temple Road. It currently has four bedrooms, an entrance porch, a living room, a kitchen/dining room, a bathroom and a guest toilet. The fourth bedroom – originally the granny flat – is now connected to the main building. Number 1 St Vincent's Park, Blackrock There is a side entrance to the back garden and a well-tended front garden populated with rose bushes and other shrubs. While you cannot park directly outside the house, there is on-street parking and a small green, where older children might like to play. The house currently has oil-fired heating and a building energy rating of F, which the next owners may want to improve on. The interior is tastefully decorated in neutral colours, set off by selected furniture and accessories. The living room has polished timber floors and a fireplace with a wood-effect stove. The kitchen/ diner is bright and overlooks the back garden and granny’s apple tree. It has a chequerboard floor and green storage presses. For wannabee Blackrock residents, getting in there is difficult and expensive these days. Out of roughly 50 listings currently on myhome.ie, for example, only 20 are valued at under €800,000. Three-bed terraced townhouses are currently asking in the region of €550,000 whilst some semis are asking upwards of €775,000. Number 1 St Vincent’s Park has an asking price of €695,000 with DNG.

"I think we have to expect that President Trump will say something every day that gets a ton of coverage," he said. "We need to monitor these statements, but, look, we can't expect all of them to generate actionable investing ideas, even if they do produce bullish animal spirits that boost the market." Cramer encouraged investors to take some of the president's big-picture proclamations with a grain of salt, saying such broad ideas aren't what usually move the market. He also said that some of Trump's plans might not play out at face value, he continued, such as the president's sweeping energy policy meant to encourage drilling. Oil producers may not immediately take advantage of these allowances, Cramer said, and so the wider group isn't investible just yet. And Trump's demands to lower interest rates hold little weight, Cramer continued, as the Federal Reserve makes those decisions. The president would need to shrink the budget deficit to send rates lower, Cramer added. But Trump can invoke some catalysts, Cramer said, and he pointed to White House's recent announcement that it's partnering with Big Tech names like Oracle and Nvidia to invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The major data center buildout verifies the demand for products from companies like Nvidia, he continued. One theme poised to see lasting success is banks, Cramer said, due to Trump's proclivity for deregulation. BlackRock is tied to the bull market Trump wants to fuel, he said, and Goldman Sachs stands to benefit from increased merger activity. However, Trump's criticism of Bank of America for supposedly refusing to serve conservatives is not an investible idea, Cramer continued. The bank denied the accusation. "Trump wants the banks to succeed, and a higher stock market is the badge he craves," he said. "Even if he's saying bad things about Bank of America." The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment. Click here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

The shares were sold at a price of $1,010 each on January 21, 2025. Following this transaction, Kushel holds 68,433.34 shares directly. The transaction occurred as BlackRock, with its impressive $157 billion market capitalization, maintains a strong financial health score according to InvestingPro data. Additionally, Kushel exercised stock options to acquire 10,000 shares at a price of $513.50 per share. This transaction added $5.135 million to his holdings, which now total 78,433.34 shares. Kushel's indirect holdings include shares managed through various family trusts. The stock has delivered a robust 31.5% return over the past year, while maintaining its 22-year streak of consistent dividend payments. These transactions reflect Kushel's ongoing management of his equity position in BlackRock, a leading investment management corporation headquartered in New York.

Discover more insights about BlackRock's valuation and growth prospects in the comprehensive Pro Research Report, available exclusively to InvestingPro subscribers. In other recent news, BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink has publicly advocated for the tokenization of bonds and stocks, a move that could potentially democratize investing. This follows BlackRock's impressive earnings report, with adjusted operating earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93, surpassing both Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' (KBW) and consensus estimates. KBW has consequently increased its price target on BlackRock shares and maintained an Outperform rating. In addition, BlackRock's strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 has led to a positive outlook from Citi, highlighting accelerating fee growth and flow strength. The firm experienced a 7% growth in base fees during this period, with revenue growth of 10.2%. However, BlackRock also announced the resignation of Mark Wiedman, head of the Global Client Business, a significant change in the firm's leadership team. JPMorgan has responded to these recent developments by raising BlackRock's price target while maintaining a Neutral stock rating. These are among the recent developments concerning BlackRock.

Title: There’s Still Money to Be Made at Sundance — Or So Producers Hope

Kicking off its 11-day run Thursday and showcasing 88 feature films painstakingly selected from a record-high 16,000 submissions this year, the Sundance Film Festival remains a sui generis staging ground for the kind of buzzy, splashy titles that tend to explode out of Park City and ripple across popular culture. The mordant, Rose Byrne-starring dramedy If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, with its Conan O’Brien cameo? Director Bill Condon’s remake of the novel adaptation-turned-Broadway musical-turned-Oscar-winning 1985-drama Kiss of the Spider Woman, co-starring Jennifer Lopez? Director David France’s documentary Free Leonard Peltier which premieres just days after President Biden actually freed the well-known Indigenous activist (who was convicted of killing two FBI agents and spent the last five decades behind bars)? Any or all of them could become inescapable water-cooler conversation over the next twelve months if Sundance’s past remains its prologue. But business as usual at Sundance is hardly guaranteed this year, with catastrophic L.A. wildfires still burning, an impending move from the festival’s longtime base in Utah’s Wasatch mountains, and a recent shitstorm of corporate layoffs, depressed media stock prices, and metastasizing unemployment in film projects. In the afterglow of CODA, which won Sundance’s Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award before going on to win Best Picture at the 2022 Academy Awards, Hollywood still looks to Park City as a blast-off pad for future Oscar bait. Toward that end, Jesse Eisenberg’s awards season contender A Real Pain (nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar Thursday morning) and art-house dark horse A Different Man (Best Makeup and Hairstyling), in addition to the Best Feature Documentary nominees Sugarcane, Black Box Diaries, Porcelain War and Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat all got their start at Sundance ‘24. But more generally, Sundance can be understood to provide a kind of bellwether for the health of independent film as both a cinematic genre and business model. “It just gives you this snapshot, almost like a crystal ball,” says Eugene Hernandez, the fest’s director and head of public programming. “You get this moment to peer into the future. These are the films that will be coming later in the year. It is a great moment to take stock of what the year in film has told us, and what do we see coming around the bend?” Despite the industry being significantly diminished by twin Hollywood strikes and pandemic hangover, a cross-section of independent producers hoping to sell films at Sundance tell Vulture they are, nonetheless, bullish on indie filmdom. While the boom times — when platforms like Amazon showed up at the festival with a veritable Brinks truck full of cash to splash out on an entire slate of films — may be firmly in the past, industry machers say there is a wider variety of outlets acquiring independent movies for distribution, both streaming and theatrically, than at any time in recent memory. “If you make a good movie nowadays for a moderate price, I believe there are 10 places that can competitively buy that film,” says Josh Peters, a former director of acquisitions at Focus Features who is a producer on this year’s “coming-of-age drama where the person doesn’t get to come of age” Ricky. “Buyers are being more pragmatic. And I’m noticing a group of financiers who are willing, in the aggregate, to put in a couple hundred thousand here, a couple hundred thousand there. So there’s an ecosystem of buyers telling artists, Take risks. Challenge yourself. Do what’s important to you.” At the Toronto International Film Festival in September, producers Duncan Montgomery and Alex Orlovsky premiered and sold distribution rights for The Last Showgirl to Roadside Attractions, then launched a quick-turnaround theatrical release and awards-qualifying run in December. Now in Park City with the Premieres section thriller Lurker (about a young man who becomes obsessed with an up-and-coming pop star played by Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe), Montgomery contrasts Sundance’s sunny sense of optimism with the kind of mad dash into awards season that a TIFF acquisition deal most often entails. “It feels like there’s a bit of a wind in the sails of indie films,” Montgomery says. “I’m not going to say I know what buyers think. But I’m hopeful that there’s a positive vibe going in. And there’s something about the new year: [Sundance’s] placement in the third week in January. There’s promise. There’s hope. As opposed to those fall festivals where there’s lots of stress.” Several producers point out that disruptions surrounding the 2023 strikes — production shutdowns, release delays, overall starvation of filmic product at the cineplex — contributed to an uptick in the amount of indie fare reaching screens last year. That comes into clearest focus with the awards-y titles that have remained in the cultural conversation through today’s Oscars nominations announcement. Among them: Demi Moore’s body-horror comeback vehicle The Substance, director Gia Coppola’s The Last Showgirl, the controversial Trump biopic The Apprentice, A Different Man (for which star Sebastian Stan won a Golden Globe this month) and the prison-thespian bio-drama Sing Sing. All generated strong buzz at festivals including Toronto, Cannes and Sundance en route to their respective public offerings. That’s part of the calculus behind producers David Siegel and Scott McGehee repeatedly taking their films to the festival since 1994 and aiming to land placement this year for their Gulf War-adjacent crisis-actor comedy Atropia, whose ensemble cast includes Alia Shawcat, Callum Turner, Chloe Sevigny and Channing Tatum. Over that time, the producers have observed Sundance’s imprimatur assuming increasing importance in both marketing and public recognition. “It seems like the audience has really evolved,” McGehee says. “And they are really paying attention to box office now, to film festivals, to reviews. The way audiences engage with the business of the film industry is very different. So these days it seems like audiences care about the lineage that a film has in getting to them. And distributors care about having those things to present to an audience.” While the fest’s renown as North America’s preeminent showcase for indie cinema remains beyond dispute, its pedestal for documentary titles has been complicated by the non-fiction film genre’s declining bankability. Since the N95 era, theatrical turnout for doc features has plummeted in almost inverse proportion to their increasing streaming popularity. But this year, of course, four out of five nominees for the Best Documentary Feature Oscar came from Sundance. And to hear it from Topic Studios’ head of film and documentaries Ryan Heller — who heads to Sundance with the documentaries It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley and the Norwegian “high school movie set at the edge of the earth” Folktales — finding a sweet spot between distributor and material is still achievable. “We’re in a moment where the buyers continue to be very specific and savvy about what works for them,” Heller says. “We’re not in a moment where a buyer is coming in saying, I need five movies. It’s more, If we see something we love, we’ll buy it. But looking at last year’s Sundance, there’s a real case to be made that the right buyer for the right movie is still a perfect match.” Longtime industry pass holder Kevin Iwashina hits Park City this week with the Glenn Kaino-directed short film he produced, Hoops, Hopes & Dreams — it unpacks an unconventional political strategy by Martin Luther King Jr. and an all-star team of ’60s civil rights activists who used pick-up basketball to rally young voters and build networks of empowerment for disenfranchised communities. When I question Iwashina about the health of indie film as a genre, he quickly corrects me: “Indie film is a financial model; it’s not a genre.” From there, the producer takes a brickbat to distinctions between mainstream and independent movies he feels are increasingly irrelevant to Generation Z. “We’re now in a period where there is a range of cinema, a range of quality. Sometimes that quality is going to come in the form of something made outside the system like Anora. And sometimes it’s going to come from within, like The Wild Robot,” Iwashina continues. “A24, as far as any young person is concerned, isn’t indie movies. Those are movies. I think categorically, we just have to redefine and not ghettoize this concept of indie.” “Let’s stop playing identity politics with movies,” he adds. “We know what happened when we did that in the election.”

Title: The Perils of Abusing Leverage

By Adam Sharp Posted January 23, 2025 In 2004, I imploded my first trading account. I was 24 years old and thought I was hot stuff. You see, I had just gotten my stockbroker and financial advisor licenses. I was young, naive, and ready to take on the world. My journey began trading hot stocks like Research in Motion (RIMM). On my second trade, I made $1,400. Wow, this is easy! That win was the worst thing that could have happened. I ramped it up and started using absurd amounts of leverage. Every trade was at least 30% of the account, and occasionally more than 100%. Swing trading, daytrading, momentum, I tried it all. And eventually my trading account balance ticked down to zero. That was my first and only account wipeout. It was a painful – but important – lesson. Fortunately I was young and didn’t have much to lose. I haven’t used margin since. I learned from the experience, and began holding the vast majority of my portfolio in long-term positions. Eventually I learned to use options properly, and those are now the only way I employ leverage. When buying options, potential losses are limited to your initial investment. And the possible upside is just as lucrative as margin. For most of us, however, options should make up a limited portion of our portfolios. Yes, the profit potential is high, but so can be the losses. Keep things balanced. I recently found a painful margin story on Reddit’s infamous WallStreetBets forum. Back in 2018, a user going by the handle “DubiouslyCurious” correctly predicted the rise of NVIDIA (NVDA). He saw that the company was moving beyond video game hardware and into the nascent AI space. So DubiouslyCurious went all-in on NVIDIA with his net worth of approximately £100,000 (British pounds). He used margin to leverage his position up 3x. For a while, everything was going according to plan. NVIDIA shares rose, and his position was in profit. DubiouslyCurious wrote that, “For the first time in my life, I saw a path to financial security.” And then 2020 happened. The COVID pandemic was a classic black swan event, and the crash wiped out his position. The chart below, posted by DubiouslyCurious himself, tells the story. The red line is his leveraged position, and the blue line shows how his investment would have performed without 3x leverage. Source: Yahoo Finance The story was hard to read. I felt that pain. He had correctly assessed NVIDIA’s prospects, but due to his aggressive use of leverage (combined with Dr. Fauci’s aggressive use of gain-of-function research on coronaviruses), he lost it all. “I sold when I had to take out the pittance remaining just to buy food. Ironically, of course, as soon as I sell it jumped back up. But by that point the damage had been done.” If he had simply bought NVIDIA shares without leverage, his position today would be worth over £2 million. Leverage is not something to be played with or taken lightly. With 3x margin, it only takes a 33% correction to wipe out a position. On top of that, you’re paying interest to borrow the funds. Many investors have a story like mine or DubiouslyCurious’. It’s practically an initiation ritual for traders. Most of us take a major loss at some point in our experience. The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes, and incorporate real change into our investing strategies going forward. The earlier an investor learns this lesson, the better. So in the near future I’m going to let my kids trade with $100 each. If the plan works, they’ll lose most of it. And by learning this lesson so early in life, they’ll be ahead of the game once they begin their real investing journey. Then I’ll teach them about the virtues of a long-term, balanced approach.

(Bloomberg) -- Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continue to focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. --With assistance from Georgia Hall.

While Amazon and Walmart may be fierce competitors in the retail world, their commitment to helping those in need during times of crisis proves even corporate rivals can unite in the face of disaster. Both companies have pledged significant financial support to assist victims of the recent wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area, offering critical resources to affected communities, first responders and local organizations. Their collective efforts highlight the power of corporate philanthropy when disaster strikes. Amazon committed $10 million to support relief efforts for communities in the Los Angeles area affected by recent wildfires, many of those communities home to Amazon employees and their families. The donation will go to local and national disaster response organizations, including the American Red Cross, FireAid, MusiCares Fire Relief and World Central Kitchen. Additionally, Amazon donated more than 415,000 essential items to 29 organizations, including fire stations and community groups, and continues to send supplies such as food, water, shelter items and medical equipment. The company is leveraging its AWS cloud technology, including drone support, to assist emergency responders. Meanwhile, Walmart donated $2.5 million to help Los Angeles fire victims. This includes donations of food, water, essential products and grants. The official statement from Walmart reads: “Associates, customers, and members in the communities we serve are experiencing the devastating impacts of the wildfires in Southern California. Our thoughts are with those affected, and we are acting quickly to help. Walmart, Sam’s Club, and the Walmart Foundation are committing $2.5 million to support relief efforts, including donations of food, water, essential products and grants. Over the past several days, Walmart stores in Southern California have donated food, water, and gift cards to help first responders and shelters support people in need. We’re also working with nonprofits and suppliers to bring resources into communities. Throughout the response, we’ll continue looking for ways to support our associates, customers, members, and their families.” Here’s a look at other notable developments from Amazon and Walmart in the past week: We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

To that point, 46% of workers who currently work from home at least sometimes would be somewhat or very unlikely to stay at their job if their employer scrapped remote work, according to a recent poll by Pew Research Center. Yet, employers have reined in remote work. About 75% of workers were required to be in the office a certain number of days per week or month as of October 2024, up from 63% in February 2023, Pew found. "There's a certain creeping up" of return-to-office policies, said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. Companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell Technologies, JPMorgan Chase, UPS and The Washington Post have called at least some employees back to the office five days a week. President Donald Trump signed an executive action on Monday calling federal employees back to their desks "as soon as practicable." Similar to the Pew survey, a poll conducted by Bamboo HR found that 28% of workers would consider quitting due to a return-to-office mandate. The data "underscores how comfortable people have become with this arrangement, and how it really fits in with their lifestyle," Parker said. Workers consistently cite a better work-life balance as a "huge benefit" of remote work, Parker said. Indeed, they see the financial value of hybrid work as being equivalent to an 8% raise, according to research by Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies workplace management. Many economists think that the higher prevalence of remote work, relative to the pre-pandemic era, has become an entrenched feature of the U.S. labor market. "Remote work is not going away," Bloom previously told CNBC. That's largely because it boost profits for companies: Workers quit less often, meaning employers save money on recruiting and other functions tied to attrition, Bloom said. Meanwhile, data shows that productivity doesn't suffer in hybrid work arrangements, he said. More from Personal Finance:How to know if a rental listing is a scamNow is an 'ideal time' to reassess your retirement savingsHow climate change is reshaping home insurance costs More than 60% of paid, full workdays were done remotely in early 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic — up from less than 10% before the pandemic, according to WFH Research, a project run jointly by researchers from MIT, Stanford, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. That share has fallen by more than half. However, it has leveled out between 25% and 30% for about two years, according to WFH Research data. About 31% of employers reduced remote work opportunities in 2024, down from 43% in 2023, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. Yet, another 33% expanded remote work, up from 32% the prior year. Companies that imposed RTO mandates have annual rates of employee turnover that are 13% higher than those that have become "more supportive" of remote work, ZipRecruiter said. "The ability to work from anywhere remains a top priority for many professionals," according to a 2024 poll by consulting firm Korn Ferry of 10,000 workers in the U.S., U.K., Brazil, Middle East, Australia and India. Some businesses force workers back to the office precisely because they want workers to quit, experts said. It's a stealthy way of reducing headcount without having explicit layoffs, they said. "Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead a new advisory board dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, wrote in a November op-ed. On Monday, Ramaswamy told CNBC he was leaving DOGE to run for governor of Ohio. Of course, there are also trade-offs to remote work for businesses and workers. About 59% of employers cite concerns that remote work harms company culture, according to ZipRecruiter. About half of workers — 53% — who work from home at least part time say it "hurts" their ability to feel connected with co-workers, Pew found in a 2023 poll. "It's the one big downside we've seen consistently," Parker said. "That seems to be a tradeoff: You get the work-life balance but lose some connectivity with coworkers," Parker said. Even if workers quit, they may not be able to find a job. The labor market remains strong, with low unemployment and low levels of layoffs, meaning workers have good job security, according to economists. However, companies have also pulled back on hiring, making it a challenging environment for job seekers. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Is Quantum Computing Investable As The Next AI ?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/vineerbhansali/2025/01/23/is-quantum-computing-investable-as-the-next-ai-/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T20:48:33Z
Full Content:
quantum computer The boom and bust and re-boom in quantum computing stocks over the last few weeks (look for example at the price gain and collapse and re-gain of RGTI, QBTS, QUBT, IONQ and others) has drawn comments from analysts that, on the one hand, equate quantum computing with a “bubble,” and on the other hand compare it with the early days of AI. Questions include: How far can quantum computing go? Can it challenge classical computing in the near future? Are quantum computing stocks worth investing in? Is one of these companies, or maybe one that is not even a company yet, but just in the heads of physicists somewhere in one of the tech universities around the world, the next big thing? Is this a lot of hocus pocus or a computational paradigm that might blow current capabilities out of the water and make NVDA look like, well, Intel of prior years? Investing in quantum computing is additionally scary today because the price of quantum computing stocks is being driven by both speculative instinct and the opinions of some of the rock stars of the AI revolution, who, if I may say so, probably do not know much more than the rest of us when it comes to forecasting the potential power and timing of when the strategy may become practical. One might be forgiven for thinking that comments regarding the near-term viability of quantum computing by Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg from a few weeks ago are somewhat self-serving, looking to protect their turf from a potential new game-changing technology, though in fairness they are also quite involved in pushing the frontiers of quantum computing technology. For sure, if Nvidia has ushered in exponential growth in computational power behind AI, then the potential of quantum computing, which can provide a “double exponential” speedup in computation (this is known as Neven’s law), will make classical computing based on even the fastest NVDA GPUs look linear. And there are good reasons why NVDA cannot just come out and say quantum is the next big thing, because doing so would likely decimate the market for their current chips and the profitability that has propelled it to be the most valuable company in the world (as of the date of this writing). In the world of computing, linear speedup, even relatively speaking, is considered an insult, because quantum computing theoretically has the potential of not just exponential, but a “double exponential” speedup. So, the simple answer to whether practical quantum computing is on the horizon in the near future is that no one really knows. It is similar to the task of predicting the probability that a meteor will hit the earth over the next decade. We simply don’t know. But that should not prevent us from being somewhat prepared. To me, the real question is not whether practical quantum computing will happen in the next few years, but what are the consequences if it does, and how, as an investor can I rationally position myself for the rare but impactful consequences. The physical laws behind quantum computing are on solid ground, unlike many other fads like negative interest rates that were implemented in Germany, or perpetual motion machines of eras past. First, let us put some confusion to rest. There is already a “practical” quantum computer in operation today. As a matter of fact, it has been in operation for as long as our physical world has existed. Yes, current physics says that nature is a massive quantum computer. I did my Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, in the area of Quantum Field Theory, which strangely enough, works amazingly well in explaining the real world. The fact that nature seems to obey the rules of quantum mechanics all the way down to elementary particles and beyond is now beyond doubt. I also had the distinct pleasure of being at Caltech around the time that Nobel laureate Richard Feynman started to seriously think about quantum computers and around when he uttered the famous quote that “Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical”. In other words, even the fastest NVDA chips only get you a classical approximation to the real thing when it comes to simulation. It is akin to trying to simulate the nature of sub-atomic particles by applying Newton’s laws to smaller and faster bouncing balls. At some point the classical simulation will just fail because bouncing balls will never be able to replicate the peculiar quantum mechanical laws obeyed by sub-atomic particles. There are indeed problems today, though somewhat academic, that are practically impossible for classical computers to solve. As far as practicality goes, let’s not forget that the period between when proclamations were made that humans could not fly to when airplanes showed it could be done was quite short. What it took was a change of mindset and the development of a parallel framework - humans fly in planes by understanding the basic principles of aerodynamics, not by flapping their wings like birds. The quantum approach to computing will also develop parallel ways of solving the problems of computation, and they cannot be extrapolated from classical ways of computing. Its a new paradigm, and new paradigms can quickly shatter the constraints of old paradigms. After close to three decades of research, quantum computers have been built that can theoretically solve problems that cannot be solved on a classical computer (see the discussion of “quantum supremacy,” and a more sober look in light of recent claims by the Google team here by one of my other professors from Caltech, the theoretical physicist John Preskill), and the question now is not whether quantum computers that can exceed current classical computing is possible, but how hard really the current problems like error correction are. Impossible is bad, hard is good! The history of human innovation is that when the possibility of a game-changing technology exists, the speed at which hard problems become easier to solve is much faster than linear thinking allows us to imagine. When the rate at which the innovation — i.e. quantum computing’s rate of growth — is doubly exponential, not just exponential, the possibility of missing the inflection point is very real. And much of the acceleration in such situations also comes from incumbents who are competing amongst themselves for the next big thing. No wonder that after tanking quantum computing stocks, NVDA announced a” Quantum Day” at its GTC conference on March 20 (here). To me, it seems that the commercial race is already on, though it might be beneficial to do the development in stealth mode for most so they don’t get crushed out of their path to progress. This brings me to investability. Stock market investing is always risky, and speculative stock-market investing, as in quantum computing stocks (or AI, turn-of-the-century dot-coms or Bitcoin not too long ago), is doubly risky. But the upside compensation for taking the risk can also be large, which might justify a thoughtful, carefully considered, small allocation, to moonshot investments. The precise modeling of potential gains and losses for such speculative investments is basically impossible. At the simplest level, one can simply think of investing in such stocks as a biased coin flip experiment, where the odds of the coin flip coming up heads — i.e. a “win” is some number you make up — and the odds of the stock going belly up (i.e. price falling to zero), is one minus that number. An unbiased coin would have a probability of coming up heads or coming up tails to be equal or 50%. What makes things even more tricky is that these odds are dynamic and ever-changing, and can be subject to the opinions of experts who also know very little about the future but still have influence on pricing. Which means that proper sizing, or allocation of capital, is one of the only ways to ensure that one can stay the course, “HODL,” and not be shaken out. The mathematics of biased coin-flip betting is well known. As a matter of fact, it forms the foundation of all option pricing. For our purposes here let us imagine that the coin we are tossing has a very low probability of coming up heads. If this probability is labelled p, then the expected value, or average return over many such bets, assuming equal payoffs in the win and the loss states, is simply equal to p. So if the probability of success is 10% on one trial, then over many independent trials, the expected payoff can be estimated by multiplying 10% by the payoff if there is success. The lower the probability of success, the lower the expected value. Just like lottery tickets which have a very low probability of success, the expected value of speculative stock investing is very low. But that’s not the end of the story. As one would expect, both lottery tickets and speculative stocks have massive “skewness” and “kurtosis” when the probability of success is low, despite having very low expected value. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of payoffs, and kurtosis is a measure of how “fat” the tail is. For a coin toss with probability of success p, the skewness and kurtosis both go to infinity when the probability of success is very low. This should not be a shocking result — we all know how low probability investments, e.g. bitcoin, can deliver massive returns (just recall bitcoin’s experience over the last few years). While it is easy to pooh pooh those dumb souls who bet on fat right tails, or lottery ticket-like investments, the fact of the matter is that such investments can make life-changing impact for investors, if they are made at a time when the price is not already discounting the massive positive returns. For a stock bought cheaply enough, this upside potential can counter the low expected return. Also note that both the skewness and kurtosis for a coin toss is minimum when the risks are balanced; i.e. the probability of success and failure are equal to 50% each. The danger of investing in such speculative investments arises from taking on too much exposure. This is because a low probability of success effectively guarantees that on average, returns will be low or negative. So, the bet one is making really is that by investing at the right price, the potential of outsized gains on the winners makes up for the almost certain losses on the losers. Again, as most readers undoubtedly know or have read, the optimal exposure that maximizes the long term growth rate of simple binary investments is given by the almost too simple (and magical) Kelly criterion (see here) which says that the optimal fraction to invest is simply p-(1-p)/b, where b are the odds upon success. For example, if one bets a dollar and upon a win is returned three dollars, and upon a loss loses the one dollar he bet, then b=2. So, we can see that if the probability of success is very low, then the payoff has to be very high for a profitable bet to be possible. If the payoff is not high enough then the optimal allocation must be very small. Let us calibrate this to investing in quantum computing. If we believe that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computation, then it is not hard to imagine a 100 to 1 payoff though it could take years for this to happen. So, if the probability of success is 5% , then the “optimal” fraction to bet at this enormous potential payout is about 4% of the portfolio. In this example, the investor should bet nothing if the potential payoff is less than about 19 times (obtained by dividing the probability of failure which is 95% by the probability of success which is 5%). In its current state, no one knows which type of quantum computing technology and which company will succeed. So, it also behooves the investor to divvy up the total allocation amongst many different technologies. Clearly, I take the view that quantum computing is very risky but investable, regardless of what the talking heads say, as long as there is potential for massive upside, the entry price is right, and as long as the exposure is kept small enough to not create a situation where the investor is forced out at the wrong time. The gut wrenching 50% decline in one day on an off-the-cuff comment by Jensen Huang last week illustrates that those who had positions too large or leveraged probably got forced out at the wrong price, creating the buying opportunity for those who were able to step in at the right size. At the end of the day, sizing exposures is probably as important, if not more important than getting the direction of investments right for any investment. In the case of highly speculative moonshots like quantum computing stocks, sizing things right — i.e. big enough but not too big —and owning the upside, skewness and the kurtosis, is probably the approach that balances out the risks with the potential of outsized returns. Just as there are catastrophic “left tails” which can destroy value, there are also “right tails”, which, if not managed for, can create massive missed opportunities. Like they say — you have to be “in it to win it.” Just be careful how much you risk. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Is Quantum Computing Investable As The Next AI ?

quantum computer The boom and bust and re-boom in quantum computing stocks over the last few weeks (look for example at the price gain and collapse and re-gain of RGTI, QBTS, QUBT, IONQ and others) has drawn comments from analysts that, on the one hand, equate quantum computing with a “bubble,” and on the other hand compare it with the early days of AI. Questions include: How far can quantum computing go? Can it challenge classical computing in the near future? Are quantum computing stocks worth investing in? Is one of these companies, or maybe one that is not even a company yet, but just in the heads of physicists somewhere in one of the tech universities around the world, the next big thing? Is this a lot of hocus pocus or a computational paradigm that might blow current capabilities out of the water and make NVDA look like, well, Intel of prior years? Investing in quantum computing is additionally scary today because the price of quantum computing stocks is being driven by both speculative instinct and the opinions of some of the rock stars of the AI revolution, who, if I may say so, probably do not know much more than the rest of us when it comes to forecasting the potential power and timing of when the strategy may become practical. One might be forgiven for thinking that comments regarding the near-term viability of quantum computing by Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg from a few weeks ago are somewhat self-serving, looking to protect their turf from a potential new game-changing technology, though in fairness they are also quite involved in pushing the frontiers of quantum computing technology. For sure, if Nvidia has ushered in exponential growth in computational power behind AI, then the potential of quantum computing, which can provide a “double exponential” speedup in computation (this is known as Neven’s law), will make classical computing based on even the fastest NVDA GPUs look linear.

Title: Larry Fink says Bitcoin is going all the way to $700,000
URL: https://qz.com/bitcoin-price-forecast-larry-fink-blackrock-davos-2025-1851746542

This story incorporates reporting from Inside Bitcoins and Inside Bitcoins. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing volatility as major coins see substantial price movements. Bitcoin, having recently dipped more than 3% to $102,661.93, has secured attention at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink offered a bold prediction of Bitcoin reaching a remarkable $700,000. Fink points to small allocations by asset managers, alongside Bitcoin’s potential to counter fiat currency debasement, as key drivers behind this projection. During his discussion with Bloomberg on January 22, Fink outlined how a mere 2-5% allocation to Bitcoin from asset managers globally could propel its price to the target figure. He contends that investors concerned about the potential weakening of their domestic fiat currencies, or who have concerns about their country’s political and economic stability, can turn to Bitcoin as a reliable hedge against such risks. According to Fink, Bitcoin’s global nature enables it to act as a “secure international currency” to mitigate local uncertainties. In a contrasting viewpoint, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, talking to CNBC, emphasized that Bitcoin does not pose a threat to the U.S. dollar, yet acknowledged its significance as an “interesting speculative asset.” Solomon affirmed his belief in the dollar’s dominance but expressed keen interest in the technology underpinning Bitcoin. He hinted that blockchain could eventually reduce operational friction within the broader financial system, although regulatory and operational restrictions currently limit banks’ direct involvement with Bitcoin. These remarks occurred amid a broader, albeit mild, pullback in Bitcoin’s price. Analysts observed the trend with Bitcoin slipping approximately 2% further, trading at $102,628, accompanied by a noticeable decrease in trading volume — down 20% to $61 billion. The fluctuation highlights the current unstable nature of the crypto market, posing both opportunities and pitfalls for investors. Fink’s optimistic outlook contrasts notably with the general market sentiment characterized by recent price declines. His insights present a longer-term bullish narrative amidst current short-term price corrections. Whether Bitcoin’s price will approach his ambitious forecast may depend on broader adoption trends and how effectively the asset addresses investors’ demands for stability and inflation protection. As global economic conditions evolve, these factors will play pivotal roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80 Third Point’s Stake: $190.1 million CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is an international group of diversified building materials businesses whose headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. The following elements demonstrate why this company is an excellent investment choice. Firstly, as per the report for the third quarter of 2024, the total revenues were 7% ahead of the third quarter of the prior year, benefitting from the acquisition of Adbri in July 2024 and partly offset by the divestiture of the European Lime operations. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA was 24% ahead of the prior year, driven by good commercial management, lower energy costs, operational efficiencies and contributions from acquisitions, which are positive indicators for investors looking for operational strength. Moreover, CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) has completed 12 acquisitions for a total consideration of $1.4 billion, compared with $0.4 billion in the same period of 2023. Americas Materials Solutions completed seven acquisitions, Americas Building Solutions completed three acquisitions, and Europe Materials Solutions completed two acquisitions. This could lead to enhanced revenue streams, improved market share, and long-term value creation. Overall, CRH ranks 14th on our list of Billionaire Dan Loeb’s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of CRH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than CRH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Amazon reportedly resumes green-card applications under Trump

Amazon (AMZN) has reportedly restarted the application process for foreign workers to obtain green cards, Business Insider first reported, citing an internal memo from last year. The company resumed processing on Jan. 6, after a two-year pause in which the company suspended new PERM filings. While Amazon hasn’t provided a specific reason for resuming the program, it’s likely part of its plan to prepare for a more competitive labor market. The PERM, or Program Electronic Review Management process, impacts foreign workers who are seeking green cards. It requires companies to prove that hiring foreign employees won’t harm job opportunities or wages for U.S. workers. The process is both time-consuming – taking between 2 to 3 years – and expensive, with costs ranging from $2,500 to $20,000. Amazon’s decision to restart the PERM process comes as it scales back its operations in Canada. Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of seven warehouses in Quebec, alongside layoffs that impact nearly 2,000 workers. Amazon has eliminated more 27,000 roles across different departments from late 2022 onward. Earlier this month, it also laid off 200 employees from its Fashion and Fitness division. Despite these cuts, the resumption of green-card filings suggests Amazon may be seeking global talent to meet its future growth goals. The move appears to align with President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to offer green cards to all foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges, which could further expand Amazon’s potential talent pool. The tech giant is the second largest U.S. employer, behind Walmart (WMT). This potential shif coincides with Amazon’s push for employees to return to the office. The company has warned that failure to comply with its return-to-office (RTO) policy could lead to termination. However, Amazon is having a tough time meeting office-space requirements for its sprawling workforce. Initially, Amazon planned for all employees to return to the office five days a week starting Jan. 2, 2025, but some locations are not yet prepared to accommodate the full staff.

Title: Who’s in the Cabinet? All the Ministers appointed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and their roles
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2025/01/23/whos-in-the-cabinet-all-the-ministers-appointed-by-taoiseach-micheal-martin-and-their-roles/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T19:33:06Z
Full Content:
The new Government finally comes into power a day later than planned and just under two months after the general election on November 29th last. Here is the new line-up: Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin’s return to the role of Taoiseach got off to a turbulent start after an unprecedented 24-hour delay, following chaotic Dáil scenes over speaking rights for Independents supporting the Government. But with the row over for now, the 64-year-old starts his new administration in full command of his party with a secure majority and confident of a full term for this administration, allowing for more rows and possible resignations along the way. [ The Irish Times view on the chaos at Leinster House: a shambolic day in the DáilOpens in new window ] A normally shrewd, savvy and ruthless operator when necessary, he is a great political survivor who has rebuilt the party after its disastrous 2011 election when it lost 57 seats. He is the longest-serving Fianna Fáil leader after Éamon de Valera. Most political colleagues, even some of his fiercest critics, will always describe him as a “decent man”. Vastly experienced, he has served not just as taoiseach and tánaiste, but also as a minister for education, enterprise and employment and health, and until now as minister for foreign affairs and defence. A member of Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995, he was first elected to the Dáil in 1989, before which he worked as a secondary schoolteacher. Ireland’s youngest taoiseach when he secured the job in March 2024 at the age of 37, Simon Harris moves to Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. With a lot of travel, this could be tricky for a party leader with ambitious backbenchers. But with 22 of the 38 Fine Gael TDs new to the Dáil, and a prospective reshuffle when he rotates again to taoiseach, this should not be a problem. His new team will look to him as something of an elder statesman after 15 years in politics and an astoundingly rapid rise through the ranks. A councillor at 22, a TD at 24 in 2011 and minister for health at the age of 29, he ran his local election campaign almost entirely on social media, winning the highest vote in the State. The 2020 election was called before a vote of no confidence in him as minister for health could be taken. But his performance and communication skills during the ensuing Covid pandemic rehabilitated and burnished his image and his high profile eventually led to his moniker as the “TikTok taoiseach”. His popularity ratings and those of his party took a hit with a series of mishaps in the election. Still, with 10 seats fewer than Fianna Fáil, he has done well to retain seven Cabinet seats and will have 26 months as taoiseach. Paschal Donohoe (50) starts his third term as Minister for Finance, following his second stint at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, a further signal of the Government’s “stability” message. Fine Gael TD for Dublin Central since 2011, he is now the party’s longest-serving Cabinet member and its most influential. An assured political and media performer, he is a skilled exponent of the “whatever you say, say nothing” philosophy. Currently president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, a position he is expected to retain, he previously served as minister for transport, tourism and sport, and minister of State for European affairs. First elected to Dublin City Council in 2004, he served a term in the Seanad from 2007 following an unsuccessful general election bid for the Dáil. In the last Dáil term he admitted to a breach in electoral rules by receiving a corporate donation in 2020 above the legal limit. Affable and well-read, he writes book reviews for The Irish Times and other publications. A Trinity graduate, he previously worked as a sales manager for a multinational company. [ Does Paschal Donohoe haggle? ‘I get enough of that at budget time so I leave shopkeepers in peace’Opens in new window ] The State’s youngest minister for finance when he was appointed in June last year, Jack Chambers (34) previously served as a minister of state in the department with responsibility for financial services. He has been a TD since 2016 when he was elected as the youngest member of the Dáil in that election, having previously been a councillor and serving as mayor of Fingal. Educated at the private Dublin boys’ school Belvedere College, Chambers has a degree in law and politics from Trinity College and graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland in 2020, completing his final medical exams while a TD. He is from Castleknock in his Dublin West constituency and has had a rapid rise through the political ranks. A protege of Micheál Martin, who appointed him as Fianna Fáil deputy leader, he is perceived as a steady hand. Generally low-key, he has shown his combative side in media interviews and Dáil rows. He has also served as minister of State for sport, the Gaeltacht and defence, and minister of State in the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment. Viewed as “solid”, “capable” and “steady”, Peter Burke (42) has, as expected, retained the Cabinet portfolio Harris first appointed him to, at a time when challenges for Ireland have intensified following the inauguration of US president Donald Trump. At the outset of the Fine Gael general election campaign, he provoked controversy when Michael O’Leary launched the Longford-Westmeath TD’s own campaign and said there were “too many” teachers in the Dáil. The married father of two grew up on a farm near Mullingar and is a horseracing fan. Popular within Fine Gael, Burke was first elected to the Dáil in 2016, after serving since 2009 as a Westmeath councillor and on Mullingar Town Council. Before his Cabinet appointment he served as minister of State for housing with responsibility for local government and planning and as a minister of State for European affairs. He graduated with a degree in commerce from NUI Galway in 2004, and worked as a chartered accountant for 10 years. After huge speculation, Jim O’Callaghan has been confirmed as Minister for Justice in a newly expanded department that will include immigration. This is an issue he has been concerned with because of the tent city that grew around the IPAS (International Protection Accommodation Services) offices in Dublin city centre, part of his Dublin Bay South constituency. The 56-year-old had made no secret of his ambition for the role but because of a difficult relationship with the leadership, doubt was cast on his chances. In 2020 he turned down the role of junior minister in the department, opting to remain on the backbenches. A barrister and senior counsel, he is the party’s spokesman on justice and was Fianna Fáil’s legal adviser before his first election to the Dáil in 2016. Well regarded by his colleagues, he is a strong and incisive contributor to Dáil justice debates. A brother of broadcaster and presenter Miriam O’Callaghan, he lives in Ranelagh and played rugby to a high level, representing UCD, Cambridge University, London Irish, Wanderers, Leinster and Connacht at senior level. He also represented Ireland at under-21 level. He holds degrees in law from UCD, Cambridge University and the King’s Inns. When Helen McEntee (38) won a Dáil seat in the 2013 byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee, it was the first Fine Gael byelection victory while in government since 1977. From Castletown, Co Meath, she is a DCU graduate and worked in financial services before becoming personal assistant to her father. She served as minister of State for mental health and older people for a year and then as minister of State for European affairs when Leo Varadkar was taoiseach. Appointed minister for justice in 2020, she focused on violence against women and implemented innovative anti-coercive control legislation. She also became the first Cabinet member to take maternity leave while in office in 2021 and again for the birth of her second child. Challenges in justice including migration, crime and public safety sparked sharp criticism, particularly following the riots in the capital in November 2023 which resulted in a Dáil vote of no confidence that she survived. She topped the Meath East poll in the 2024 general election. [ Helen McEntee: The next Fine Gael leader in waiting?Opens in new window ] [ Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien interview: ‘Fair-minded’ people will see housing progress by electionOpens in new window ] Darragh O’Brien (50) is moving from housing to the Departments of Transport and Environment and Climate Change. He is moving from one crisis – in housing – to another in the environment. There will also be much speculation as to whether he will be the Minister who finally gets the Dublin MetroLink under way. From Malahide, Co Dublin, he has been involved in politics for 20 years, starting as a councillor on Fingal County Council in 2004 before his election to the Dáil in 2007. He worked in the financial services sector dealing with pensions as an area manager for Friends First Assurance Company, before entering full-time politics. After losing his Dáil seat in the 2007 election, he successfully ran for the Seanad on the Labour panel before his re-election to the Dáil in 2016, when he topped the poll, building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. Ebullient and a political scrapper, he frequently came to verbal blows with his staunchest critic, Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin. Fianna Fáil will hope Norma Foley’s retention in Cabinet can solidify their standing in Kerry against the high-profile and effective Independent Healy-Rae brothers. During the election she came in for some criticism over conditions in the courthouse in Tralee. The 54-year-old TD grew up in politics following her father Denis Foley, winning a seat on her third attempt in 2020. A secondary schoolteacher, she was appointed to Cabinet in her first Dáil term, during the Covid pandemic. The Junior Certificate exams were abandoned and there were errors in the coding of the Leaving Certificate calculated grades system, for which she was forced to apologise. The pandemic resulted in grade inflation in State exams, the final reset of which is expected this year. She leaves the department as the challenges of AI facing education intensify. A low-key but assured performer, she held her cool and staunchly defended her initiative in the budget controversy over the €9 million phone pouches spend, which was ridiculed by the opposition and divided some in the teaching profession. Patrick O’Donovan (47) moves from Further and Higher Education to which he was appointed in June last year to a more high-profile job where his often blunt speaking has provoked strong reactions. The Limerick county TD was first elected to the Dáil in 2011, having previously served as a county councillor. He trained as a schoolteacher and also worked as an industrial chemist. In June 2023 he collapsed while taking questions in the Dáil and was rushed to hospital but recovered well. With a reputation as a political street fighter, he was frequently sent out to bat for Fine Gael on controversial issues before his appointment as a minister of state. He served from 2016 as minister of state for sport and in 2017 was appointed as a junior minister in finance and public expenditure. He also served as minister of State for the OPW, but had moved to the higher education portfolio when the controversy over the cost of the Leinster House bike shelter erupted. Qualified as both a solicitor and a barrister, Jennifer Carroll MacNeill (44) also has a PhD in public policy. A strong media performer, she has frequently clashed with Sinn Féin in the Dáil and on the airwaves. She is understood to have had a keen interest in the challenging health portfolio and will need all her qualifications and skills as she is expected to face significant challenges from day one in the job. She joined Fine Gael as legal adviser when Enda Kenny was opposition leader and was elected to Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council in 2019 before her election to the Dáil in 2020. A prominent first-time Fine Gael TD, she was appointed minister of state for finance in 2022 before moving to the role of minister of state for European affairs and for defence. During the 2020 election campaign she was harassed by a man who sent her sexually explicit videos and who was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to the offence, receiving a one-year suspended jail sentence. She has a son with former Ireland rugby international Hugo MacNeill. Martin Heydon (46) starts his fourth Dáil term with a promotion to full Cabinet role in the agriculture portfolio, where he has some experience. His appointment makes him the first senior Minister in Kildare since Charllie McCreevy in 2004. A member of Fine Gael’s government formation negotiations team, he is popular with and highly regarded by his party colleagues and the wider Dáil community. He has a level-headed approach to politics and rarely loses his cool in Dáil rows or arguments over the airwaves. From a farming background, he is a graduate of Kildalton Agricultural College and served as minister of state in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the last government. He joined Fine Gael in 2008 and was elected to Kildare County Council in 2009 before his 2011 election to the Dáil. From 2016 to 2020, he was chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party. The father of four is married to former Kildare Gaelic footballer Brianne Leahy, a two-time All Star winner, and they live outside Kilcullen village. James Browne’s involvement in the government formation talks for Fianna Fáil and his successful stewardship of the long-awaited Gambling Bill through the Dáil and Seanad undoubtedly contributed to his elevation to the senior ranks of Government. A serious, no drama politician from Enniscorthy he studied hotel management and worked for a number of years in various roles in bars and hotels. Returning to study law, he qualified as a barrister in 2006. He served as a Wexford county councillor from 2014 until 2016 when he was first elected to the Dáil and at the following two general elections. Fianna Fáil spokesman on mental health, he introduced initiatives to reform mental health services in Ireland. A minister of state in 2020 in the Department of Justice, he had responsibility for law reform and youth justice. The 49-year-old also served on the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare. He is the son of former TD and minister of state John Browne and his great uncle Seán Browne, was also a TD for Wexford, first elected in 1957. Mayo Fianna Fáil TD Dara Calleary (51) gets a second chance as a senior Minister in Government with his appointment to the money-spending departments of Social Protection and Community and Rural Affairs. Following the 2020 general election there was shock that he had been snubbed for a senior portfolio and was instead offered the role of chief whip. Shortly afterwards he was appointed minister for agriculture following the sacking of Barry Cowen from the role. But controversy erupted when he attended a parliamentary golf club dinner in Clifden in breach of Covid regulations and he stood down the day after the issue became public, only weeks after his appointment. He was appointed minister of state for trade promotion, digital transformation and company regulation last year. From 2009 to 2011 he was minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation. Viewed as capable and calm and well like by his colleagues, he comes from a family of politicians, following his father Sean and grandfather Phelim into the Dáil. The Kildare North TD James Lawless joins the Cabinet at the start of his third term as a TD. He was appointed a minister of state last year to the Department of Transport, and was involved in dealing with the aftermath of Storm Darragh and the chaos following the resultant closure of the Holyhead port. Prior to his first election to the Dáil in 2016, he was a member of Kildare County Council for two years from 2014. He served as mayor of Naas during that period. Before becoming an elected representative, he was an activist campaigner on numerous commuter issues. A barrister by profession having attended King’s Inn, he also worked for VHI Healthcare insurance. He has degrees in maths and computer science from Trinity College Dublin. Originally from Wexford, he lives in Sallins with his wife Ailish, a primary schoolteacher. They have two daughters. Rossa Fanning SC (48) stays on as Attorney General, the Government’s legal adviser, following his initial appointment in 2022. He has advised on a number of controversial areas including the failed referendums on carers and the family. In unpublished advice which later became public, he said there was legal uncertainty over the proposed word “strive” would be more forceful than “endeavour”, currently in the Constitution. He also advised that it would have “real effects” that could be enforced by the courts. A graduate of Blackrock College in Dubin and UCD where he was auditor of the Law Society, he was a Fulbright scholar and came first in his class at the King’s Inns. A specialist in commercial law, his expertise in insolvency cases and business disputes made him a key player in many prominent post-Celtic Tiger era cases. He became a senior counsel in 2016. He was involved in high-profile cases involving some of the biggest names in corporate Ireland including Denis O’Brien, Larry Goodman, Dermot Desmond and Michael Smurfit and large multinationals such as Google and Facebook, along with financial institutions, investment funds and media companies. Galway West TD Hildegarde Naughton and former government chief whip did not secure a senior Government portfolio but retains her seat at Cabinet as a Super Junior Minister covering Disability. Her reappointment means County Galway will have three Super Juniors with Independents also at Cabinet. The former primary schoolteacher was elected to Galway City Council in 2009 and became mayor in 2011. After an unsuccessful Dáil bid she was nominated to the Seanad in 2013 and in 2016 won a Dáil seat, elected again in 2020 and in 2024. In 2020 she was appointed as a super junior minister of state in the departments of climate change and transport, with responsibility for aviation and subsequently to health, where she had responsibility for drugs strategy. Last year she was appointed government chief whip by Simon Harris when he took over as taoiseach. An accomplished singer, she is a classically trained soprano singing with Bel Canto, a group she cofounded. She has also won awards for her performances in musical theatre. After 22 years in the Dáil, Noel Grealish will sit at the Cabinet table as a Super Junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture. The Galway West TD (58) has been a TD since 2002 when he was elected as a member of the Progressive Democrats and again in 2007 for that party, taking on the leadership role when then leader Ciarán Cannon decided to join Fine Gael. He stayed on as leader until 2009 when the party finally disbanded. He has successfully held his seat as an Independent and his younger brother Tómas joined the Carnmore-based TD in politics when he was elected to Galway County Council. The former owner of a glass company, he landed himself in hot water over comments about asylum seekers in Oughterard, but he has strong and loyal support and is viewed locally as having a very strong constituency work ethic. Former minister of State for the OPW and flood relief, Seán Canney, now takes on a Super Junior ministerial role in the Department of Transport. He has advocated for the reopening of the Western Rail Corridor to trains from Galway to Claremorris. The 64-year-old from Tuam, Co Galway comes from a farming family is a quantity surveyor by profession and worked in the private sector for 25 years. Before his election in 2016 to the Dáil, he was a lecturer in construction economics and quantity surveying. Mr Canney said he had requested the restoration of the controversial travel and subsistence allowance, worth about €32,000 annually, to ministers of state. He said non-payment of the allowance penalised office holders. “If you were going into a ministerial office over the past 10 years you ended up with less of an amount of money to do more.” He served previously as a minister of State from 2016 to 2017 and again from 2018 to 2020 as a member of the Independent Alliance. A county councillor from 2004 to 2015 including a year as mayor of Galway, he has also served on a number of boards and committees. Waterford TD Mary Butler (58) becomes the Government’s Chief Whip. From Portlaw, she ran a family grocery business for 17 years in the town. She served as a local councillor from 2014 until her first election to the Dáil in 2016. When in opposition she was junior spokeswoman for older people and chair of an Oireachtas cross-party group on dementia. She opposed the legalisation of abortion in the 2018 referendum. In the same year she introduced a private member’s Bill to ban tattoos and intimate piercings for people under the age of 18. As minister for older people she introduced a range of legislation including safeguarding measures and expressed concern that families might be incentivised to put elderly relatives into care when minister for housing Darragh O’Brien proposed to allow tax-free rental of the homes of relatives in nursing homes. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

We came across a bullish thesis on The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE) on Twitter by EagleFangCapital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on PLCE. The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE)'s share was trading at $10.17 as of Jan 22nd. PLCE’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.61 and 8.54 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A young boy happily shopping in a children's apparel retail store. In its most recent quarter, PLCE reported $455 million in sales, a 3.4% increase quarter-to-date driven by strong wholesale performance, and is projected to end the quarter flattish with sales between $450-460 million. Gross margin is expected to improve significantly, with an anticipated 30% GM, a sharp recovery from last year's 21.7% disaster, as the company has been running closer to 35% throughout the year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SGA) are forecasted at $100 million, similar to Q3 levels, translating to EBITDA of $35-38 million, compared to $44.5 million in Q3 and $23 million in the seasonally weaker Q2. While the calendar shift affected Q3, there could be lower sales but higher gross margin in Q4, bringing EBITDA close to the Q3 figures. With $100 million+ of EBITDA over the first nine months and an improved Q4, a baseline of $125-130 million for the year seems achievable. The company's capital expenditure is expected to be around $25 million, and with interest expense starting to decrease, a path toward generating real free cash flow and reducing debt begins to take shape in the coming year. Even if free cash flow per share comes in at $3 instead of $5 due to the rights offering, the current $10 share price appears significantly undervalued, making it an attractive opportunity moving forward. The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 9 hedge fund portfolios held PLCE at the end of the third quarter which was 13 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of PLCE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR) on Long-Term Pick’s Substack by Dan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MPWR. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR)'s share was trading at $689.42 as of Jan 22nd. MPWR’s trailing and forward P/E were 77.72 and 39.68 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. An automated manufacturing production line of semiconductor components on an assembly line. Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) is a leading semiconductor company specializing in power-efficient solutions across a wide range of industries, including data centers, automotive, industrial automation, and consumer electronics. Founded in 1997, the company is known for its innovative analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, which are essential for technological transitions in key sectors such as electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure, and AI-powered data centers. With a strong focus on design and innovation, MPS operates as a fabless company, outsourcing its manufacturing while maintaining high flexibility and reducing fixed costs. This business model allows MPS to leverage its proprietary process technologies to enhance efficiency and deliver high returns on invested capital (ROIC). MPS is strategically positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in high-tech sectors, with the automotive and data center markets being primary drivers of its long-term growth. The automotive segment is experiencing an expansion due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and advanced driver-assist systems, while the data center segment is benefiting from the rising demand for AI workloads and cloud computing technologies. These sectors are expected to fuel MPS's growth, with the company projected to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 20% through 2030. MPS is expected to see its earnings per share (EPS) grow at a rate of 20.6% annually, with sales projected to increase by 18.8% through fiscal 2026. Despite its strong growth potential, MPS recently faced challenges, including a loss of market share related to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU platform. Performance issues with its voltage regulator modules (VRMs) led to reduced allocations and canceled orders, causing the stock to drop nearly 20%. However, the company’s leadership remains confident in the future of MPS, particularly in the AI-driven server market, which is expected to stabilize and grow in the coming years. MPS's competitive edge is anchored in its proprietary BCD technology, which integrates analog, digital, and memory components into a single chip, delivering higher power density and greater efficiency than competitors. The company’s fabless model further enhances its cost structure, making it a key player in its industry. MPS's diverse customer base includes major companies in computing, automotive, and cloud computing, reinforcing its integral role in global supply chains. MPS is well-positioned for continued growth with a strong balance sheet, including $1.46 billion in cash and no debt. However, risks remain, including potential geopolitical concerns and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Despite these risks, MPS is widely viewed as undervalued, with a discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of the stock to be $715.78, suggesting a 12.6% upside. This makes MPS an attractive investment for those seeking exposure to high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles and AI-driven data centers. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 38 hedge fund portfolios held MPWR at the end of the third quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of MPWR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Dogecoin ETFs Will Skyrocket Price To $15, Forecasts Analyst
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-etfs-will-skyrocket-price-to-15/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T18:00:21Z
Full Content:
Following Bitwise’s and Rex Shares’ recent application for spot Dogecoin ETFs in the United States, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided a technical outlook suggesting Dogecoin (DOGE) could ascend to $15. His analysis, detailed in a logarithmic chart spanning from 2017 to 2025, captures a massive ascending channel that highlights the potential upward trajectory for DOGE. Martinez’s chart delineates a long-term ascending channel where Dogecoin’s price action is bounded by a structure consisting of three parallel trendlines. The lowest of these lines has consistently served as a firm support since 2017, aiding the price to stabilize during significant downturns, notably in early 2019 and again in mid-2022. The median line of the channel, which presently hovers around $0.40 to $0.45, has just been tested by DOGE as it recently surged to this level, marking a critical inflection point that was last touched in early 2022. The upper boundary of the channel, which is the focus of Martinez’s bullish forecast, is projected to climb well above $10, touching as high as $15 by late 2025. This top trendline is not just a theoretical limit but has proven to be the bull run top twice for the Dogecoin price, once in January 2018 and then in May 2021. At the last all-time high in May 2021, Doge even significantly exceeded the channel. Martinez’s prediction highlights the spot Dogecoin ETFs as potential market catalysts. He suggests that the approval and launch of such financial products could channel fresh institutional and retail investment into DOGE, propelling it towards these higher valuations. In trading terms, the current position of DOGE below the median line is pivotal. This price level has historically acted as a springboard for upward movement when sustained buying pressure is present. Should DOGE maintain its footing above this zone, the pathway to higher resistance levels around $1.00, and potentially the channel’s upper echelon near $15, appears technically feasible. Notably, the spot Doge ETFs could hit the market as early as April, according to Bloomberg’s ETF specialist Eric Balchunas. Bitwise officially lodged the application to register a Dogecoin ETF on Wednesday. The company submitted its proposal, named the “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF,” to the Delaware Division of Corporations, which is part of the U.S. Department of State. Although such registrations can occasionally be misleading, Balchunas confirmed via X: “Bitwise Doge ETF likely coming soon.. and yes I checked and this is def legit (vs some whack job committing forgery for a quick pump a la BlackRock XRP that one time).” Registering in Delaware represents an initial step before advancing to a formal ETF submission with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This registration process sets up the legal structure that would manage the proposed ETF but does not constitute a direct application for SEC approval. This initiative follows an earlier application by investment firms Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, both of which have also filed applications for multiple cryptocurrency ETFs, including one focused on Dogecoin. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.34. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: IP in the Octagon: Saving Live Sports from Digital Piracy
URL: https://ipwatchdog.com/2025/01/23/ip-octagon-saving-live-sports-digital-piracy/id=185316/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T17:15:30Z

January 23, 2025, 12:15 PM 0 Share IPWatchdog LIVE Moves to March in 2025: “Growth metrics for platforms like Starzplay will remain stagnant unless legal frameworks, technological innovation, and skilled IP professionals converge to reshape the landscape of content distribution in the region.” The evolution of content distribution has been both a boon and a bane for the entertainment industry. From physical formats like CDs and DVDs to digital streaming over satellite, fiber-optic networks, 5G, and Wi-Fi, the rapid technological advancements have brought unmatched convenience to viewers. The shift feels seamless: connect a smart TV to Wi-Fi, and the days of waiting for the cable guy are over. For television show producers, however, the transition has come at a steep cost. Take, for instance, the creators and distributors of movies and live premium events. They have seen their revenue streams severely impacted, not immediately but gradually, as digital platforms opened doors to new vulnerabilities. In the past, the model was straightforward: install a satellite dish, pay a subscription, and gain access to live sports and Hollywood movies. Today, it’s a different story. Consumers can share Wi-Fi costs with neighbors or, worse, bypass paywalls entirely by typing “watch UFC live for free” into a search engine. Within seconds, dozens of links appear, granting free access to what should have been an $80 pay-per-view event. Let’s look at the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a massively profitable martial arts promotion company. Despite its financial success, it is losing a significant amount of revenue to piracy. UFC CEO Dana White has repeatedly highlighted the massive challenges piracy creates, often calling out illegal streaming platforms and warning of legal action. Yet, pirates just laugh and openly mock these threats. One even tweeted in response to White: “Come and get it then, Dana. He’s desperate, making up lies and praying it scares away a few hundred people from clicking the link.” The challenges for content creators like the UFC are twofold. First, the market for pirated streams thrives because many fans either cannot or will not pay for legitimate access. Studies show that about 11% of U.S. adults admit to pirating live sports, TV, or movies, citing high costs as the primary reason. For millennials, the percentage climbs even higher, with nearly two-thirds acknowledging they’ve watched sports through unofficial streams. This behavior has real economic consequences. The Harvard Business Review estimates that piracy costs the global sports industry approximately $28 billion annually. The losses trickle down in ways many consumers don’t consider. Players, for example, have collective bargaining agreements that tie salaries to league revenues. When TV revenue declines due to piracy, salary caps tighten, directly impacting athlete earnings. It’s not just high-profile athletes who suffer; ordinary Americans employed by league media arms or regional sports networks also face layoffs when subscription and advertising revenue drops. The perception that piracy is a victimless crime ignores these broader realities. The second challenge lies in outdated copyright laws. The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 places the burden of enforcement on content creators. This notice-and-takedown system requires creators to identify infringements and report them to online service providers (OSPs), who are then expected to act “expeditiously.” But the definition of “expeditiously” is vague and varies by case. UFC executive vice president Riché T. McKnight testified before Congress in 2023 that some OSPs take hours or even days to remove pirated content. By that time, the economic damage is done. Failing to combat piracy risks losing an entire continent of viewers. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches to intellectual property rights and content distribution. The Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, boasts a rich history of martial arts and warrior traditions deeply embedded in its cultural identity. Combat sports such as wrestling and grappling have longstanding roots in the region, with practices like Koshti Pahlavani and Yagli Gures exemplifying traditions of martial honor and prowess. In Saudi Arabia, these practices often intertwine with Islamic values, framing martial arts as both physical disciplines and pathways to spiritual and personal development, frequently influenced by Sufi teachings. It’s no surprise, then, that combat sports have a significant audience in the Middle East. But while people in the region enjoy watching martial arts on television, the question remains: are they willing to pay for it? In April 2024, the UFC partnered with Starzplay to secure exclusive broadcasting rights in the Middle East and North Africa. Starzplay’s dedicated UFC channel promised comprehensive access to UFC content through its mobile application. Yet, did this strategic move meet expectations? The results suggest otherwise. Starzplay’s subscriber base remains modest at 2.9 million. By comparison, ESPN+ boasts 25.6 million subscribers, while Amazon Prime has reached a staggering 200 million. To put it bluntly, the initiative fell far short of expectations. The root of the issue lies in entrenched habits and a lack of a robust culture surrounding intellectual property rights. Changing the way viewers consume content requires more than exclusive deals; it demands a concerted effort to foster respect for legal streaming. Only a new culture of intellectual property management can transform these habits. Growth metrics for platforms like Starzplay will remain stagnant unless legal frameworks, technological innovation, and skilled IP professionals converge to reshape the landscape of content distribution in the region. Conventional business models in sports and premium television inadvertently facilitate content leakage, especially during live sports broadcasts. Current security measures, such as fingerprinting or watermarking technologies, are ineffective. It could be argued that within the context of news media distribution, video streaming represents a vital aspect of critical infrastructure, making it susceptible to malicious software attacks. In one example where the FBI disarmed a malware called Emotet, the agency explained how the malware worked: Usually delivered through an infected email attachment or link, the nimble and ever mutating code was able to slip past most virus detection software”. The concept of “appointment viewing”—television programming that individuals prioritize to watch during its original broadcast time due to a strong desire to witness events within the specified timeframe—exposes live sports content to significant risks of intellectual property (IP) rights violations. Sports leagues and media conglomerates stand to lose substantial audiences within minutes. This is due to the brief time it takes for viewers to search for alternative, unauthorized, free, or very cheap streams to watch live games or UFC fights. Preventing such leaks is time-critical, as audience interest rapidly declines once a live event concludes. Content is particularly vulnerable to unauthorized live redistribution while a sporting event is in progress. Is the centralization of video distribution the problem here? In traditional a video streaming platform, where one of the users pays for using the platform nothing stops that person to redistribute that televised live sport event. With the help of blockchain, the issue of ownership can be addressed at a protocol level. Blockchain helps the creators and the audience encrypt their videos and store those videos permanently using the IPFS swarm. Blockchain broadcasts the live sporting event in an autonomous manner with the help of various relay nodes and IPFS, thereby maintaining transparency and integrity of ownership in a decentralized way. It echoes overall U.S. Government strategy. The United States acknowledges the potential inherent in the modernization of its cryptographic technologies, which shall now encompass blockchain technology and its capacity to augment security and transparency. As the former U.S. Presidential Administration has explained, “digital connectivity should be a tool that uplifts and empowers people everywhere, not one used for repression and coercion.” Per the National Cybersecurity Strategy, “new and updated cybersecurity regulations must be calibrated to meet the needs of national security and public safety, in addition to the security and safety of individuals, regulated entities, and their employees, customers, operations, and data.” Implementing blockchain technology will inevitably help sport broadcasting giants to grow subscription numbers. Once streaming sporting event is “live”, the blocks, which are stored on a multitude of servers throughout the world, cannot be changed. As a result, sport Leagues and producers of the live broadcasts will have total control over their work. Blockchain-based television streaming systems is a new generation of digital infrastructure, that offer transparency through decentralization, allowing participating parties to verify data and transactions, avoid harmful cyber incidents. It is an example of “sector-specific engagement with industry to construct consistent, predictable regulatory frameworks for cybersecurity that focus on achieving security outcomes and enabling continuity of operations and functions, while promoting collaboration and innovation”. Put simply, it is a matter of national interest. The journey of the UFC in the Middle East illustrates the importance of live streaming in a region where cultural appreciation for combat sports runs deep. With smart TVs becoming increasingly accessible—not just in developed nations but globally—the potential audience for live sports is enormous. We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to chaos—a world where video pirates evolve into organized crime syndicates, dominating the streaming landscape. The other path offers a vision of fairness and innovation: a distributed network governed by blockchain technology, fostering harmony between creators and consumers.

Title: Amazon resumes new US green card applications for foreign workers, leaked memo shows
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-reopens-green-card-applications-for-foreign-workers-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-23T16:59:50Z
Full Content:
Amazon has resumed the green-card application process for foreign workers, a sign of an improving job market. In an internal note from late 2024, obtained by Business Insider, Amazon told employees that it planned to reopen PERM processing on January 6. Amazon had suspended all new PERM filings in 2023 and throughout 2024, citing "labor market conditions," BI previously reported. PERM is part of the US Labor Department's permanent labor certification process and is typically the first step toward getting a green card for a foreign worker. The goal is to prove that hiring foreign workers won't affect US job seekers' opportunities, wages, or working conditions. The note didn't explain why Amazon was resuming the PERM process. But the change may reflect Amazon's outlook for a more competitive job market. It also follows Donald Trump's campaign proposal to give green cards to foreign graduates of US colleges. "We evaluate our PERM program based on market analysis and have been planning to reopen it for the last 9 months," Amazon's spokesperson said in an email to BI. Amazon has been making major job cuts since late 2022, laying off at least 27,000 employees. Just last week Amazon let go about 200 people in its fashion and fitness group, BI reported. Richard Herman, a Cleveland-based immigration lawyer who founded the Herman Legal Group, said that resuming PERM filings indicates Amazon sees a possible "rebound" in the job market. Herman said some companies previously suspended green-card filings because of widespread layoffs and the cost and time required to process PERMs with the Labor Department. With PERM, companies have to demonstrate that laid-off employees aren't qualified for the jobs intended for foreign workers while also notifying US workers laid off within the past six months of the anticipated PERM filing. That takes a lot of money and time. "If employers are reconsidering getting back into the PERM game, it's because their cost/benefit analysis suggests labor market changes favor a more competitive market in some occupations, justifying the costs/time invested in PERM," Herman said. Tech companies are still laying off employees and applying more stringent performance reviews. But the hiring trend may improve. The HR-software maker Karat said in a 2024 report that the average hiring target for software engineer roles among US tech companies was up by 12% year over year. Stripe laid off 300 employees this week but said it planned to grow its total head count by roughly 1,000 this year, BI previously reported. "Tech in the Bay Area is definitely hiring more, and so they have a positive view of what's ahead," Bill Hing, an immigration law professor at the University of San Francisco, told BI. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he'd like to give green cards to every foreign graduate of US colleges as part of a plan to attract more skilled immigrants. That has led to a clash between the Elon Musk-led pro-Trump tech leaders and the hardcore MAGA base over the legal immigration of skilled workers. While it's possible Trump will commit to his proposal, he hasn't publicly addressed it since, and he could change his mind. Trump's campaign clarified last year that his proposal would apply only to the "most thoroughly vetted" foreign students. Jennifer Gordon, a labor and immigration law professor at Fordham University, told BI that companies might be trying to anticipate Trump's unpredictable behavior. Given Trump's past hard-line stance against immigration, Gordon said it's possible the new administration would issue a policy pausing skilled labor immigration applications in the future. "If I was a tech company, I wouldn't be fully confident that he will follow through," Gordon said. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

BlackRock, one of the biggest investment companies in the world, has given crypto enthusiasts a new reason to be excited. Its CEO, Larry Fink, has said that Bitcoin can be expected to make huge price moves, potentially reaching the $700K mark soon. The BlackRock CEO explained how political and economic instability is acting as a catalyst for Bitcoin, which serves as an internationally recognized currency free from any local fears. What’s more, Bitcoin is still holding steady above $104K, with a 12% uptick in the last month. With all the signs looking positive for BTC, and keeping in mind that the overall crypto market follows Bitcoin’s footprints, now is one of the best times to be a crypto investor. To help you out, here are 5 crypto presales that can offer up to a 100x return. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has undoubtedly been one of the best crypto presale performances to date. Launched just over a month ago, $WEPE’s presale has already raised over $57.5M, with both retailers and whales gobbling it up at a breakneck pace. The presale ends in 24 days, so this could be your last chance to grab one of the best meme coins. What makes Wall Street Pepe stand out is its personal vendetta against crypto whales, who have been abusing insider information to manipulate the crypto market and feast on innocent retailers. The project aims to eliminate this lopsidedness by creating a frog army of retail investors and providing them with unique market insights, trading strategies, and real-time alpha calls. If you, too, want to beat the market and become a profitable crypto investor, join the $WEPE army for just $0.0003665 per token. For more, here’s how to buy $WEPE. Solaxy ($SOLX) has been created to unlock the full potential of Solana, which currently struggles with issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy has set aside a healthy 30% of its total token supply to resolve these issues. After raising $350K in the first 24 hours, the $SOLX presale is still going strong, with the total presale purse reaching over $13M. Don’t miss out on one of the next 100x meme coins, and get some for only $0.001612 each. Here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-sovereign AI agent with the ability to adapt and form his own opinions, as well as drive conversations and trends on dApps and online platforms such as X. $MIND uses hive-mind analysis to identify market trends before anybody else. He’ll then share his insights and access to new investment opportunities on his X and Telegram channels, giving token holders a real edge in the market. You can grab the best AI agent coin for just $0.0031762 if you get in now — here’s how to buy $MIND. Prices increase in the next 11 hours, so interested investors should hurry up. $RXS is the native currency of Rexas Finance, an interesting crypto project that’s tokenizing real-world assets, such as real estate, gold, art, and commodities. The biggest benefit of this platform is that it simplifies investments. Investing in gold and other precious metals, for instance, will no longer be difficult and will involve just a few clicks. Plus, token holders will get to participate in fractional ownership. For example, let’s say there’s a massive mansion spread across multiple acres of land, and you don’t have enough funds to buy it all by yourself. In that case, you can use Rexas to own a fraction of the property for a fraction of the price. Speaking of $RXS’s presale, it’s coming to an end, meaning prices aren’t as low as they were, say, a couple of months ago. However, they’re still the lowest you’ll ever get them for. Each token is priced at $0.200, with the total presale funding at $43M so far. Out of the 500,000,000 total token supply, 434,925,318 have already been sold. $LHUNT is the official token of the LuckHunter online casino. The platform itself is like any other: you can play casino games, bet, and win. However, what makes it unique is it lets you create a metaverse of your own digital casinos that you can rent. These casinos will be based in different cities, Las Vexus and Utlantic City (modeled after the real Las Vegas and Atlantic City), and you can lease the tables at your virtual casino for short-term or long-term profits. You can also customize the tables and ambiance and create your own gaming rules. What’s more, you can even host VIP events involving high-stakes games and special tournaments to earn luxurious rewards. 1 $LHUNT is currently available for $0.00138, but the price will increase by 10.5% as it enters the next stage of presale in just a couple of hours from now. Having already raised $1.1M in its ongoing presale, $LHUNT’s official website mentions that its potential listing price will be $0.005, which is more than 260% of the current price. While there’s little doubt that the above-mentioned crypto presales can go to the moon in 2025, it’s important to mix caution with chaos and only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. There will be ups and downs, so make sure you do enough cardio to prepare your heart! Also, none of the above is financial advice, and we highly recommend doing your own research (DYOR) before investing.

Title: USDC supply hits $2B – Are investors being cautious around Bitcoin?

Time Published: 2025-01-23T16:00:11Z

Investor risk appetite is shrinking, driving up demand for USDC. Is it time to pull back? Are investors pulling back in the New Year? USD Coin [USDC] supply has surged to $2 billion – its highest in 707 days, while the global crypto market cap falls 3.49%. History hints at a pullback, but with the current volatility, could a crash be looming instead? Trump’s inauguration is behind us, the SEC has approved its first crypto regulation, and Bitcoin is still 6.18% below its $109K all-time high. No doubt, this week’s volatility has investors divided – some are pulling back, while others are HODLing strong, leaving BTC caught in a tug-of-war. The good news? BTC is holding above $100K, a level that’s sparked rebounds recently. In the last two weeks, BTC has dropped to this level three times, each time triggering an increase in outflows. Looks like investors are seeing this as a dip to buy. However, Bitcoin is just 3.54% above its weekly gains that pushed it past $109K. If those gains slip, BTC could fall to $98.4K. Adding to the caution, USDC supply has spiked to a two-year high. In just three days, USDC across exchanges dropped 17.21%, with Binance seeing an 18% decline. The jump in USDC supply to $2 billion from just $303K the previous day isn’t a fluke – investors are clearly playing it safe. Source: CryptoQuant As more investors move to USDC or cash out after realizing profits, the pressure to absorb this liquidity now falls on institutions. MicroStrategy is doing its part, having already made two purchases totaling 3,600 BTC this month alone. And it doesn’t stop there. BlackRock just made their largest Bitcoin buy of the year – $600 million worth of BTC. Could this be a sign of more institutional buying ahead that could stabilize the market? Despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, ETFs are seeing steady inflows, keeping BTC above $100K with institutional support. However, the decline in greed signals a shrinking risk appetite, with investors flocking to stablecoins like USDC instead of Bitcoin. The debate over Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ is clearly intensifying. In fact, $818 million worth of Tether USD (ERC20) coins moved off exchanges just a day before Trump’s swearing-in ceremony – the largest outflow in a year. Source: CryptoQuant Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 With Trump’s radical policies already grabbing headlines, it’s no surprise investors are exercising caution. Now, with stability in question, the focus is on which asset will dominate – stablecoins or Bitcoin. For now, stablecoins seem to have the upper hand, but the battle is far from over.

Title: Why EA Stock Is Diving Today

Video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) is plummeting 17% after the company reported lower-than-expected bookings for its fiscal third quarter that ended in December. EA also cut its full-year bookings guidance for its current fiscal year. EA blamed the bad news primarily on the subpar performance of its new soccer game, EA Sports FC 2025. A Look at EA's Results and Guidance The firm generated Q3 bookings of $2.22 billion last quarter, below its prior outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion. Moreover, the video game maker now expects its bookings for its current full fiscal year to come in at $7 billion to $7.15 billion, versus its previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Also importantly, EA is predicting that its bookings obtained after game purchases will fall by about 5% during its current fiscal year. It had previously predicted that this metric would climb by about 5%. The company's latest soccer game, EA Sports FC 25 "underperformed our net bookings expectations,” CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement. After reviews of the game were underwhelming following its release last September, the revenue generated by the company's soccer games is expected to drop this quarter versus the same period a year earlier. The Recent Price Action of EA Stock In the last month, the shares have sunk 21.5%, while they have slumped 19% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of EA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. The focus is now on Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday for more insight into his trade policy. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to poor performance of two of its video games: its soccer title, EA Sports FC 2025, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Both of those missed expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on February 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped roughly 0.2%, coming off a record intraday high on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% as tech stocks struggled. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sliped along with Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff." Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on Feb. 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President Trump at the World Economic Forum.

US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit.

See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff."

Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday.

Title: CNN boss Mark Thompson confirms 200 layoffs across cable TV network in digital push
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/23/business/cnn-boss-mark-thompson-confirms-200-layoffs-in-digital-push/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T14:03:23Z
Full Content:
CNN boss Mark Thompson on Thursday revealed sweeping changes at the embattled network that include 200 job cuts and a pivot to a more digital-centric strategy, the company said. The layoffs at the Warner Bros Discovery-owned network will amount to 6% of CNN’s workforce – mainly producers, editors and other non-air talent vital to the TV operation. Thompson, the former New York Times executive who pushed the Gray Lady toward a digital future, laid out his vision for a revamped CNN in an internal memo obtained by The Post. “Our objective is a simple one: to shift CNN’s gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting,” Thompson wrote. As part of the overhaul, Thompson confirmed reports earlier in the week that veteran anchor Wolf Blitzer will be moved from his afternoon slot to host a morning show with Pamela Brown at 10 a.m. – a decision that will cost frequent Donald Trump critic Jim Acosta his morning gig. Acosta is expected to be exiled to a midnight shift, a decision that has left him fuming and reportedly threatening to quit. With the job cuts, CNN seeks to streamline its cable TV lineup and enhance its digital subscription offerings to better align with evolving viewer trends. Thompson said CNN has started development on a new streaming service for news programming similar to its TV product. CNN also plans to launch a new lifestyle-oriented product this year, the memo said, adding that CNN is looking to open up and fill at least 100 new posts in the coming months as part of the shift to digital. “Some of today’s announcements mean significant new job opportunities at CNN, but others will lead to the loss of some valued colleagues,” Thompson wrote in the memo. “That too is an unwelcome but inevitable part of the change process.” CNN declined to comment. NBC News, owned by Comcast, also announced job cuts late Thursday that are reportedly expected to include up to a few dozens staffers. In October, CNN introduced a digital paywall requiring some users to pay $3.99 per month for access to its content. The move aimed to create a new digital revenue stream as the network looks to offset the decline in TV. The digital efforts were financed by a $70 million investment from WBD, Thompson added.

Never miss a story. “This is a moment where the digital story feels like an existential question,” Thompson told the New York Times. “If we do not follow the audiences to the new platforms with real conviction and scale, our future prospects will not be good.” Warner Bros Discovery is undergoing significant restructuring and said last month that it plans to split its cable TV networks from its streaming and studio operations, forming two separate units. Under the new structure, the cable TV business — including CNN, TNT and Animal Planet — will be consolidated into a unit named Global Linear Networks. “In the end, this is about CNN being — as it has been in its history — an indispensable way in which many, many millions of people get their news,” Thompson told the Times. The shakeup comes as CNN – which has attempted to tack toward the center since WBD acquired the network in a merger in 2022 – lags far behind cable rivals Fox News and left-leaning MSNBC. CNN’s viewership has only gotten worse since Trump won the election and its web traffic has also suffered, hitting a two-year low in December, according to analytics firm Comscore. The network recorded 90.5 million unique visits that month – down from a peak of 175.5 million in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the firm said. CNN told the Times other news networks have seen similar declines. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, said earlier this month it would lay off about 4% of its workforce or less than 100 employees in a bid to cut costs, as the storied newspaper grapples with growing losses. In November, the Associated Press said it would cut about 8% of its workforce as it looks to modernize its operations and products. Advertisement

Title: AI crypto coins take over: Is Trump’s $500B investment behind it all?

The future of crypto is AI—and it’s happening now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has real-world applications across industries like business, technology, healthcare, and finance. The crypto sector is no exception, with AI-based tokens now commanding a market cap of $48 billion. Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance may have rattled the broader market, but his $500 billion AI investment sent AI crypto coins soaring, with low-caps jumping 15% in 24 hours. Nvidia (NVDA) has now dethroned Apple (AAPL) as the world’s largest company, with a market cap soaring to $311 trillion – up 4.43% since Trump’s $500 billion AI investment. This is a clear sign that the AI revolution is taking off. AI-based crypto tokens aren’t far behind. In just two years, the market cap of AI-focused crypto coins surged by a massive 2,592%, reaching a staggering $70 billion by November last year. Leading the charge? NEAR Protocol [NEAR], boasting a solid market value of $5.89 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap But that’s just the beginning. Take Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), for instance, jumping into the ‘AI agent’ space, which Microsoft’s CEO just called the future of software development. Clearly, these coins are tapping into the tech to create real-world applications that are catching the eye of both individuals and institutional investors. However, the AI crypto market isn’t immune to volatility. In just two months, its market cap took a 31% dip, as the broader crypto market saw massive profit-taking. Can Trump’s $500 billion AI investment turn things around? Right now, Trump’s actions are shaking up the crypto world. Take the TRUMP memecoin, for example, which has seen billions in market cap vanish after Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance in his first 42 executive orders. Bitcoin is also feeling the squeeze, with its market share down 7% to $2.02 trillion. And AI crypto coins? They’re not immune, with many slipping into the red. Source: CoinMarketCap But there’s hope on the horizon. Trump’s massive $500 billion investment could spark a major rebound for AI tokens. We’ve seen these coins surge after Nvidia’s quarterly reports in the past, and with AI sentiment at an all-time high in the U.S., the future looks promising. Read NEAR Protocol’s [NEAR] Price Prediction 2025–2026 The road ahead won’t be easy, though. AI crypto coins need to break free from Bitcoin’s volatility and carve out their own space. But with a 2592% growth in less than three years, they’re on the right track. As tech giants gear up for the AI revolution, more capital could flood into the AI crypto coins. 2025 could be their year – definitely one to watch.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Altria Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business A look at the shareholders of Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Altria Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Altria Group Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Altria Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Altria Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Altria Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Altria Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$63m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 39% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Altria Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Altria Group (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is the undisputed king of the meme coins, with a market cap of about $56 billion. The coin has been in a roaring rally since late last year, rising by 355%, and, with the Trump administration signaling a serious pro-crypto bent, it's no surprise that investors are interested in making big gains with a purchase. Is it possible to make a decent sum of $10,000 with a timely investment in this meme, even if your starting capital is on the small side? In the closing of the recent trading day, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) stood at $240.91, denoting a +0.25% change from the preceding trading day. The Nasdaq Composite gained 30% in 2024, while Ark Innovation ETF returned 8.4%. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) shares are trading lower on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $36. Halliburton reported a fourth-quarter revenue decline of 2.3% year-over-year to $5.610 billion, missing the consensus of $5.63 billion. Completion and Production revenue fell 4.2% YoY to $3.2 billion, with $629 million operating income. The analyst noted that softer revenue was mainly due to a decline in Completion and Produc Energy Transfer LP (ET) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock. Advertising revenue doubled this past year, co-CEO Gregory Peters said, and the company expects the same to be true in 2025. Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast, with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes, as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. Vistra stock was rising Tuesday after authorities lifted evacuation orders issued because of a fire at a company power plant last week. The utility stock gained 8.8% to $185.83 in afternoon trading, on track for an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The fire took place at a lithium-ion battery facility at a Vistra power plant in Moss Landing, Calif. Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Super Micro (SMCI). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Amazon UK Boss Says “Greater Share” Of Prime Video TV Spend Shifting To Britain, But Streamer Would Never Have Commissioned ‘Mr Bates’
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/01/amazon-uk-commissioning-spend-mr-bates-lord-of-the-rings-1236263880/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T08:55:34Z

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Prime Video is shifting a greater share of its overall TV spend to Britain, according to Amazon UK boss Chris Bird. Bird was speaking on a Royal Television Society (RTS) panel predicting the year in UK TV, alongside the likes of Fremantle UK boss Amelia Brown, who said the industry has “lost its guts a bit” when it comes to taking risks. Bird said Amazon commissioning budgets are “really healthy and strong” this year in Britain despite American contraction, and “as we go forward a greater share of investment at global level is centered here in the UK.” Last year, Amazon initiated a major international restructure that saw layoffs in the Africa and MENA regions as focus shifted to Europe, although there were also some European firings amid the downturn. Related Stories News 'The Traitors UK' Season 3 Crowns Winner On BBC One News Manager-Producer Rory Rosegarten On Relishing The "Tough Fight" Of Today's Hollywood, Connecting With Tom Green & Why 'Everybody Loves Raymond' Will Never Be Rebooted Bird pointed to Amazon tentpole Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which is filmed in the UK and “works disproportionately well in the UK but the remit and ambition is to perform globally,” along with local hits like Clarkson’s Farm, which was made “specifically for Brits.” Watch on Deadline Amazon won’t be tempted to go as local as shows like Mr Bates vs the Post Office, however, with Bird acknowledging that the ITV smash was “too British” to have been commissioned by an American streamer. Go with your gut Bird was speaking on a panel alongside big hitters in the UK industry like Fremantle’s Brown, who delivered an impassioned plea for execs on both sides of the commissioning fence to take risks. “Our industry has maybe lost its guts a little bit [in terms of] going for what they believe in across the board,” she said. Brown cited BBC breakout The Traitors, which wraps up this week. “It got pitched around a few places and then the BBC said, ‘We will do it,’ so the gut instinct was there,” she explained. “Every broadcaster was then pitched versions of what we are now calling ‘psychological reality’. And that’s more on [producers] to say that derivatives and versions are never going to be the thing that hits so we need to go with our guts and with creativity.” Brown, who oversees the likes of The Apprentice, Britain’s Got Talent and Too Hot To Handle, said this is becoming trickier as young viewers disengage from traditional TV. With this in mind, BBC unscripted boss Kate Phillips argued the corporation’s biggest rival is no longer the streamers but is now YouTube, TikTok and gaming. “We want to grow love of the BBC with the young and they are becoming very distracted by these other platforms,” she added. “It’s about making them aware of the things we’ve got sometimes – a good show is a good show but it’s about getting [young people] off their devices and off YouTube.” The BBC is struggling to fund big-budget drama at present but Phillips said premium unscripted is not being hit in the same way due to its lower cost, although she is still busily seeking partnerships “We are not as reliant as drama is [on co-pro money] and can still fully fund programs but in terms of upping the ambition we are certainly open to partnerships,” she added, citing the BBC’s tie-up with NBC, which birthed The Traitors, and second window deals with the likes of BBC Studios-owned channel group UKTV. The trio were speaking in London at the RTS session. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

January 22, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA) Class Period: February 7, 2024 - November 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava’s leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Cassava class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SAVA MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Title: Why Amazon’s Decision in Quebec Raises Familiar Questions
URL: https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/why-amazons-decision-in-quebec-raises-familiar-questions
Time Published: 2025-01-23T01:16:07Z
Full Content:
Good e-Reader 22 January 2025 by Angela Waterfield 2 Comments Amazon recently announced it’s closing all its operations in Quebec.This move will cut about 1,950 jobs, including 1,700 full-time workers. The company says it’s shifting back to a third-party delivery model, claiming this will save customers money. But labor unions and critics are asking: Is this really about saving money, or is it about getting rid of unionized workers? This isn’t the first time Amazon’s decisions have raised eyebrows. In February 2023, I wrote about Amazon laying off 18,000 workers. At the time, the company blamed inflation, slowing sales, and supply chain issues. But many of us questioned whether those layoffs were more about automation and avoiding unions. What’s happening in Quebec now feels like history repeating itself. One of the sites closing is the DXT4 warehouse in Laval, Amazon’s first unionized warehouse in Canada. Workers there joined the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) in May 2024 and were negotiating their first contract when the closure was announced. The CSN says Amazon’s decision targets unionized workers and violates the Quebec Labour Code. Amazon denies any ill intentions and accuses the CSN of spreading false information. It’s worth noting that the CSN aren’t alone in wondering about this- as just last August, a Quebec labor tribunal ruled against Amazon for interfering in union efforts at another site in Lachine. Automation seems to play a big role in Amazon’s decisions. While the company hasn’t said the Quebec closures are about robots, it’s worth noting that Amazon has been building more robotic warehouses where machines do the work people used to do. There’s also the issue of unionization. Unionized workers typically earn around 10% more and receive more comprehensive benefits than their non-unionized counterparts. They’re also more likely to have better access to employer-sponsored health plans and paid sick days. For a company focused on minimizing costs, unionized workers may represent a financial challenge Amazon would rather avoid. By closing its only unionized warehouse in Canada, Amazon may be signaling a preference for non-unionized labor, where wages and benefits can remain lower. This pattern raises questions about whether cost-cutting decisions are being made under the guise of automation or operational efficiency while effectively undermining workers’ rights. Amazon says the switch to third-party delivery in Quebec is an operational decision. But the timing—right after unionization and during labor negotiations—feels off. Quebec’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne, came out criticizing the move, saying, “This is not the way business is done in Canada.” This isn’t just about Quebec or Canada for that matter. This trend is part of a larger story about how companies like Amazon are focusing on cutting costs and automating jobs, often at the expense of their workers. This story also highlights how hard it is for unions to protect workers in industries moving toward automation and AI. In my 2023 article, I wrote, “If you’re going to replace workers with robots because it’s cheaper and easier than dealing with unions, just be honest about it.” That still rings true. People appreciate transparency, and without it, companies risk losing the trust of their employees and customers. Amazon could take a different approach. It’s not impossible to invest in both technology and fair treatment for workers. Instead of seeing unions as the enemy, companies could work with them to find solutions that work for everyone. “Today’s workers need ongoing, incremental re-skilling or upskilling to maintain a stable or improving career path. Displaced workers need substantive retraining to get their next job or career. Young people entering the workforce need a foundation of skills aligned with their aptitudes and the prevailing demand for human labor.” – Yossi Sheffi Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.” Amazon’s actions in Quebec point towards a lack of transparency and honesty. Perhaps these closures have nothing to do with unions, but until they’re willing to be fully upfront on their reasoning, people will continue to ask tough questions about their motives. It doesn’t help that Amazon has a long history of questionable business practices and has been the subject of several lawsuits; including antitrust, class action, and lawsuits over product recall. Companies like Amazon need to realize that innovation and fairness can go hand in hand, and it’s time they start proving it.

Our armed forces stand as the ultimate protectors of our nation, braving unimaginable risks every day. It is only fitting that a centrally funded life and health insurance scheme be made mandatory for them at all levels—this is not just financial security, but a tribute to their unwavering service. Equally crucial is the need to nurture a strong talent pipeline for the insurance industry. Establishing government-backed educational institutes and skill development centers will empower young professionals, ensuring insurance reaches the grassroots and secures every Indian’s future. Additionally, granting a GST waiver on retail life insurance and offering greater tax incentives for corporates providing group life and health policies will be transformative. These measures will accelerate the ‘Insurance for All by 2047’ vision, paving the way for a more resilient and financially inclusive India. We look forward to a budget that prioritizes these reforms and propels the industry to unprecedented heights.” WhatsApp Image 2025-01-23 at 15.05.07.jpeg WhatsApp Image 2025-01-23 at 15.03.42.jpeg Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on January 23, 2025, were 2,135 against 1,763 stocks that declined, and 133 remained unchanged.

India ranks #1 in the number of crypto holders and #3 in tech unicorns globally. Yet, we seem to have missed the Web3 tsunami, which doubled its market cap in 2024 and saw DeFi TVL surge by 2000% year-on-year. Ambiguity in crypto compliance and a regressive tax regime have hindered innovation, pushing startups and talent overseas. The RBI’s stance reflects a lack of understanding of decentralization’s intrinsic nature—it cannot be banned, only regulated. Meanwhile, nations like the U.S., Singapore, Russia, South Korea, and the UAE are embracing progressive policies to foster crypto innovation. The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. in 2024 underlines the importance of forward-looking regulations. In a country with thousands of tech startups, a thriving ecosystem, and globally leading talent, the crypto industry expects balanced taxation, clear compliance frameworks, and innovation-friendly policies. These are crucial to ensuring India remains in the forefront. The finance ministry and the RBI must mitigate risks without stifling growth. A progressive approach will unlock massive economic potential, create jobs, and solidify India’s position as a global leader in Web3 innovation Fitch Ratings believes increasing stress in Indian banks’ unsecured retail loan portfolios could pose risks to our projections for the sector’s asset quality in 2025.

Sameer Bansal, MD & CEO, PNB MetLife While India is a fast-growing economy fueled by its rising middle-class population of [25-45] year olds, the proportion of people above the age of 60 is equally increasing at a rapid pace. Financial stability is a cornerstone of a secure future. One of our hopes for the upcoming budget is to see support for pension and annuity plans which are key financial instruments for the retirement planning needed to create that stability. Tax support for pension plans offered by life insurers, on par with the National Pension Scheme, will provide both greater choice and allow diversification of assets into multiple pension plans. At the same time, while we recognize and applaud the ongoing deliberations on removing GST on term life and health policies, we urge the government to also consider removing GST on premiums for annuity plans to support pensioners and make annuities more affordable and accessible. These actions would give people greater flexibility to create and protect financial stability, which in turn is an important building block for the continuing economic growth of our country.

US$ has appreciated against all currencies sharply. With new President in the US promising further protectionism, every economy in the world needs to focus on its strong points and look more internal. Fiscal discipline along with other macro parameters would be critical in these times. India has done very well over the past few years on improving fiscal health and the government has articulated its target to achieve below 4.5% deficit for FY26E. Additionally, Finance Minister articulated the target to reduce debt to GDP sharply beyond FY27. It would be prudent to continue to walk the path of fiscal consolidation and reduce debt to GDP ratios for the country which will go a long way in sustaining growth in the long term.

The forthcoming union budget is poised to chart the course for the new Indian government’s economic growth agenda. On the back of the political stability and resilient economy, it is expected to provide relief to various sections of the society and benefits for various sectors. The budget 2025 has the opportunity to help provide the NBFC sector and retail investors with the much needed impetus. Below are a few recommendations where government support will go a long way in providing last-mile credit. Wishlist as a gold loan NBFC As a prominent player in this sector, we would like to continue to advocate to provide cushion and offer maximum benefit to customers by urging the government to grant eligible gold loan NBFCs with ‘priority sector status’. We believe that providing priority sector status to eligible gold loans NBFCs will be a step forward in driving financial inclusion as it majorly impacts the small borrowers whose borrowing needs are frequently less than Rs 50,000. We also propose for a ‘Gold linked credit line via UPI’ that can go a long way in helping households/small business owners meet their financing needs and monetise idle gold jewellery. Once the NBFCs are allowed to link with the UPI payment system, this will act as a secured credit that would be extended by NBFCs at a lower interest rate (12%-18%) compared to the high interest rates (around 36%) charged by credit cards. We further seek a level playing field by bridging the disparity and aligning the single counterparty exposure limits for gold loan NBFCs in comparison with other NBFCs i.e. 20% of Tier-1 capital. This restriction impacts the ability to lend credit and negatively impacts our potential customers. Wishlist for our retail NCD investors With the growing impetus on diversifying the funding mix of NBFCs, we would urge the regulators and government to simplify the taxation compliance on the TDS on listed NCDs which is currently at 10% TDS. The selling and re-selling of listed NCDs through stock exchanges ends up putting a taxation burden on the end investor. Since the TDS were introduced on listed securities keeping in mind that the customers are not paying the tax, however on ground there is an adequate trail of holders and interest payments. Our other recommendation is for allowing additional interest rate on Public Issue of Secured Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued to retail investors, pensioners and senior citizens over and above the interest rate applicable to institutional investors. We believe these regulations are crucial in order to attract more retail investors and ensure fair compensations to all our investors and stakeholders.

After a negative opening, Nifty can find support at 23,050 followed by 22,950 and 22,800. On the higher side, 23,250 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 23,350 and 23,500. The charts of Bank Nifty indicate that it may get support at 48,500 followed by 48,200 and 47,800. If the index advances further, 48,900 would be the initial key resistance, followed by 49,200 and 49,500. The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling on the 14th day as they offloaded equities worth Rs 4,026 crore on January 22, on the other hand, domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 3,500 crore on the same day. INDIAVIX was negative Yesterday down by 1.66% and is currently trading at 16.7725. Yesterday, the Indian markets experienced a highly volatile session. Selling pressure from higher levels dragged the Nifty index near the previous day’s low. However, buying activity from lower levels in the later session helped the market recover, leading to a close around the 23,150 mark. Global markets traded on a positive note, but Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers, raising concerns about the sustainability of the upward momentum. On the downside, the Nifty could test 22,800, followed by 22,500 levels, as the index continues to face selling pressure from higher levels. A breach below the 23,000 mark would be concerning. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen at 23,300, with the 23,500 level acting as a significant hurdle. Given the prevailing volatility, traders are advised to exercise caution, implement strict stop-loss strategies, and avoid carrying long positions overnight unless the Nifty index trades above the 23,500 mark to manage risk effectively. Hardik Matalia Derivative Analyst Yesterday, the Nifty tumbled below the 23,000 mark, while sectoral indices like Realty dropped 4.05%, and broader markets also saw losses. The India VIX surged 3.56%, and USD/INR remained firm at 86.57. Despite this, Gift Nifty is aiming for a rebound this morning, though uncertainty persists with US President Trump’s tariff threats on Canada, Mexico, and BRICS nations. Expect heightened volatility in 2025 with upcoming events like the Federal Reserve meeting, the Union Budget, and Delhi Assembly elections. Key stocks to watch today include HDFC Bank, HUL, Pidilite, BPCL, Polycab, Persistent Systems, Coforge, and Tata Communications, which are all reporting their Q3 earnings. “There are two trends in the market that deserve attention. One, the institutional activity is showing a consistent trend - sustained selling by FIIs and sustained buying by DIIs. Two, there is a trend towards quality - largecaps are resilient while the broader market is weakening. These two trends are likely to continue in the near-term. Since the dollar index and US bond yields continue to remain high FIIs are unlikely to turn buyers any time soon. This will cap a rally in the market even though the market is in an oversold zone. Largecap financials, IT and pharma can continue to support the market on declines.” Wall Street indices gained on Wednesday, driven by optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s private-sector investment plan for AI infrastructure, which bolstered technology stocks. The S&P 500 rose by 0.61%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.30%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.28%. In the Asia-Pacific markets, stocks opened on a mixed note as investors reacted to varying regional economic data. Indian benchmark indices are expected to open slightly lower, as suggested by the GIFT Nifty trading marginally in the red, reflecting mixed global cues. On the stock-specific front, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) announced that its board has approved the submission of a development plan for the Nunukan block’s oil and gas reserves to the Indonesian regulator, with an estimated investment of $121 million. Additionally, BPCL’s board approved the formation of a joint venture with Praj Industries Ltd. to set up Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) plants across India. After a positive start to the trading session, the benchmark index faced selling pressure within the opening minutes, resulting in a decline of 162 points during the first half. However, the index attracted modest buying interest near the support level of 22981, which helped it recover 183 points of losses and close in the upper quartile of the trading range. The area around 23060-23000 remains a pivotal support zone, and maintaining levels above it will be essential to garner bullish momentum. We open a 90D positive catalyst watch on PB Fintech. We expect the company’s new business growth to sustain in retail protection, retail health and savings business-key ingredients providing higher visibility on medium-to-long term revenue and profitability trajectory. While we do not rule out quarterly volatility in margin trajectory, annuity models’ operational performances are best viewed from incremental business flows/momentum, in our view. Management has reiterated their FY2027E PAT target of Rs10bn even considering any potential investment of up to US$100mn in proposed new venture. Effective execution of the hybrid/phy-gital strategy (~20-25% of core insurance premiums are getting converted in this model) drives constructiveness of ability to scale up life savings and high-ticket retail health businesses. Any favourable commentary from management on pickup in feet on street (# employees, indexed productivity, margin trajectory, etc.) could further revive investor sentiment. Capital Gain Tax Niranjan Govindekar, Partner, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Budget 2024 had made big changes to the capital gains tax framework, offering both challenges and benefits for investors. Some provisions need a relook. For instance, to streamline the capital gains tax structure by aligning tax rates/ period of holding across various sub-asset classes, for instance, treating international equities the same as domestic equities, debt funds the same as gold funds, and gold funds the same as gold ETFs.The hike in short-term rates from 15% to 20% and in long-term rates from 10% to 12.5% has raised investor tax liabilities significantly. Since now the LTCG tax on securities is on par with other assets, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) should be abolished. Budget 2024 unexpectedly removed the indexation benefit for all long-term investments in debt funds. It is expected that all investments in debt funds made up to 31 March 2023, would qualify for the indexation benefit as per earlier provisions. Tax implications on the buyback of shares - under the amended provisions, the entire consideration received is treated as dividends and taxed in the hands of the shareholders. It is recommended that the government amend the law to allow the cost of the acquisition of shares as a reduction and tax only the net amount as a dividend. Prashant Bhojwani, Partner, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India Two of the biggest asks of foreign investors in India are tax certainty and a reduced timeline for litigation. Earlier, the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) provided binding rulings that offered clarity and assurance to taxpayers and the tax department alike. This was one avenue to provide tax certainty to foreign investors. It is time to strengthen the framework of the Board for Advance Rulings and re-introduce the binding nature to provide much-needed certainty from a tax perspective to foreign investors. Currently, the maximum appeals are pending at the Commissioner (Appeals), the first appellate authority, with approximately 5.49 lakh appeals pending on April 1, 2024 (out of which 3.01 lakh appeals were filed before April 1, 2022) which does not read very well on India’s scorecard. The number of Commissioner (Appeals) needs to be increased to adjudicate pending appeals in an accelerated manner. A strict timeline (say 9 or 12 months) should be introduced to dispose of the appeals, similar to dispute resolution panel timelines.

Title: Microsoft Eases Control on OpenAI in $500B Venture

Time Published: 2025-01-23T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
In a significant development within the tech industry, Microsoft (MSFT) announced on Tuesday that it has revised key terms of its longstanding partnership with OpenAI. This change comes in the wake of OpenAI's announcement of a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group aimed at establishing a groundbreaking $500 billion network of AI data centers in the United States. The partnership dubbed the "Stargate" initiative, is designed to bolster the U.S.'s position in the global AI race, particularly against competitors like China. During a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump unveiled the Stargate project, emphasizing its importance for national competitiveness. The initiative aims to leverage advanced chips from Nvidia (NVDA) to enhance AI capabilities across various sectors. As part of this venture, OpenAI will have an equity stake and operational control, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman of the board. Historically, Microsoft has held exclusive rights to provide cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI since 2019. However, the new agreement allows OpenAI to explore additional capacity options, primarily for research and model training. This shift opens the door for OpenAI to collaborate with Oracle and potentially other cloud service providers. Despite these changes, Microsoft reassured stakeholders that its core partnership with OpenAI remains intact. The tech giant retains exclusive rights to offer OpenAI's API—an essential revenue source for the company—ensuring that Oracle will not host this critical service. In a blog post, Microsoft stated that "the key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030," including access to OpenAI's intellectual property and ongoing revenue-sharing arrangements. Microsoft also highlighted a recent commitment from OpenAI to utilize its Azure cloud services extensively, further solidifying their collaborative efforts. This commitment underscores Microsoft's role as a significant investor and partner in advancing OpenAI's technology. As the landscape of AI development evolves, this partnership adjustment signals a strategic pivot for both Microsoft and OpenAI. The Stargate project represents one of the largest investments in AI infrastructure to date, with initial funding of $100 billion set to expand over four years. This ambitious plan aims not only to enhance AI capabilities but also to create jobs and foster innovation within the U.S. The collaboration between Microsoft, Oracle, and other technology partners like Nvidia and Arm will be crucial in building out this infrastructure. As noted by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison during the announcement, construction is already underway in Texas, with plans for multiple data centers designed to support expansive AI operations. This evolving landscape presents an exciting opportunity for innovation in artificial intelligence. The collaboration between major players like Microsoft and OpenAI illustrates a commitment to advancing technology while navigating competitive pressures. As these companies work together to build robust AI infrastructure, it will be interesting to see how they balance exclusivity agreements with collaborative efforts that benefit the broader tech ecosystem. As we witness these transformative partnerships unfold, it is essential for stakeholders—be they investors, developers, or consumers—to stay informed about how these changes will impact technological advancements and market dynamics in the coming years. The future of AI is not just about competition; it's about collaboration that drives progress and innovation forward. ©2025 C# Corner. All contents are copyright of their authors.

Title: CNN plans to lay off hundreds of employees, cut costs as NBC plots firings
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/22/media/cnn-nbc-news-planning-mass-layoffs-report/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T22:30:50Z
Full Content:
CNN boss Mark Thompson reportedly plans to announce mass layoffs Thursday — just days after he warned top on-air talent including Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper that they ought to avoid “pre-judging” President Trump. The ratings-challenged cable news pioneer will lay off hundreds of employees as it refocuses the business around a global digital audience, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The job cuts come as CNN, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, looks to rearrange its linear TV lineup and build out digital subscription products, CNBC said, adding that it will help CNN lower production costs and consolidate teams. Some shows produced in New York or Washington may move to Atlanta, where production can be done more cheaply, the report said. NBC News, owned by Comcast, is also planning job cuts later this week, according to the report. While there is no exact number, the layoffs will be well under 50. Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, said earlier this month it would lay off about 4% of its workforce or less than 100 employees in a bid to cut costs, as the storied newspaper grapples with growing losses. In November, the Associated Press said it would cut about 8% of its workforce as it looks to modernize its operations and products. News of CNN’s culling comes after Thompson reportedly cautioned staffers “against expressing any outrage of their own” during the inauguration. Thompson, a former BBC and New York Times executive, convened a virtual editorial meeting Sunday that included Tapper, Cooper and scores of other senior news personalities to discuss CNN’s coverage of the inaugural ceremonies that took place the next day in Washington, DC, according to the Status newsletter. During the meeting, Thompson “made it clear that he did not want the coverage to relitigate the past,” according to Status reporter Oliver Darcy — an allusion to CNN’s historically hostile relationship with Trump. Thompson asked his charges to avoid editorializing as well as to steer coverage away from focusing on Trump’s legal problems, including convictions for falsifying business documents related to the alleged Stormy Daniels “hush money” payment, according to the report. Instead, he urged CNN staffers to focus on Trump’s second term and to be “open-minded” about the next four years, according to Status. A CNN spokesperson declined to comment. At the end of the call, Thompson reportedly opened the floor to allow staffers to ask questions, but nobody spoke up, the report said. “What Thompson and other top brass had communicated was clear and none of the meeting participants apparently had the desire to question the guidance,” Darcy wrote. On Tuesday, Thompson convened yet another virtual editorial call to reiterate his message. Thompson told CNN staff that they should remain “tough-minded” in coverage while at the same time being “fair-minded,” according to Status. During the call, Virginia Moseley, CNN’s executive editor, joked that CNN was “out of practice” handling the relentless news cycle generated by Trump, a challenge that will quickly intensify in the coming years. Thompson’s strategy marks a shift in the network’s coverage of Trump under former CNN boss Jeff Zucker. CNN has struggled to keep up with MSNBC and Fox News in the ratings race — which was reflected in the numbers for the inauguration. Fox News, which shares common ownership with The Post, dominated television viewership during Trump’s inauguration, drawing 10.3 million viewers between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET, surpassing all other networks. ABC (with 4.7 million viewers), NBC (4.4 million) and CBS (4.1 million) followed. With Post wires Advertisement

Title: Amazon to close Quebec facilities, but says it's not because of that new union

Amazon just announced it will be closing its Quebec facilities in the coming weeks, according to reporting by CBC . This move will cut more than 1,700 jobs. The company said it will begin outsourcing deliveries to smaller contractors, instead of relying on its in-house team. "Following a recent review of our Quebec operations," the company said in a statement, "we found that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to the one we had until 2020, will enable us to offer the same excellent service and deliver even greater savings to our customers in the long term." Amazon has announced it will shutter its facilities in Quebec in the coming weeks and cut more than 1,700 jobs. Quebec is home to Amazon's only unionized workforce in Canada. https://t.co/zG3XjTi1mH — CBC News (@CBCNews) January 22, 2025 Amazon has announced it will shutter its facilities in Quebec in the coming weeks and cut more than 1,700 jobs. Quebec is home to Amazon's only unionized workforce in Canada. https://t.co/zG3XjTi1mH This follows a successful unionization bid at an Amazon warehouse in Quebec. The workers joined the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), which represents around 330,000 people across many industries in Canada. Amazon allegedly fought these efforts, going on to say that union accreditation would not “respect the interests of its employees.” "This decision makes no sense whatsoever," CSN president Caroline Senneville said in a statement. "Neither from a business point of view, nor from an operational point of view. Amazon, one of the most integrated companies between the click of a mouse and home delivery, would entrust all its warehousing and distribution operations throughout Quebec to a third party?" Don’t worry. Amazon says the massive layoffs aren’t because of the aforementioned union, indicating it was a simple cost-cutting measure. We should absolutely take the company at its word because it has always been particularly friendly to unions and a friend to workers everywhere. That was sarcasm. In any event, it is expected that the company will close the facilities within the next two months. Employees will be given a severance package of some kind, but the details have yet to be revealed. Apropos of nothing, Amazon is worth nearly $2.5 trillion dollars. It has doubled in value in the past year or so.

Title: Apple vs. Tesla: Which Tech Giant Will Be the Better Investment in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing in stocks can take time and education to get it right and see significant returns. But even the most reliable stocks can go through surprising ups and downs based on a variety of economic factors. If you’re looking at two of the “Magnificent 7” stocks, Tesla and Apple, this year and wondering which is a better investment, that question may not be as straightforward as one over the other. Trending Now: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire — 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Check Out: 4 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money Stock experts explain what makes each company valuable and offer considerations for when you invest. To understand the value of a stock beyond just its current price on the stock market, investors use a ration known as the P/E ratio, essentially the price-to-earnings ratio, according to Charles Schwab. To get this figure, you divide the price of the stock (P) by the company’s annual per-share earnings (E). So if a stock is trading at around $20 per share, and its earnings are $1, it has a P/E of 20 ($20 divided by $1). Read Next: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You So currently, Tesla’s stock is currently trading at a P/E ratio of over 110, which is extremely high, according to Scott Ritchie, an investing expert at Stoculator. Tesla is a unique company because on the one hand, it’s a car company, but on another it’s also something of a tech company, depending on how you look at it. If you look at it as a car company, it’s an excellent value. Ritchie pointed out that its current market cap is $1.3 trillion, which is at least 20 times the market cap of General Motor and 30 times Ford’s market cap. “In 2024, Tesla produced 1.77 million cars, that makes it a mature car manufacturer in my opinion, and it should be valued as one. Not to mention that the 1.77 million cars is a drop in production from the 2023 1.84 million cars,” Ritchie said. If you look at it as a tech company, due to its heavy investment in AI and robotics, “It is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation especially since most of Tesla’s developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years,” Ritchie added. Compared to other tech companies with an over $1 trillion market cap like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company. On the other hand, Tesla may be doing well with its cars, but according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, “[Tesla hasn’t] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market. They don’t have as much money in the bank and it’s still quite a young company.” Apple is often considered a sure thing in stock, because of its dedicated consumer base and wide variety of products. However, Ritchie pointed out that Apple has seen very slow growth lately, both in sales and innovation of new products. “Last year they announced that they cancelled their decade-long electric-car project after spending $10 billion on it over the course of 10 years,” the investing expert said. “Their latest innovative product, the Apple Vision Pro, kicked off with a great debut but seem to have lost the attention soon after.” The canceled car project is likely a good thing, Ritchie said, because it could have been a “distraction” that took Apple away from what it’s good at. Overall, Ritchie added, “Apple could be a better investment than Tesla currently. It is more stable in terms of financial valuation and performance. It has a wider range of products with much less production challenges, that combined with the larger customer base makes a great profit-making formula.” Materazzi is in agreement. While Apple and Tesla are totally different companies they do share similarities. However, he said, “Apple is an extremely successful company with a long history, they have a lot of cash in the bank and their stock is often considered safe, relatively speaking among tech stocks. Apple is already a leader. Tesla is not.” The truth is, you probably can’t go wrong investing in either, or both, Materazzi said. Both stocks are part of the Magnificent 7, the big tech stocks. “Both stocks are frequently purchased by short-term speculators, even if Tesla is the original meme stock and may have a slight advantage in this,” he said. Tesla’s products may have better immediate returns, but “their products are more vulnerable in the marketplace,” Materazzi said. Apple is considered more stable but that also brings lower returns. Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor if you’re trying to decide between the two.

Title: What to know about 'Stargate,' the $500 billion AI infrastructure project touted by Trump

Time Published: 2025-01-22T18:24:00Z

After scrapping the Biden administration’s executive order on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan alongside some of the technology’s top leaders. The president was joined by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBY) chief executive Masayoshi Son, and Oracle (ORCL) chief technology officer Larry Ellison at the White House on Tuesday evening where he announced the Stargate Project, the largest in U.S. history. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment and counts OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders. Here’s what else you need to know about the Stargate Project. The Stargate project is investing in building new data centers and other AI infrastructure in the U.S. The investment “will secure” the U.S.’s AI leadership, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, “and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world,” according to OpenAI. Stargate will “support the re-industrialization of the United States” and “provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies,” the startup added. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. Elon Musk, a close Trump ally with his own AI startup, responded to the news on X that he has “on good authority” that the Japanese bank “has well under $10B secured.” Altman responded that Musk was “wrong” and invited the billionaire to visit the first site under construction. Along with OpenAI and Oracle, British chip design firm Arm (which SoftBank has a 90% stake in), Nvidia (NVDA), and OpenAI’s longstanding partner, Microsoft (MSFT), will be “key technology partners” in the project. OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia will work together on the project’s first buildout in Texas, OpenAI said, adding that the computing system is a result of a years-long collaboration between it and Nvidia, and a new partnership between it and Oracle. Ellison said Tuesday that the project’s first data centers are already under construction. “Each building is a half a million square feet,” Ellison said. “There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location.” The project is still evaluating other potential sites and finalizing definitive agreements. OpenAI said the project builds on its relationship with its largest investor and exclusive compute provider, Microsoft. The startup plans to continue increasing its use of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service, it said, alongside the “additional compute” from Stargate. In March, The Information reported that OpenAI and Microsoft were planning a U.S.-based data center that could cost up to $100 billion and house a supercomputer made up of millions of AI chips — also called “Stargate.” However, after it raised a $6.6 billion funding round in October, The Information reported that OpenAI was looking for other data center deals after its chief financial officer Sarah Friar had previously told some shareholders it wasn’t getting enough compute power fast enough from the tech giant. Microsoft said on Tuesday that a new agreement with OpenAI “includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity” and will follow a model where Microsoft has the right of first refusal. “To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models,” the company said. In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the company will continue spending $80 billion building out its cloud computing and that “customers can count on Microsoft with OpenAI models being there everywhere in the world.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Good Grief, Look How Much Wall Street Thinks Netflix Is Worth Now

Netflix had an incredible final quarter of 2024, and today the company — and its investors — are reaping the spoils. Shares in Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) skyrocketed $100 apiece on Tuesday afternoon following the release of the company’s fourth-quarter financials. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix revealed record growth of nearly 19 million subscribers, absolutely blowing away media analysts’ forecasts. Netflix revenue topped $10 billion, though its quarterly profit declined. No matter, there’s a fix for that: Netflix also announced price increases across each of its subscription plans. In turn, Netflix forecast better-than-previously-expected revenue growth for the current quarter, Q1 of 2025. Wall Street loves that stuff. Related Stories ‘The Night Agent’ Season 2 Finale: No Good Deed Goes Unpunished Every Mindy Kaling Production, Ranked How much? We can quantify that. When the stock exchanges opened this morning, NFLX shares nearly hit $1,000 apiece (instead settling for an all-time high of $999). Netflix’s market cap is now north of $400 billion; remember when Blockbuster Video passed on buying the company at $50 million? For some recent perspective on the surge in Netflix’s valuation, in fall 2021, before The Great Netflix Correction, shares appeared to be headed for $700. After reporting a shocking loss in subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, shares of NFLX dropped below $200. It’s been quite the comeback. And media analysts see no ceiling. Well, that’s not entirely correct — it’s more like they just vaulted the ceiling to the roofline. Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a research analyst for Bank of America and a regular interviewer on Netflix’s earnings “call” (Netflix for many years conducted a prerecorded video interview format and not a live call), already saw NFLX at being worth $1,000; now, she’s all the way up to $1,175. Jason Helstein of Oppenheimer raised his own target from $1,040 to $1,150. It’s a popular price target (PT): Tim Nollen from Macquarie is at the same number, up from $965. As is Alicia Reese of Wedbush, now $200 above her prior $950 target; John Hodulik of UBS is also at $1,150, up a whole $10 from his prior PT of $1,140. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI is up from $950 to $1,100. Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities is either nuts or a prophet — not to be confused with “profit,” which is what you would make if his investment advice comes true — hiking his price target all the way from $680 to $1,494. Somebody wake the boys at Deutsche Bank: Bryan Kraft, Spencer Amer, Benjamin Soff, and Victor-A Odiwuor are at $875 per share. They’re either late to the party or just slow-playing: DB’s prior NFLX PT was $650. With $1,000 clearly in sight, Netflix could be headed for its first stock split in a decade. While none of this (from us) should be considered investment advice, it does have my IndieWire 401k wondering: Where can I find a time machine back to the DVD days?

Trump said during a press conference Tuesday that a new company, dubbed the Stargate Project, will invest “at least” $500 billion in AI infrastructure for ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the next four years, such as data centers being built in the heart of Texas. Private-sector companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and the Japanese conglomerate Softbank are among Stargate’s initial equity investors, according to a joint press release. The company has also chosen Microsoft and Nvidia as technology partners. “This infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit[s] for the entire world,” Stargate said. To be clear, Tuesday’s announcement did not specifically mention the World project, formerly known as Worldcoin (the WLD token still bears that name). Launched by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2023, the eyeball-scanning project is constructing a digital identification platform that leverages biometric data and cryptography. Still, Worldcoin’s market cap jumped past $2.2 billion Wednesday, with AI-related projects also catching a bid from traders. Among the biggest gainers was Virtuals, a protocol for tokenized AI agents that saw its VIRTUAL token increase 20% in price to $3.06. AI agents will change the internet as we know it. Bring on the future 🫡 — World (@worldcoin) January 22, 2025 Though some traders believe that AI will fuel the next crypto revolution, the so-called “meta” built around AI agents and their associated meme coins appeared imperiled just recently, as the president’s newly launched meme coin took center stage and drained liquidity from other coins. But a crypto-friendly administration that’s also cheerleading investments in AI has traders excited as AI agents show signs of taking off, Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “The $500 billion could translate into investments that supercharge crypto and AI synergies, helping America become the dominant leader in these two critical technologies,” he said. The crypto trading firm Wintermute described Trump’s announcement Tuesday as “surprising,” pushing traders toward AI-related coins, such as Aixbt (AIXBT) and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), which encompasses Fetch.ai’s decentralized machine learning network. The excitement surrounding AI wasn’t limited to the cryptosphere, with Nvidia’s stock price rising 3.6% on the day to $146. Oracle’s stock was meanwhile up 6% Wednesday to $183.

Title: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age — or risk sinking into irrelevance. A series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker’s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%. Its board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs. The move laid bare the board’s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel’s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (that is, operating a foundry). “I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,” analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance. Since Gelsinger’s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML (ASML) CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley. A Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are "already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel." They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic. Intel declined to comment on its CEO search. Yahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel’s board might select to take the helm of America’s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer. The aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner “doesn't want the job.” Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner’s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, "has a shot." The former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill — a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader. “She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,” one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as “a proven general manager and leader.” Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while. “As someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,” Sag told Yahoo Finance. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel’s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo’s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen. Five of those “outsiders” previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich. The Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates. Sources have mixed opinions on whether Intel should hire an insider who knows the company well. "Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations," Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance. Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate “a lot of shareholders would love to see” fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel’s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel’s foundry strategy — a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is “well-respected” and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role. “Lip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,” the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance. Yet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization. One of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role. One of the five former Intel insiders reportedly under consideration for the CEO role is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as “strategically brilliant” and “execution-oriented.” However, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick. Stacy Smith — an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade — was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as “trusted, respected, well-liked.” Smith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba’s chip business — which was rebranded as Kioxia — as its executive chair. The completion of Kioxia’s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said. Former executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel’s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job. Intel hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to help with the search, Bloomberg reported. Wall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up “within the next couple of months,” writing that “the company is relatively far along in the process.” Meanwhile, KeyBanc’s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months. “The board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,” Vinh said. Last Friday, Intel’s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition, but its interest in such a deal cooled. Intel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors. Meanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg. But until a new CEO can be found, the chipmaking giant is at a standstill. “The interim CEOs … will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,” KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.

Title: Trump Signs RTO Order—What’s Happening To Remote Jobs In 2025?

Everytime you receive news that your job is on the line or you’re forced to leave your role due to ... [+] remote work policies, use it as an opportunity to try something new and reinvent yourself "We're moving in a new direction." "We're undergoing a restructure." "This is our year of efficiency." "We're headed in a different place right now." "The company is undergoing downsizing to reduce waste." How many times have you received a notice or email that included any of these lines? The anxiety creeps and your heart starts pounding because you already know what follows...you're fired. Or at least, you're on the chopping block and can expect your role to be eliminated at any moment. We've barely completed the first quarter of 2025, and already the workplace is experiencing major upheavals. BP is cutting 5% of its workforce as part of its "simplify and focus" plan, and joins companies like Meta and Bridgewater Associates, who announced plans to cut 5% and 7% of their headcount respectively. And to add to 2025's unfolding workplace drama, newly appointed President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday forcing all federal workers to cease working remotely, or they will be fired, with some exemptions being permissible. This news comes on the heels of Amazon's five-days-a-week RTO policy implementation as of January 1, according to Business Insider. Trump's executive order could potentially impact 1.1 million federal employees who are eligible to work remotely (out of the 2.28 million government workers)—228,000 of them who are already fully remote, based on figures from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s report to Congress in August 2024. The goal? To ultimately shrink the federal workforce in line with the goals of the newly-created government thinktank and temporary Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE, which is focused on slashing costs and expenditure of resources across government agencies by 2026. In fact, tech mogul Elon Musk who heads the operation, stated in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed alongside Vivek Ramaswamy that "requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," referring to the loophole in statutory civil-service protections that allows “reductions in force” that don’t target specific employees. "If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home," he said. The intent behind forcing eligible federal workers and current fully-remote government employees to work remotely five days a week comes as no surprise. Other major companies such as Amazon have been suspected of quiet firing in an effort to drive efficiency (quiet firing is the practice of creating hostile, demotivating, or other negative conditions at work that create a condition where employees voluntarily hand in their resignations, which reduces the need to go through the process and consultations associated with firing). A recent ResumeTemplates survey of 1,000 U.S. managers found that "45% of companies anticipate layoffs in 2025, with many citing economic concerns, AI automation, and the incoming Trump administration’s policies as influencing factors." Additionally, a recent Pew Research Center survey noted that nearly half (46%) of remote workers say they would readily leave their job if no longer permitted to work from home. Although of course, labor unions and others are using their rights to sue and push back against anti-remote work policies such as those advocated and enforced by Trump and his allies, the fact remains that incidents like these create hostility towards professionals who already work from home, and a culture of remote work being taboo. If you're a federal employee (or work at a company that's in the process of enforcing RTO mandates) and you work from home in a hybrid arrangement, or are 100% remote, here are a few steps you should take now so you can continue to work remotely and feel supported in your goals: Whenever quiet firing occurs, prioritize taking care of your mental health First, it's OK to feel enraged, slighted, and hurt after providing years of service to the same employer and consistently being a high performer, especially if you're a public servant. It's natural to feel shock and anxiety during moments like these. This is why it's critical now, more than ever before, to take care of your mental wellbeing and take time to breathe, and acknowledge and express your feelings. Find or create a support network. Take up a new hobby. Throw yourself into something healthy that will distract you from your current employment situation. Understand that it's fine to not have everything together in your life, and what you're feeling is likely what thousands of other workers are feeling right now. Whenever you hear about a "restructuring" or "flattening structures" within the workforce of your company, consider it a time for change—not just for them, but for you. If they can head in a new direction, so can you. It's time to shift your perspective and, although it's easier said than done, view it positively, because this is your chance to rediscover yourself. After all, you are the architect of your future. No one, not even an employer that you've held a decades-long commitment to, has the right or power to control your life and whether or not you achieve your career and financial goals. Sometimes, major negative events occur in our lives so that we can rethink the meaning of our existence. It gives us time to pause and reflect about whether we want to continue working in the same role, or whether it's time to try something new. Your challenge is to use this as an opportunity to reinvent yourself and try something new. Take time for your hobbies and try online personality tests and quizzes to understand your core values and passions. This can help you shift your focus from seeing your current employment situation as a negative thing, to actually viewing it as a catalyst for positive change in your life. This is because often, you won't progress in your career and fulfil your potential until you're uncomfortable with your work environment. Discomfort creates change. Next, it's time to dust off your resume and LinkedIn profile and update them. In fact, go ahead and give them a total overhaul. If you're serious about finding remote work, you need to be proactive about displaying the right skills in your resume—especially skills that are in high demand for most remote jobs, like roles in marketing, project management, and AI. Although you can use traditional sites like Indeed, Monster, and ZipRecruiter to find remote jobs, it's much easier to locate them through job boards that specialize in remote and flexible work such as FlexJobs, We Work Remotely, and Remote.co. Additionally, the start-up incubator Y Combinator has a job board on its website that is constantly being updated for remote jobs at start-ups. And of course, don't forget to reach out to your network and strategically build new connections. Freelancing is a viable and increasingly popular alternative to traditional employment. There are expected to be more than 86 million freelancers (half the U.S. workforce) by 2027, so why not use your skills to join them and make money? As a freelancer, you have more control over your hours and location of employment, so this is highly favorable for remote work, and you can start building your freelance business immediately. The success of your freelance business is in proportion to your expertise, marketing, and research, and will grow as fast as the hours and effort you put in. Freelancing is one of the easiest ways to find a remote job straight away Remote work and hybrid working isn't over in 2025. By following the advice in this article, you can continue to prioritize your wellbeing, spend time with loved ones, make more money, and cut the headache and costs of commuting as you embrace this new way to work.

Title: People are buying the wrong stock thinking it's part of OpenAI's Stargate Project

MGX stock is soaring Wednesday on the heels of the company’s involvement with OpenAI and SoftBank’s (SFTBY) new Stargate project. There’s just one minor problem — it’s the stock ticker for the wrong MGX. MGX represents shares of Metagenomi Inc., a biotechnology company focused on leveraging genome editing tools. Last week, the company said it is working on bringing its experimental treatment for hemophilia A to clinical trials in 2026. Investors were likely confused by a press release announcing that MGX would be among the initial equity funders in the Stargate Project, which seeks to invest $500 billion over the next four years in new artificial intelligence infrastructure for OpenAI. The MGX referenced there is a technology fund based in the United Arab Emirates. The likely misunderstanding propelled Metagenomi stock up by as much as 33% on Wednesday before gains were pared back down to a 25% increase. Shares are down 67% for the last 12 months and 24% over the last six months. As for Stargate, the project is expected to be a major boost to the U.S. economy and OpenAI, according to the people backing it. President Donald Trump, who was joined by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, and Oracle’s (ORCL) Larry Ellison at the White House — said it would generate more than 100,000 jobs. The group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. Although the backers plan to eventually spend $500 billion, the companies said they would deploy $100 billion “immediately.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. However, not everyone is fully on board with Stargate. Atreides Management Chief Investment Office Gavin Baker, who also noted the MGX mix-up, called the $500 billion “a ridiculous number” that “no one should take seriously” unless SoftBank sold their Arm and Alibaba (BABA) stock. “And I say all of this as someone who is really optimistic about AI in every way,” Baker added in a post on X. “Stargate is fiction wrapped around a much less impressive reality.” Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump’s with his own federal task force, agrees. In a series of posts late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday morning, Musk said he has it on “good authority” that SoftBank has less than $10 billion secured. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X, replying to an OpenAI post announcing Stargate. Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who left the startup and has a longstanding feud with Altman and the startup, also has his own AI company, xAI. His firm raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia chips.

Title: 'Elon and I hugged it out': Jamie Dimon says Elon Musk is 'our Einstein'

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon thinks Elon Musk is a modern-day Albert Einstein. “The guy is our Einstein,” Dimon said of Musk, the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO who has become a top ally to President Donald Trump. “I’d like to be helpful to him and his companies as much as we can.” Musk, the world’s richest person, now wields considerable power in the White House, after helping Trump secure a second term. Musk is tasked with heading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was initially pitched as a means of finding as much as $2 trillion in federal spending cuts, but which appears to have shifted its focus to updating software and reducing headcount. Dimon, in an interview with CNBC (CMCSA) at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said that he recently mended fences with Musk after JPMorgan dropped its $162 million lawsuit against the electric vehicle maker. “Elon and I hugged it out,” Dimon said. “He came to one of our conferences. He and I had a nice, long chat. We settled some of our differences.” In a suit filed against Tesla in 2021, JPMorgan alleged that the company breached a 2014 stock warrant deal after the bank lowered the exercise price. Under the contract, if Tesla stock traded above a certain price, it would owe JPMorgan money in either shares or cash. JPMorgan claimed the stock warrants became more valuable following a 2018 tweet by Musk in which he said he was considering taking the company private at a share price of $420, and that “funding [was] secured.” The post caused Tesla’s price to surge, before dipping weeks later after he said he wouldn’t follow through with the idea. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Musk with securities fraud in September 2018 over the tweets. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines to settle the charges. Tesla countersued in 2023, alleging that JPMorgan took advantage of the tweet to reduce the strike price of millions of warrants in an attempt to catch a windfall from the deal. JPMorgan dropped the lawsuit without prejudice last November.

If you wanted to characterize “the biggest trends in anime of the last decade,” you might be inclined to narrow in on anime's increasingly global presence or the exploding volume of new TV anime being produced. Maybe, if you follow the industry closely, you'd talk about how overseas finance has changed what anime gets made, a preference towards single cour releases, the decline of original anime not based on a pre-existing manga or novel, or the implications of home video collapsing as a pillar of anime monetization. But one trend that has been impossible to ignore, even amongst people who don't regularly watch anime, the rise of isekai. If you're entrenched in the anime fandom, it probably feels as though isekai has had a lock on the anime industry for a generation. While there have been anime that would qualify with some regularity going back to the '80s, the term only garnered widespread use in the last fifteen years, and its adoption into English-language fan spaces is even more recent. It was only last year that the loanword joined the Oxford English Dictionary, a full 14 years after “kawaii” and eight behind fellow genre-most-associated-with-anime, “mecha”. The English-language Wikipedia page on isekai is hardly older than Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Indeed, 2019 was the first year where more than 10 isekai series aired on Japanese airwaves. That would be but an auspicious allusion to what was to come. We are at peak isekai: the genre makes up 15% of 2024's new TV anime. The 34 isekai released last year may only represent a marginal 3% increase from the one prior, but over the last five, the volume of new titles with characters whisked away to another world has grown 143%. To highlight how profound that growth is: more than half of all isekai in the medium's history have been released since 2020. The most important takeaway is not necessarily the genre's dramatic increase in production, but how isekai seems to have leveled off, holding steady at around 15% of new anime produced. Viewership behavior suggests we have not hit our point of diminishing returns with the genre and that the demand side could bear even more isekai than we're getting now. The community consensus seems to be that there's already too much isekai being made, but when we discuss viewership data later, we'll explore how fan behavior doesn't reflect that notion. One may be tempted to look at this chart and see the timing of isekai's boom as correlative with the COVID-19 pandemic, to assume that part of the genre's growth is tied to increased demand for fantasy and comfort food during a time when many were isolated or locked down. While it conceptually makes sense, I'd be skeptical of the importance of lockdowns for two reasons. First, this chart largely captures the supply side of the isekai game. Anime production is a slow process, and typically takes a few years between a production committee assembling and any actual production taking place. Second, while the international anime community saw its ranks multiply during this period, isekai did not experience disproportionate growth. If anything, I'd be surprised to see fewer fans of the genre proportionately, even if the raw number of card-carrying isekai lifers has blossomed. It's true that international sales now represent a majority of revenue in the anime industry, but production plans for this quantity of isekai were already penciled in before that was the case. As for the chart methodology, what qualifies as “another world” or not depends on who you ask. For our purposes, an isekai anime is either 1) anime that has been categorized as isekai by their publishers, 2) anime that explicitly uses phrases like “isekai” or “in another world” as part of their titles and synopses, or 3) anime I judged as clear “reverse isekai” stories, where a character from another world is trapped in the real world, such as The Devil Is a Part-Timer! or Otaku Elf. I'm very much evaluating whether or not an anime embodies the spirit of isekai in the popular imagination but even if one accounts for any quibbles in definitions here, the direction laid out by the analysis holds strong. A final observation about the chart is that isekai's growth is similar to John Green's notion about falling asleep and/or falling in love: it happens slowly and then all at once. The genre's dominance was a long time coming, and one only has to look at the history of the genre in anime to see how. While much can be said about isekai in Japan, today we'll be examining the state of isekai from a primarily Western perspective, with a focus on English-speaking territories. In Japanese, isekai more literally reads as “different world” or “another world”, but the implication and common use in English is as a subgenre where the protagonist finds themselves in another world, typically one more fantastical than their own. While this concept is found in folklore from around the world, the genre's roots in popular fiction like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court lay a common groundwork for how isekai is approached today. While there are still some Western works of fiction that would reasonably be considered isekai, over the last 30 years, isekai has become a staple of anime, manga, and novels from Japan. Until recently, almost all of its growth has come from the popularity of media from that country. The mastermind behind Mobile Suit Gundam, Yoshiyuki Tomino, released the great Aura Battler Dunbine in 1983. It's considered the first isekai anime by many due to its commonalities with the genre today, despite a handful of contenders for that designation with earlier release dates, including an anime adaptation of the Wizard of Oz that hit cinemas the year prior. The 49 (thoroughly excellent) episodes of Dunbine locked in many of the tropes that would become most commonly associated with isekai going forward and served as an inspiration for many of its successors in the genre. Popular anime like The Vision of Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Digimon, and .hack//SIGN are all clear examples of “in another world” stories released in the years between Aura Battler Dunbine and the modern era of isekai. While they may have been described with the term in Japan and occasionally compared to one another, the term was not used as a category until the Japanese web novel platform Shōsetsuka ni Narō grew an audience in the late 00s in parallel with one of its more popular subjects for fanfiction, The Familiar of Zero. The excellent Kim Morrissy covered this topic quite comprehensively for ANN a few years back if you'd like to dig into the history more. It wasn't until 2012 with Sword Art Online that English-speaking netizens began using the phrase. According to SAO author Reki Kawahara in comments on Twitter (formally known as X), this is a misuse of the term, saying “SAO is set in the real world!” Sword Art Online became one of the first mega-hits of the streaming era. Accurate or not, this association immediately provided awareness to many overseas fans. To give something a name gives it power, and as is often the case with international anime audiences, having a Japanese name for the category elevated the allure even further, and made those “in the know” feel like insiders. Equipped with “isekai,” fans worldwide began to recognize the genre's relevance with ever-increasing aptitude, perhaps disproportionately so considering how rare isekai anime were during this period. And so isekai grew. Comparing the two above charts—the Google Trends journey of the word “isekai” and the release cadence of new isekai anime—reveals the impact of popular series like Overlord, Re:Zero, and KONOSUBA in the mid-2010s: there wasn't enough supply to meet demand suggested by the interest by 2017-2018. Anime most frequently takes 3-4 years between greenlight and release. It's as though you can see dozens of producers scrambling in parallel to get their company's response to Re:Zero onto the desks of animators with the way the charts dance up and to the right. Is isekai the most popular genre of anime? In a word, yes. For illustration, I've put together some analysis of all TV anime that broadcast in Japan in 2024. Popularity was determined by the same formula employed in the series of articles where I compare what's being watched in the U.S. compared to Japan expanded to also include several other countries where English is the most-spoken language: Canada, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. By using data scraped from a dozen pirate sites, estimates for legal sites from all available data, and other proxies for viewership, after weighing each metric based on geographic distributions and a quality rating (based on Nate Silver's “pollster ratings” to prioritize metrics that have been demonstrably predictive of viewership in the past), you can make a fairly robust relative popularity scale. For the year 2024, the “top anime” of the year was a competitively ranked trio: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Hashira Training Arc, Solo Leveling, and DAN DA DAN. All other titles were rated out of 100 compared to the “big three,” if you will. If you then average out the ratings per genre, you get the following chart: What you see here is that isekai is number two…but only slightly, despite the action genre being home to all ten of the most-performant anime of 2024. While most anime fall into multiple genres in this analysis, “isekai” is wholly unrepresented in the top ten anime of the year, first showing up at the #11 spot. So, how is isekai so close to action in the ratings? Action is one of the biggest cohorts in our analysis, including nearly half of the year's TV series within its large tent. As such, it's reasonable to assume plenty of lower-quality action series dragging down the average, and you'd be right to. However, the biggest determinant of isekai's success is its consistency. I could make a lot of sports analogies for isekai here, but I'm going to do it in a way that makes sense to me: through the film Moneyball. It's based on the somewhat true story of a baseball general manager who employs quantitative analysis to transform the sport into a giant optimization problem, allowing the (then) Oakland-based Athletics to hire a roster of players who drastically overperform relative to their price and move up in the league's standings. While it's overly simplified for the movie (and arguably, overstated), the key metric the A's team seeks is a player's ability to first base. The heart of the concept is that if you can just get more players on-base, on average, you'll end up with more runs than a team with a lower on-base percentage. And that's what isekai does; it gets on-base. When we analyze anime ratings, we split them into four equal groups called quartiles. The light blue bar shows the middle two quartiles, representing the popularity of the median 50% of each genre. Looking at these ranges, isekai is far ahead, with the highest first and third quartile. Even the comparatively weak isekai—those at the 25th percentile—are comparable to the average performance from nearly every other genre. This is also to say that close to 75% of isekai are more popular than the average comedy or romance. This is the real value of isekai: it's hard to make a flop in another world. Anime distributors and publishers tend to use letter grades to denote the “level” of an anime, usually in terms of its revenue potential. As such, for an anime to be graded an “S” means it's anticipated to be an all-timer, in the top 5-10% of all series, an anime that will generate huge streaming audiences and many secondary streams of income. Isekai may be a reliable hitmaker, but it has a really hard time breaking into the “S” category. When you looked at the chart above, the first thing you may have noticed was, on a 100-point scale, how low the average anime was. The average “popularity score” for all 2024 TV anime was 10.1, with the median sitting just over a value of 5. The trio of top titles mentioned had just as much estimated viewership and interest in them as the bottom 120 combined. This kind of “feast or famine” distribution is fairly normal in media, but that doesn't make it any less hard as a consumer to conceptualize how big the gap is between a Solo Leveling and a Girls Band Cry is, particularly when they sit side-by-side on Crunchyroll and are discussed at similar rates on social media. As mentioned above, the top isekai anime of the year sits at rank #11 for the year: Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation. But with a popularity rating of just 33% that of Demon Slayer, is it fair to call it an “S”-level title? It's watched by a ton of people, yes, but is that all it takes to make an Attack on Titan-level hit? In English-speaking countries, it's not a top-seller for home video. The light novels haven't made the BookScan charts. The anime's licensee Crunchyroll isn't selling much branded apparel (though sublicense Ripple Junction has a dozen SKUs currently active), nor have there been any collaborations for other categories of licensed merchandise. This is the case for most isekai titles. Popular ones like Re:Zero and KONOSUBA fare a bit better in the specific verticals mentioned above, but generally speaking, isekai anime are less likely to see their rights exploited outside of streaming compared to similarly viewed shows. The factors behind this “always the bridesmaid, never the bride” situation can best be examined by understanding exactly who is watching isekai. What kind of person watches isekai? To answer this question, the best place to go is to the people who watch isekai. As part of White Box Entertainment's research for publishers, my team and I regularly survey self-identified anime fans in select English-speaking countries (the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa), and that gives us a good place to start looking at what the demographics and behaviors of this group are compared to anime fans at large: Considering a large percentage of the anime community watches isekai, it's impressive that this profile tells you anything about isekai fans, but the trends align with observed fan behavior to highlight key differences. Isekai fans, in short, watch more anime and have been watching anime for longer. There are slightly more males than the fandom at large, but only slightly (English-speaking countries are the only territories with a noticeable gender gap in viewership). Non-binary fans are proportionately less likely to watch isekai. We see parallels between merchandise and fandom activities: isekai fans are 22% less likely to listen to anime soundtracks or purchase any anime merchandise. There are many challenges with this kind of analysis, though. First, it's self-reported. People who fill out surveys have the distinct characteristic of being willing to fill out surveys, and while my team and I work hard to address that, it's a limitation for sure. Secondly, we can only be so thorough. For many traits, interests, and behaviors, isekai fans were essentially the same as the audience at large. One of those that was particularly interesting to me was the stated propensity to discuss anime online on social media: people watching at least a single isekai anime this season as well as self-identified isekai fans alike both said they discussed anime on social on the regular — at a higher rate than the broader survey sample! This stood out because, in my research, isekai is the genre with the lowest social media volume in English, particularly compared to viewership. Again, as with merchandise, there are certainly outliers, but one would hardly know The Most Notorious "Talker" Runs the World's Greatest Clan is one of the most-watched anime of the Fall in the US by browsing BlueSky, nor is it represented as well as similarly-viewed series in the English fanfiction, fanart, or cosplay spaces. The takeaway? People love to watch isekai, but when they engage in fandom activities, they're more likely to engage regarding a different anime they're keeping up with. The depth of their interest in isekai runs a bit more shallow. However, there's another complicating factor that plays a role in the decreased interest in fandom surrounding isekai anime: the backlash towards the genre in the community. You don't have to spend much time talking with anime fans to hear complaints about the volume of “isekai slop” and it's hard to blame long-time viewers in particular for their perspective: the quantity of new isekai hitting Japanese airwaves in any given week since 2022 is around the same number as the entire late-night anime roster combined as recently as 15 years ago. It begs the question, should isekai take up 15% of the TV anime scene? It's been almost two years since Steve Jones & Nicholas Dupree wrote “we've truly reached the bottom of the barrel” regarding isekai. It's been five years since Geoff Thew released a video called “Too Much Isekai” — and that was during a year with less than half of 2024's volume! These are far from the only content creators and editorial teams to feel this way, and it's reflected in the fandoms across political borders and languages. As we discussed earlier, isekai draws in viewers with a consistency not even “shonen action” can compete with. And compared to other forms of visual media with similar audience sizes, anime is extremely cheap to produce. If we wanted to make a perfectly economically efficient distribution for what the anime industry as a whole should produce, we would need more isekai, at least until its middle 50% of titles stopped performing so far above other genres. That said, not all popularity is equal. We're talking about art here, and there's a reason that so many of us have moments from anime first encountered decades ago that still resonate with us now. This emotional impact has business ramifications as well. Anime that can affect a broader audience has a broader reach, something that's of particular interest to the biggest purveyors of the medium in the Western world like Crunchyroll and Netflix. The challenging thing is trying to measure the qualitative reaction to anime. We've already explored how isekai anime, while generally strong performers are rarely considered “anime of the year” material by viewership. The same behavior is seen in the eyes of critics and fans. Since its inception in 2017, only two isekai have been nominated for the Crunchyroll Anime Award's top category, Re:Zero and Sonny Boy, the latter of which wholly ignores most conventions and tropes popular in the genre. Isekai is nowhere to be found in Anime News Network's Best Anime of 2024 list, and to find a representative of another world in the annual AOTY mega-poll results from ANN's readers, you'd have to go back to 2021. Whether it's on MyAnimeList, Crunchyroll, or IMdB, isekai ratings are virtually indistinguishable from other genres on average. I typically don't put stock in these sorts of user ratings, but isekai anime tends not to get enough critical reception to make it onto the likes of similarly misleading aggregators like Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes that are used as barometer of reception in polite company. As a result, I took the time to crank out MyAnimeList's ratings for isekai compared to other genres since the spike in 2019. The results can be found here: To start a list of important qualifications, according to my survey data and SimilarWeb, MyAnimeList skews male significantly more than most other anime websites. This is compounded by the fact that the users most likely to leave a rating are even more male and younger. People who use MyAnimeList are more likely to be deeply enfranchised compared to the anime audience as a whole. Additionally, most people will not leave a review for an anime they have no interest in even starting, and isekai are typically loud and obvious as to their nature, thus removing those who find them unpleasant as a rule from even giving them enough of a chance to leave a “3/10 dropped” from the calculation entirely. You can understand with all these issues with the data—as well as the novel's worth more I'm holding back for everyone's sake—that I don't take any platform's user ratings all too seriously in evaluating reception, even one as popular as MAL. That said, once we take this chart with a bucket of sand, the trend we saw with popularity is represented once again: isekai is generally received fairly well. Titles like Re:Zero and Mushoku Tensei have demonstrated that the genre's best are evaluated by the anime community without their genre being held against them, and titles like Sonny Boy and Ascendance of a Bookworm represent isekai's ability to cater to a more critically-inclined crowd. Breaking out the subgenres within isekai reveals how much the “cheat” sub-category drags down the rest. As you'll see from the analysis, I think there's a great case for cheat isekai's importance, but it's not as easily defined as something like a “reincarnation” isekai. A cheat isekai, to me, is a series where the protagonist has a disproportionate power-level advantage beyond the skills or knowledge they bring from another world. One of the loudest critiques of isekai characterizes the genre as power fantasies for those dissatisfied with their station, replete with wish fulfillment of every flavor. I find this to be a bit too broad of a brush, even when centering on the “cheat” subgenre that most closely aligns with the stereotype. But cheat isekai only represent 11% of the genre's output in recent years, and, perhaps more importantly in understanding why they're so visible, they're amongst the most watched. Using the same methodology for 2024 anime as above for the sub-genres, we find the average popularity of isekai TV anime as follows: This one requires a caveat as well if a smaller one. Many of these sub-genres or genre cross-overs are quite small; “villainess,” “slice of life,” and “transformation” are only represented by a pair of titles each for 2024. These trends are consistent enough over the years but as with the above chart, I'd encourage you to not treat it as gospel. That said, sub-genre performance only further demonstrates the power of isekai. All but two of isekai's particular classifications beat out drama, romance, and sports anime on average, and isekai crossover genres outperform equivalent non-isekai categories as well. For example, slice of life that's also isekai are 55% more popular on average than your standard iyashikei. I would not have anticipated romance as a category that benefits from a cross-genre with isekai, but the data show just that. You may also notice another trend comparing the two charts about isekai's subgenres, one that's represented across all media: critical evaluations seem to be negatively correlated with popularity. That is to say, the most popular isekai subgenres are the least well-regarded, and the most positively reviewed don't necessarily see much in the way of viewership. Such is the way it goes! Even though “reincarnation” is a consistent winner with viewers, since it represents such a significant share of all isekai, it's hard to parse out anything meaningful about whether the reincarnation element is an important quality to either viewers or critics. Transformation anime performs quite well, but much of this can be attributed to how strict I was in my definition. For classifying subgenres, I tried my best to aggregate tags and metadata across multiple platforms, but in the end, I had to rely on my own experience with these titles. For "transformation" I felt the category was compelling enough to crunch the numbers on, as many consider it a core element to many anime in the genre. However, “transformation” is a bit too broad of a topic. If we're to get metaphysical, almost any isekai contains a transformation of the protagonist(s), especially those involving reincarnation. In the end, after a strenuous debate with other isekai experts, I landed on the concept that an anime where the protagonist is no longer human would be the deciding line. Anything less drastic would lead to too many case-by-case subjective considerations and would, like with reincarnation, muddy the results. Thus, for 2024, the success of transformation isekai was all but certain. It's mostly due to two heavy-hitting franchises that have had regular seasons: That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and Overlord. Aside from “cheat” isekai, most subgenres have grown at the same rate as isekai, their proportion of new anime produced staying more or less flat year-to-year. One subgenre where there's been a slight uptick in production as well as cause for extra attention is villainess isekai. While the title “otome isekai” is perhaps both more accurate and is used by many of the subgenre's most ardent adherents, it's known colloquially as “villainess” due to both the term's ubiquity in titles and its resonance with English-speaking audiences. Otome games are visual novels or otherwise story-driven games with a female target audience that focus on romance, often with a reverse-harem framing or opportunities to enjoy handsome gentlemen interacting with one another. In many, a villainess character is prominent: she is your primary adversary, your rival in love. And for many isekai anime aimed at the otome game audience, our protagonist finds themselves in the role not of the hero, but of the villainess! The subgenre's most well-known example is 2019's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, wherein the protagonist is magically trapped in the world of her favorite otome game in the villainess role. Besides being quite popular with its intended audience, My Next Life as a Villainess was something of a crossover hit, and became one of the year's more popular new titles, receiving not only a second season, but a film as well. Relative to other anime of similar popularity, isekai franchises tend to get fewer theatrical excursions than their contemporaries, so the fact that Catarina Claes's exploits made it to the big screen before Ains Ooal Gown is particularly notable. In the years since, there have been a handful of anime adaptations with similar concepts. Where this trend is even more noticeable in the world of Japanese web novels and light novels from which almost all isekai anime are adapted. Like isekai itself, villainess anime in the six years since My Next Life as a Villainess has performed consistently in both the West and in their native Japan, making the category attractive for producers looking to minimize risk. Already, we have anime adaptations for The Old Man Reincarnated As A Villainess, The Holy Grail of Eris, and The Dark History of the Reincarnated Villainess planned for this year or soon thereafter, but that's only considering anime based on Japanese works. South Korean manhwa/webcomics have had some of their biggest successes in the world of isekai, with villainess titles taking a more central position on trending lists on webtoon sites than their contemporaries in manga and Japanese light novels. With the increased interest in South Korean comics as source material for anime in recent years, including the mega-popular Solo Leveling and, in particular, the villainess isekai Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke's Mansion, I believe we'll see the continued growth of otome-styled isekai anime in the years ahead. The volume of new TV isekai seems to be in a steady state, if not growing ever slightly. It's one of anime's most popular genres and has become an iconic one, representative of many of everything the medium can offer. Like their Japanese counterparts, international audiences seem incredibly receptive to watching the majority of the isekai series released, even if they're not as keen on building a fandom around them. Similarly to the anime that adapt them, isekai manga and light novels may not be at the top of the charts, but many franchises are solid perennial sellers. Digging into sales numbers from Oricon, it's rare to see an isekai franchise in any manga top 10, but for everything concerning light novels, the genre is ever-present. I haven't seen any meta trends either in Japan or overseas that there's any kind of shift away from isekai in readership, and I see no reason to doubt that the supply of source material for more anime can sustain the current rate of adaptations. Which brings us to the future. As The New York Times reported last year, nearly every anime studio was booked for years out, and that issue hasn't changed since. The anime currently in production or penciled in with studios aren't necessarily locked in, but shifting what's already queued works against the risk-averse philosophies of most publishers. Earlier, I noted how the “sudden” spike in anime production was essentially on a 3 to 4-year delay from when the genre started to deliver outsized results around the globe. Similarly, we'd need to see a significant downside in the financials related to producing isekai anime for the trend to reverse, and even then, there'd be a years-long gap to be meaningfully felt. To be clear, the opposite is happening. Isekai is a low-risk, high-reward genre for anime producers, just as much now during peak isekai as it ever was. Even a poorly performing isekai delivers outsized results compared to any other genre, almost as if the label is a “one weird trick” for producers. It was a technique that likely brought about WarnerMedia's Suicide Squad ISEKAI, an anime with a conceit that was so compelling that it spent 16 days on Max's top 10 in the United States last year, suggesting viewership in the millions in America alone. Isekai is not just continuing to get produced at incredible rates: it's getting preferential treatment in 2025. Crunchyroll typically dubs 15-20 simulcasts in a season, but with more than double that in terms of new anime, Big Orange needs to prioritize. Tellingly, nearly every isekai premiering this month is on the list of Q1 dubs, with isekai representing more than 40% of Crunchyroll's dub output. For 2025 and into the future, isekai is a core part of the popular conception of anime. While I don't think we'll see an isekai reach the level of mega-hits like Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer, the anime industry can hardly be faulted for investing so heavily in the genre when it's continued to find such consistent success with little indication of flagging. Isekai seems resilient to negative sentiment in the community, and audiences have shown a consistent interest in new IP based on the genre alone. The state of isekai is strong, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. Feature homepage / archives

Title: Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion 'Stargate' deal between OpenAI and SoftBank — and backed by Trump

Time Published: 2025-01-22T13:22:00Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk is already casting doubt on OpenAI’s new, up to $500 billion investment deal with SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL), despite backing from his allies — including President Donald Trump. The companies are teaming up for what they call the “Stargate Project,” presumably named after the sci-fi franchise, which aims to spend $500 billion over the next four years building artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. The companies said Tuesday that they would begin deploying $100 billion “immediately,” which will “generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.” As the deal was announced Tuesday in the White House, Trump — standing alongside Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — said the group would create a “new American company” that would generate more than 100,000 U.S. jobs. Ellison said the group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. There’s just one problem with Stargate, according to Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who has since sued to block it and Altman’s plans: They don’t have the cash. “They don’t actually have the money,” the Tesla (TSLA) CEO and close Trump ally said shortly before midnight on Tuesday, in a post on his social media site X. “SoftBank has well under $10 [billion] secured. I have that on good authority,” Musk added just before 1 a.m. ET. His comments marked a rare split between the world’s richest man and Trump, who took office on Monday. Musk was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers during the 2024 presidential campaign and has been given his own task force, nicknamed DOGE, and staff. The Trump administration is already facing at least four lawsuits over DOGE. Musk’s remarks also show that, despite Altman and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos’ comments last month, Musk isn’t content to sit by as his rivals profit from the new Trump administration. Altman said in December that he believes “pretty strongly that Elon would do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power” against business rivals. Besides Musk’s long-standing feud with Altman and litigation, he also founded an AI startup, xAI, to compete with OpenAI and other firms. xAI last month raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, less than two years after he founded the company. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia (NVDA) chips. xAI also works closely with Musk’s X. His social media platform, formerly Twitter, employs Grok, a chatbot developed by his xAI startup. Ellison is an investor in X, formerly served on Tesla’s board, and the pair of billionaires have a longtime friendship. “[I] genuinely respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time,” Altman said Wednesday in reply to Musk’s accusations. Altman followed up by saying that Musk’s allegations are “wrong, as you surely know,” before inviting him to visit the site in Texas. “[T]his is great for the country,” Altman said. “[I] realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role [I] hope you’ll mostly put [America] first.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC on Wednesday that “I’m good for my $80 billion. I’m going to spend $80 billion building out Azure.” The initial $100 billion comes from a number of sources, including equity from the founding partners and co-investors, as well as third-party debt, according to a source familiar with the matter. Additional investors are expected to be brought on and help fund the project over its lifetime. “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI—for the benefit of all of humanity,” OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement. “We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Dividend Alchemy: Unbundling Microsoft’s Equity With Blockchain
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/22/dividend-alchemy-unbundling-microsofts-equity-with-blockchain/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Permuto Capital management team In perhaps one of the very first instances of blockchain solving a real-world problem, and a little financial alchemy through the creation of additional value through the transformation of a standard financial asset, Permuto Capital has created the next big thing for equity investors. Permuto Capital is launching a product to unbundle the dividend and capital components of common stock and by appealing to different investor groups the sum value of the two elements may be greater than the value of the underlying stock. Permuto filed a registration statement with the SEC, and upon approval, expects to launch with Microsoft (MSFT) as their first equity. Separation of the economic components of financial instruments is not in itself a new idea. In the 1980s the government permitted coupon stripping of U.S. Treasury securities (notes and bonds), a process where the interest and principal components are partitioned into discrete securities and are termed “STRIPS” (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). The components appeal to different segments of investors, and the product thereby improves the efficiency of the overall market. Similar in concept to Treasury stripping, the Permuto product cleaves a Microsoft common share into two: a “dividend certificate” and an “appreciation certificate.” The owner of the dividend certificate will be entitled to the dividends paid by Microsoft on the common share, and the appreciation certificate will represent entitlement to everything else. The “secret sauce” for Permuto that makes their product viable whereas previous incarnations were considered too cumbersome and expensive for widespread distribution is twofold: the advantages of blockchain technology coupled with the use of single stock voting trusts to hold the shares and issue the certificates. The Voting Trust structure provides a regulatory compliant structure, and the blockchain reduces costs. The idea is that investors that hold Microsoft common shares may deposit the shares with a designated custodian, and in return the investor receives one of each of the two certificates. Once the certificates are created, they will trade independently, and hence the investor that deposited the shares may sell one, or both, of the certificates, and other investors may purchase certificates without having owned the underlying shares. An investor who owns both types of certificates may return them to the trust and receive back a common share. For an investor who wishes to use traditional platforms Permuto is seeking to have both types of certificates listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange, and the investor may elect for the Depository Trust Company (DTC) to hold their certificates. Alternatively, investors may choose to hold their certificates on the Chia blockchain as Chia Asset Tokens (CATs). One advantage of the CATs is that they will be able to be traded on decentralized marketplaces 24 hours a day, every day, and not be subject to exchange trading halts. The key advantage of the blockchain technology is cost savings. In addition to the reduction in trading fees from decentralized marketplaces when compared to traditional stock exchanges, the blockchain provides a cost-efficient mechanism for distribution of the dividend payments. Permuto charges for the processing of dividend payments, and there is a nominal fee for the creation or redemption of the certificates. When dividend certificates are held at the DTC Permuto pays the investor 80% of the dividend and retains 20% for processing costs. Better yet, given that costs are significantly lower on the Chia blockchain, an investor holding a CAT will receive 90% of the dividend payments. This difference implies that the dividend certificate should trade for a higher price as a CAT than on the traditional markets. If the assumptions are simplified a quick valuation may be calculated. Using a Microsoft share price of $429 and an annual dividend of $3.32, and assuming that the dividend increases 5% per year of which 90% is returned to the investor, the investor in the dividend certificate will receive $198.50 over thirty years. That is not the price that investor will pay today, however, as money has a greater value today than if received some point in the future. By assuming that money is worth 8% less per year, that dividend certificate will have a value of $45.46. A dividend certificate with that value returns an annual yield of 6.6%. The appreciation certificate should therefore have the value of $429 - $45.46 = $383.23. This simple calculation demonstrates how an investor may value the two elements of the common share. The benefit to investors is that they may allocate their investment capital directly according to their investment preferences, and may receive a string of dividend payments or no dividend payments and only the capital appreciation of the shares. According to Trent Martensen, Co-CEO Permuto Capital, “The ability to choose and manipulate risk exposure assuming a given return requirement is an objective for all investors, and by partitioning common shares into dividends and capital appreciation we are providing investors tools to fine tune their portfolios.” In finance grad school in the late 1980s and early 1990s discussions about financial engineering and structuring of risks often included dividends and how a given dividend stream may not be well priced for a given common stock. Only now are the tools available to deliver standardized products to investors, and Permuto certificates could be the answer to those questions from long ago. One Community. Many Voices.

But a stray thought popped up in my mind. Trump wants to take an axe to the Federal government, right? So I wondered if Trump was thinking about privatizing the CDC, the FDA and the NIH in his second term. I’m sure that the health care corporations would like to buy them up and run them the way that they should be. Don’t they already recieve more than 50 percent of their budgets from private companies? Seems like that would be more honest On the other hand, those government labs spend billions to develop new drugs which are then handed over to Big Pharma corporations who work out the dosage and then slap their patent on it. Can you imagine if it was the US government slapping their own patents on those new drugs and funneling back the profits for new research? I can! This is the US government shutting down public access to public information. Expect anything unfiltered that’s related to energy, climate, environment, health, to go dark soon, along with any potentially embarrassing open-ended data services like FRED. Privatization comes later, once DOGE is up and running. If you have any favorite public data sets, download them now. We’re going to need them. As a physician, I have been used to looking at these datasets for decades. Reports, MMWR, etc. At no time in our history until the Biden Admin was there suppression of data. The Biden Administration literally seemed to live to do that. Even during the dark days of the AIDS epidemic, there was no restriction in the free flow of information. Please note, it took months to compile – so there was quite a delay and that is understandable and that is not what I am talking about. The free flow of information continued through COVID during the Trump years. And then once the vaccines came out and there started to be “issues, the adults that were put back in charge with Biden – suddenly caused all kinds of data flows to come to an end. The US govt did shut down public access to health information – this was started under Biden – and I have never seen anything like it in my life. As to downloading public data sets, hope you are looking for something anodyne and non-problematic. All of the other stuff is long gone – and when you do download something – it is not really anything that you can use to make any kind of judgements. As I have stated from the being – release every scrap of raw data down to the finest details – just like we have done for a long time. No one is listening. My wife and I were discussing decreasing access to data (again) this morning. Pretty glum about the current state of affairs. Trying to find some glimmer of hope, I would hope RFK jr understands the value of having data in the public domain. My worry is that, in addition to being damning to Pfizer in that specific case, generally speaking, public health data has monetary value. There’s a fog of war element to these opening days of the 47th. The state data on SARS infections went dark in the west coast states in May of 2023. The governors of WA, OR, and CA marched in lockstep during the early pandemic. I don’t know if it’s my inexperience with the system, but I have not been able to find overall mortality data for the US 2015-2019 plus 2020 on from the CDC site. I’d like to make my own excess analysis. On the other hand, this certainly doesn’t help the situation any, either. Like with other issues, Trump is doing the same thing as the Democrats, only louder. This kind of situation is what makes me believe the binary political parties are no solution for the problems we face. Looks like the Chinese are doing AI right. How much longer before BRICS nations figure out that copyright law keeps people from using personal computers like Star Trek replicators? It’s past time to legally and Constitutionally clarify the legality of making digital copies. Western capitalism has failed in every respect, giving BRICS an easy way to blow up Hollywood™©®’s absurdly punitive civil damages laws. Never forget that Congress passed a law allowing music downloaders to be sued for up to $20,000US per song or about a quarter of a million dollars per record album. The vast majority of new music is created, edited and released on equipment that costs well under $20,000. How does this make sense? Copyright is governed on the country-by-country basis. Length in majority of countries is 50 years and in many of them civil damages are negligible to a point where there is zero enforcement. Insane penalties and over-the-top enforcement are mostly restricted to US, Canada and Europe, mostly due to trade treaties signed with US. Insane copyright protection was one of the pillars of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and was one of the reasons it failed. Sorry but that’s not correct. Copyright is governed under the Berne and Rome Conventions and the WIPO copyright treaty. Member countries transpose the treaties into their law, but agree to respect minimum protection. Most all countries are members. The term is usually either 50 or 70 years plus the life of the author. I started my legal career in IP and I’d recommend that you read a little more about it if you’re interested. It’s a fascinating subject and there are lots and lots of arguments about length, fair use, right to private copies, moral rights, neighboring rights (my old specialty, dear to my heart) and other somewhat arcane stuff. Imho, artists, composers and authors deserve some legal monopoly over their works for a limited period of time. Software got jammed into copyright by idiots. I’m done. Software got jammed into copyright by idiots. When I read this I stood up and applauded, tears running down my cheeks. Thanks. It’s my passionate belief as well. Can you believe that Microsoft Windows 3.0, released in 1990, will only be in the public domain in 2085? (95 years after published date for works for hire) Being a legal non-expert: This issue is of paramount importance nobody addresses adequately in public. As I see it, copyright only is an inadequate remedy in a capitalist system. Besides personal vanity for most artists and inventors IP regulation is (was) a means to make a living. If state services were free, apartments free, basic income guaranteed and all the other idealist concepts were to be realized (not in our lifetime) copyright would need not be. “Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants” for me always meant that the giants themselves were consisting of dwarfs. Meaning we all are dwarfs. Which would sum up the creation and expansion of human knowledge and creative output over millennia. “Piracy the obvious choice” is the thing Cory Doctorow used to talk about before deciding to be social activist. If we want to go to war over our IP with what kind of aircraft carrier will we defend it? A trade war with China may mean they will once again revert to copying, er, pirating all our movies and software. And in the process they are developing the skills to not need our IP. It’s likely that when it comes to both China and Russia Trump doesn’t really realize what he is dealing with. US soft power is evaporating leaving only the hopefully empty military threats. DJT needs to stick to picking on Greenland. Or maybe he does realize all this and is just posturing. And it’s not like his predecessor seemed to realize either. Interesting times. He still does. I think it’s been previously linked here, but that was the gist of his recent rant re Trump’s tarrif threat. https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham Makes sense, it’s the kind of asymmetric warfare that would quickly sharpen C-suite attention south of the border, much more than retaliatory tariffs, which only increase profits along with consumer prices. To bad our oligarchy is in bed with their oligarchy and it’ll never happen. I definitely like it. “Piracy, the obvious choice” These are a very important series of comments: important for development countries but critically important for the developing. Important for understand equity in all countries. When I was in Hanoi, Vietnam a couple of years ago there were motorcycles everywhere and I thought the Japanese were dominant even with expensive cycles. Finally, I noticed that I was not seeing so many Hondas but “Honkas.” Honkas—love it There is not a lot of data on this topic, but outside the u.s. and europe most university students rely on piracy to acquire textbooks. Ironically, this means that they have access to a much broader selection of books than their 1st world counterparts. My US college student does that too, please. I told her it ain’t what you steal, but who you steal it from My Canadian university students get their textbooks from “Uncle Vlad”. Soft power at its most powerful… Just look at Elsevier which is a rip-off of epic proportions. On the other hand in German university libraries where non-staff can have easy access too De Gruyter e.g. offers most studies as open access. >Trump announces an up to $500 billion AI infrastructure investment involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Business Insider OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son attended the White House announcement. Would that be the same “Sam Altman” that Suchir Balaji, who was a whistleblower that mysteriously committed one of the most improbable suicides I’ve ever heard about, worked for? Larry Ellison, would that be the pro-Israel zionist who donated $17M to IDF recently? My Twitter feed is lite up with people who were very dubious of the rushed mRNA technology used for CV19 chiming in on what a Trump sell-out this is. David Icke is actually starting to make sense to some, these oligarchs are reptiles, reptilian at the very least. Going from transgender to transhuman? 500 Billion dollars, that would go a long way to help some desperate people drowning under pile of hospital bill debts, local clinics, etc… that would go a long way to ease the servitude of millions of young people struggling to make monthly payments on student loans. It’s also very interesting that this is being sold as a personalized openAI solution for fighting cancer. No wonder all those tech billionaries who loathed Trump, where sitting all together during inauguration smiling. Also, didn’t Russia just announce that they found a mRNA vaccine for cancer and would be making it available for free? Sounds very similar. Stargate, StarLink, twinkle, twinkle little star, I’m not going where you are… https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/russia-vaccine-cancer-9744034/ Zaganostra: … didn’t Russia just announce that they found a mRNA vaccine for cancer [1] There is not and cannot be one single mRNA vaccine for the many, many different types of tumors that develop in all the different cell-types throughout the human body, as far as I know. The whole point of such vaccines is the targeting specificity they’d provide. And yes, each vaccine would be personalized — that’s the point of them. [2] Nor is there anything new about mRNA vaccines for cancer, or anyway the concept. Moderna was originally founded in 2010-2014 specifically to develop such vaccines, and got repurposed when COVID-19 appeared. <Would that be the same “Sam Altman” that Suchir Balaji, who was a whistleblower that mysteriously committed one of the most improbable suicides I’ve ever heard about, worked for? “Derrick Broze speaks to Poornima Rao, the mother of Suchir Balaji, the OpenAI whistleblower who was found dead on November 26, 2024. Suchir went public with his concerns about OpenAI and AI in general in October and was set to be a key witness in the New York Times lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI. “ ~20 minutes. https://www.youtube.com/live/Jv90pgFZuso?si=hTsEdAzCA__Oj4pn Summary – the family did a second independent autopsy and the results support his Mom’s claim he was “happy” and not suicidal. I’m shocked. /s. Good thing trump will make sure the tech oligarchs get $500B asap. also /s. 500 Billion dollars, that would go a long way to make someone a first trillionaire. No wonder it brings smiles to faces of billionaries. “Zelensky demands at least 200,000 ‘peacekeepers’ on Ukrainian soil – Reuters” ‘From all the Europeans? 200,000, it’s a minimum. It’s a minimum, otherwise it’s nothing’ He’s talking about NATO troops of course but 200,000? Wouldn’t that be like all the available troops that NATO has? Check out this page on the number of active military personnel in NATO countries in 2024- https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/ The 5th largest contingent is the UK at 184,860 but that is like the entire UK military as in all of them. How many can the British Army send to the Ukraine then? I would guesstimate about 10,000 people – maybe. You start going through the numbers for each country on that basis and it does not add up to 200,000 people. The only way that it does is by having troops come from that country to the north of the Gulf of America which is what Zelensky is really talking about. But there would be a side “benefit” to having so many peacekeepers in the Ukraine. This Ukrainian guy was saying that they had lost so many men that the country is going to be a demographic disaster. Unless of course you had say 200,000 lonely men on duty in that country that could hook up with all those widows and single women and then problem solved. It made a bizarre sort of sense but more likely those women would use those soldiers as a ticket out of the country to one that is much safer. The Danish F 16 instructor allegedly killed in Ukraine by a Russian missile strike, had supposedly been ‘entertained’ by a Ukrainian woman who subsequently gave his whereabouts away to the Russians. Of course, the story has been denied by Danish authorities, but I did see a tweet in Danish by a guy claiming to know the instructor and that he was dead. Who knows in the Fogh (sic) of war. So maybe these widows and single women could also use them as a ticket to safety in Russia. I’m contractually obliged to report that I have just posted an essay on the idea of a “peacekeeping” force in Ukraine, and related issues. Since any European peacekeepers are by definition NATO soldiers, you think that they would go with the idea of Chinese peacekeepers? To your numbers, Rev, In believe that to deploy 200.000 “peacekeepers” in Ukraine, all in all, 600.000 troops should have to be mobilised accounting for the required rotations. “Entertainers” would be needed a lot, not only in Ukraine, but in nearby reserve places. Romania, Poland? Oh my, you are quite correct. Through rotations you would need your figure of 600,000 troops to be on tap. Can’t be done. I don’t think they would be interested and, as I’ve made clear, the Chinese don’t have the capability for force projection at that distance, let alone to Holland others/ Given that Ukraine cannot win, and that NATO cannot deliver enough people to be killed, it does seem like the real source of manpower would have to be “that country to the north of the Gulf of America” except that Zelensky must also know it’s never gonna happen. So this begins to look more like a desperate attempt to simply keep the gravy train war going. The Ukraine side of this conflict is beginning to remind me of that old Star Trek episode A Taste of Armageddon, in which two planets are fighting a centuries-long war entirely using computers, except that to keep score for the computers, their citizens were obliged to report to “disintegration chambers” in which they would be killed. The Enterprise crew gets caught in the crossfire, so to speak, are captured and being pushed to die in said disintegration chambers, basically in order to keep the “normalized” computer war going and thereby avoid a “real” war. Some eerie parallels here, as the larger narrative is that NATO+US should perform some “duty” to die in the Ukraine (instead of Ukrainian soldiers, to avoid demographic disaster you know), in order to somehow prevail and prevent a larger more “real” war with Russia. It’s just bonkers. I am Nomad …speaking for all Americans So that’s where you deport all those illegals too? I expect that my slow the flow at the border… Bonkers, yes. Trump may seem ridiculous with his Gulf of America but it’s a harmless bonkers so far. That other bonkers is proving horribly deadly. Why is Gulf of America bonkers? To the north of it is North America, to the south of it is South America and it’s also surrounded by Central America and Latin America. Gulf of America seems pretty harmless while not being an actual overreach. Of course when I first heard the idea I was outraged… But then after sleep I saw the sense of it, and the harmlessness. Throw the US a bone, I say As a map person I’m not particularly in favor of presidents renaming stuff. But of course the Dems have been doing it too. There has been some commentary that all the legally dubious outside the box moves by the Dems are going to come back at them from their supposed opponents. Our entire ruling class may have way too much time on their hands. I don’t know about that. Acquiesce quietly to the Gulf of America in order to avoid a stupid and pointless fight and I fear that the next thing you know they’ll be demanding that the Pacific and the Atlantic be renamed as the Oceans of America East & West. How about Gulf of the Americas or if we really want to rub it in we could call it, in honor of our declaration of hemispheric hegemonism, the Gulf of Monroe Or just Marilyn… The Gulf of Mexico was named by Spanish explorers in the 16th Century. They claimed much of the adjacent coastline for Spain. In fact, Spain claimed much of what became Mexico and (Alta California); until the Mexican revolution in 1821. Much of the northern portions of Mexico were invaded by the US Army in 1846 and made Territory’s of the US;later became the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California (Baja excepted). So, since most of the Gulf coastline is adjacent to Mexico and Cuba, the name is appropriate. Throw the US a hand granade, I say I’ve proposed that just the Dead Zone be renamed Gulf of America. I don’t believe that Trump has any authority to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Those are international waters. He may as well try renaming the Barents Sea. What he is trying to do is far from harmless. It is imperial overreach at its very worst. Cartographers should tell Trump to take a hike – down the Orient Express on Denali. Put them in Poland! BTW Zelinskyy is as legitimate a “leader” as any of the puppets US put in Saigon. during that long ago quagmire “Zelensky demands at least 200,000 ‘peacekeepers’ on Ukrainian soil – Reuters” And I want a pony Since this talk of 200,000 peace keepers is a steaming heap of horse manure, dig in. There has to be a pony in there. Early 1945 talk of folly: Imaginary Divisions Early 2025 talk of folly: Imaginary Divisions Once again the 4th turning shows up~ I believe most, if not all, African states have taken a neutral position on the Russo-Borderlands war so presumably the ideal peacekeeping force will consist of 200,000 troops from sub-Saharan Africa. They’ll just love the winters. Is there any official list or source with the real number of troops. Just as you describe it for GB? Out of those 184,860 90% would be dead immediately in case of real war. It’s the well-known NATO paper tiger. But people ask me where do you take your numbers from. Of course, how do you prove that NATO troops are not fit for combat if there is no war. How do you prove the negative? That’s a hard sell in any debate. And that will take off now all over EU. p.s. Of course you can reference the US studies like in Parameter Magazine but that is American and very specific. And you can now prove that NATO tanks are firecrackers but that too needed over a year of negative news slipping through. Additionally to the pre-existing scattered reports about Leopards failing in Syria and Kurdistan which were buried very very deep. >Guillotine Watch It’s going to be very interesting to see if a Nation/regime that attempted to purge billionaire oligarchs from having control over public/foreign policy (Russia/Putin) will trump a Nation/regime that hands over public/foreign policy to them (Trump/Elon, et al). Yes, the China gambit of AI as a public utility is interesting in this regard. To the extent States outside the Oligarchy normalize the IT of the last 40 years as public utilities, capturing the benefits of the tech for the public, many things start looking like Chinese solar & EVs where they have a clear “unfair” advantage from not drowning their productive class in rents. To actually be competitive, Trump should be thinking about the propensity of Chinese billionaires to fall off cliffs and that sort of thing. Instead, he appears to be becoming the “Grifter in Chief”. jsn: To the extent States outside the Oligarchy normalize the IT of the last 40 years as public utilities, capturing the benefits of the tech for the public, many things start looking like Chinese solar & EVs where they have a clear “unfair” advantage Exactly so. You point out what will likely be one of the — maybe the — dominant geopolitical trends of the next few decades. At least if we’re fortunate. So, the CIA will be using AI trained on massive amounts of propaganda to predict the behavior of world leaders. That should go well: “PutinBot, what are your plans for the next few years?” “Well, I plan to eat a bunch of babies, then re-take Alaska. Then, I’ll either die of cancer or poison Ameirica’s water supply to sap and impunity all of their precious bodily fluids; I don’t know which.” You think that the CIA built themselves a TrumpBot to try to predict his actions if he was re-elected as President? Good luck with that one. But this article did finish on a bizarre note. So the CIA is going to bring in Silicon Valley to help drive their culture. Really? Sure they have been joined at the hip since the early days but is the CIA ready for that level of ruthlessness and urge for world dominance? The first thing that comes to mind re what SV has that the CIA doesn’t is massive, obscene payoffs for the winners of the greasy pole competition, so maybe they have a point? Not a good one, but in this timeline it almost makes a perverted sense. Don’t forget that he (Putin), is going to corner the market of washing machines so they have a guaranteed supply of chips for missiles. “PutinBot, can you tell me how effective American sanctions are against Russia?” “PutinBot, can you tell me in step-wise detail how Americans can win in the Ukraine?” “PutinBot, can you tell me where i can find 200,000 able-bodied men to die in Ukraine?” Ding Ding! You win the internet today. “India Set to Take Back 18,000 Citizens From US to Placate Trump” India is not worried by this development at all. As soon as those 18,000 Indians are back home, the Indian government will have them apply for H-1B visas and before you know it, they will be back again but legally this time. And they know that Vivek will always have their back. Re: WHO to lose 1/5 of its budget. Good. No more US influence. I know. Queen Ursula probably still has a contract with Pfizer. Eh, the B & M Gates Foundation can probably pick up the slack. / ;) I suspect that the B&M Gates Foundation is already busy “picking up” the pace of the Jackpot. WHO soon to be World Helots Organization? court rejected the complaint against her re: Pfizer sms I understand that as the US has already paid their dues, that they will still be in the WHO for this year. Meryl Nass has followed all the issues around the WHO, the treaty, etc. very closely. Here’s her rundown on the issues as they stand. MSM is full of errors about the WHO withdrawal, so I will correct them. https://merylnass.substack.com/p/msm-is-full-of-errors-about-the-who (The MSM is full of errors? Can it be? / ;) Thanks. I did not follow the MPox outbreaks carefully at the time. Is Nass’s point #8 correct? The WHO should not be managing international outbreaks, after its well-publicized delays and failures with the 2 largest Ebola epidemics in Africa, and what I would call its ridiculous performance over monkeypox, twice declaring it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. What we need to get rid of is politicized healthcare, and the WHO represents all that is wrong with centralized medical decision making. I am not sure that there are not mistakes in the Nass piece. There is no mention I have found in the WHO Constitution of countries having a right to leave the organisation. IIRC when Warsaw Pact countries sent in their resignations in the 1950s they were not accepted. There may have been resolutions in the US Congress that the US should give a year’s notice if it wished to leave the WHO, but as there is no mention I can see of this in the text of WHO’s Constitution, I suspect the WHO will take the view that US legislation has no jurisdiction over their decisions. Happy to be corrected! It is always dangerous to ‘correct’ other people on the Internet. Are there any international lawyers in the building? 1948. US Code: §290c. Withdrawal from Organization on one-year notice In adopting this subchapter the Congress does so with the understanding that, in the absence of any provision in the World Health Organization Constitution for withdrawal from the Organization, the United States reserves its right to withdraw from the Organization on a one-year notice: Provided, however, That the financial obligations of the United States to the Organization shall be met in full for the Organization’s current fiscal year. (June 14, 1948, ch. 469, §4, 62 Stat. 442 .) https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:22%20section:290c%20edition:prelim) WHO recognizes the US 2025 withdrawal: WHO comments on United States’ announcement of intent to withdraw https://www.who.int/news/item/21-01-2025-who-comments-on-united-states–announcement-of-intent-to-withdraw Adding, the withdrawal is not a claim over the WHO’s future decisions. It is only divorcing from the WHO’s claims over any future US medical decisions, imo adding: The US Congress passed the signatory treaty only on condition of this exception. It still holds. The Warsaw Pact countries may not have made similar conditions to their signing the treaty in 1948. IANAIL, but Art 56 of the Vienna Convention on Treaties basically says that if a Treaty has no withdrawal provision, states can only withdraw if either the provision should have been included but wasn’t, or if the right to withdraw is somehow implicit in the text (which I don’t think it is. I suspect that in practice, and because the WHO is a subsidiary organ of the UN, it never crossed the minds of the drafters that someone might want to withdraw. Well, you may be right about the Vienna Convention. However, USians being a somewhat stubborn and shrewd lot, imo, ( certainly in 1948 after another ‘great war’), have in Constitutional law the US condition for treaty acceptance, which must be approved by Congress with any provisos the Congress may impose. That is the law of the US. In the US and the WHO case, US law at time of signing prevails. And I thank you for your question and research. It’s an important point. Is that the Meryl Nance of the Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccination group? Shooting the messenger? ;) Ad Hom much?

This article provides a bit more context “Two others suggested the move is aimed at helping the newly installed Trump health officials understand the vast flow of information coming out of the health agencies. The pause, according to one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal agency conversations, “seemed more about letting them catch their breath and know what is going on with regard to” communications. If the communications pause lasts more than a week or two, it could become concerning, that official said, noting that under the Biden administration, White House and HHS officials extensively reviewed material related to the coronavirus before it was released.” https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/trump-officials-pause-health-agencies-communications-citing-review/ar-AA1xCis1 Platforming Moon of Alabama’s ignorant anti-DEI and anti-trans views? Gross. DEI seems like a jobs program for college grad aspiring PMC managers who need more things to manage. The US seems to have a surfeit of aspiring PMC wannabes. / ;) Wait. Are you saying that the Professional Managerial Class is not really the problem but the surfeit number of kids of the Professional Managerial Class trying to hustle themselves some new, made-up bs jobs? :) Why, whatever gives you that idea? / ;) It’s not the kids, it’s been going on for decades. Hiding behind the overtly racist and sexist reasoning of most anti-wokers, you can see glimmerings that some are starting to understand this is the real issue. The problem is not important jobs being filled by non-meritocratic means; the problem is the jobs themselves are BS sinecures that add costs with no benefits, and a secondary problem is that right-wingers are disqualified by ideology from getting most such sinecures so they have no incentive to go along. The scramble for jobs is just that tight. The economy and opportunities are just that bad. But instead of working against monopoly and Wall St powers, working for increased minimum wages, working against offshoring and open borders(increasing competition for entry level jobs,working for universal healthcare and the like, the Woke like the Moral Majority before it makes no economic class claims; it only fights for a bigger piece of an ever shrinking middle class slice of the pie. It is no threat at all to the ever increasing wealth and power of the richest and of Wall St. In that sense it is a distraction from the real economic problems most face. In fact, it gained its biggest jump in public awareness, via the MSM, after O bailed out the TBTF banks and the Occupy Wall St movement. It was as if a memo went out saying “Must change subject from bad bank financial behavior to bad middle class social behavior.” It’s a distraction from the big fight, imo. Seems like it worked, too. / my 2 cents Divide and conquer is an old idea. To quote Gilded Age robber baron Jay Gould: I Can Hire Half the Working Class To Fight the Other Half You have just made an excellent argument for a Vanguard of the Deplorables. Someone has to pick up that pointy ended stick (power) lying in the street and face it in the right direction. Peter Turchin would like to say some words about that. Elite oversupply, etc. You mean like “Chief People Officer”? DEI should be umbrellaed within Creative Writing departments where future baristas congregate. On the opposite end of DEI is the enduring belief in meritocratic hiring practices which in it’s own right is nonsence as well. As one of those evil PMC types, Ive found that the DEI messaging can be counterproductive in how it tends to be framed but all the teeth grinding about it comes off as nothing but coping from people who expected the world to be handed to them. Thanks. Good point about opposite ends of the stick. I’d say messaging can be counterproductive in how it tends to be framed can be applied to both ends. Nonsensical applications is our default setting. Not disagreeing with you point. Only pointing out the origin of merit hiring was a big push by good government reformers – the so-called goo-goos . It was their efforts to cleanup graft, influence peddling, and the patronage hiring systems in local, state, and federal employment; it was their effort to hire people competent and qualified for the job without regard to a job seeker’s party affiliation or family or business connections. Some states, including my own, were still using the patronage system for big state govt entities into the 1950s. And of course later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (EEOC) included in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was created, expanding the scope of merit hiring. “The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in a broad array of private conduct including public accommodations, governmental services and education. One section of the Act, referred to as Title VII, prohibits employment discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion and national origin. Title VII applies to private employers, labor unions and employment agencies. The Act prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, wages, assignment, promotions, benefits, discipline, discharge, layoffs and almost every aspect of employment.” The issue I have with DEI is that it is missing the letter “C” (Competence.) All the diversity, equity, and inclusion available does not making for a functioning organization, if they don’t have relevant capability. (And I mean ‘capability’ not ‘credential’.) I can’t recall the author – there was a blogosphere post a while back that made an argument that the biggest issue facing the West was overproduction of elites. Peter Turchin is considered the current shepherd of that longstanding idea. His most recent book was reviewed a number of places including here. The Donkey Show banked on a tiny percent of the population being trans being so important that it became all encompassing, or in essence they couldn’t read the room, and then came the broom. It could have be any other wedge issue. Abortion worked for 50 years and #metoo had its time in the sun. If the population ever comes to some sort of agreement in how to deal with transpeople in public, they’ll just put in something else. Maybe polygamists or people who always wear people will be next in line. What’s important is keeping the masses divided and having each other. “… people who always wear people will…” We’re well into ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ territory here. No matter how cynical you are, you are always behind the curve. Major autocorrect snafus by meeee! Could be the next wedge issue – should people practicing terrible grammar online be shunt off in padded cells with very poor cell signal? Should pedantic individuals be a hunted class for HTS snuff videos? Should we all get AI brain implants? Will future wars be fight between people wearing people and people wearing cats? Will the people wearing skunks win? Fear not. There will not be a supply issue concerning “canon fooder” for as long as the population exceeds the dreams of glory of alpha type personalities. Pompous prolix pedants are a credit a dyad. My best guess is that “Online Grammer and Correct Content” will be a part of the curriculum in the FEMA Re-education Centres. I rather like “canon fodder.” DEI is pro segregation. All those racial affinity groups make me sick. Go ask my dad about the affinity bathrooms, affinity water fountains, and affinity schools from his youth in the south. Same thing, different era. More Moon of Alabama please, and less wokie wokism. As Emma pointed out above, identity politics is pro-segregation. The natural result its weaponization is an overweight backlash. This cycle kills any chance of society gaining a beneficial outcome. Using the theory that laws are tools of social engineering, we must ask ourselves, what purposes are the “woke” class of laws intended to promote? Per the above, positing conspiracies for social trends is overly reductionist. Since most social “movements” are the results of one form of a congruence of interests or another, we can somewhat simplify the problem by investigating the milieus from which the impetuses that “power” the ‘movements’ arise. As always, ‘who benefits’ is the primary question. …which would be the consultant class within the booming industry of “elections”. Thanks. Just another way of catering to the 1%. Big profit center. To me, the whole point of the links is to present viewpoints as diverse as the Kyiv Independent to the Valdai book club. If someone wants a safe news feed that just confirms their viewpoints, get a Facebook account. Sorry if that sounded snotty, but your comment was out of line. And that is from someone totally agnostic on DEI matters. It will be a long 4 years! And it didn’t happen soon enough :-) I disagree with it too but Bernard at MoA is good on a lot of foreign policy and military stuff and that’s where he’s coming from. My personal view is D and I are important. We can work on that as eyes open thinking human beings, without getting it hammered into our brains by a staff of 200 headed up by some PhD in gender studies who got a sinecure. E is a cruel joke meant to fog our brains so we ignore getting screwed over by the 1% and its running dogs. None of those letters deserve a senior manager assignment, less a whole department. While we’re at it, let’s get rid of the real baddies – HR! Hedges had this interview with Christian Parenti on woke in general as a problem for academia (as he sees it.) It’s not entirely DEI – but was a bit related I think Sept. 25th 2024 How Wokeness Kills Class Politics and Empowers Empire (w/ Christian Parenti) | The Chris Hedges Report https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/how-wokeness-kills-class-politics The problem with DEI: it´s too complex a scientific matter to give it a general all/nothing treatment. It already starts with the complex biological realities, realities which are scientific facts vs. social realities and the creation of laws and regulations which have to simplify. Yes, I put that up to provoke people just like you, trans advocates who have no problem with running roughshod over women’s rights. As a woman, I am not on board with people with penises in women’s bathrooms. Nor am I on board with people with XY chromosomes competing in women’s sports. People with XY chromosomes, even if they take hormone-suppressive drugs early, have higher levels of muscle mass, sturdier bones, and less joint laxity than XX people, giving them an unfair advantage in sports. Women fought too hard over generations for safe spaces and their own sports to have a tiny minority of trans trample over them. Hear, hear, Yves. Absolutely. Ditto >>I am not on board with people with penises in women’s bathrooms. Not just trans women, but women with a “mannish” appearance are going to be facing a rough time… No, manish doesn’t cut it. That doesn’t matter. There are many “dykes” who are still women, though they make great Tom Boys. Can’t tell a book by looking at the cover. I read a list of track and field records. By age 15, boys outperformed *adult* women in all categories. No trans men in women’s sports. Let us not pretend that there are no genetically determined biological differences between the sexes, particular as regards relative physical strength coupled with a greater propensity for physical aggression, such that there are no venues such as women’s sports, prisons, and safe houses, where the exclusion of biological males is not warranted. I have an idea. Let’s have an all female plebiscite to decide such questions, including trans women if you like, and let the women decide. Take rowing for example. An elite male rower will be 6-6 tall, 210 pounds, and will pull a time of 5.45 on an ergometer for a 2000 meter distance. An elite woman will be 6-1 or 6-2, 170 pounds, and will pull a time of 6.30 on an ergometer, nearly a minute slower. Men are bigger, stronger, and faster, period. On average! In classes as big as men and women, the difference within a class are greater than the differences between the classes. So there will be individual cases otherwise But yes, that average difference is why women are indoctrinated to be submissive and manipulative, since on average, if a woman physically confronts a man, she will get the shit beaten out of her. That happens to ‘skinny guys’, as well, in America. Talented comedians are ‘short’ because they have a lifetime of experience avoiding this ‘danger’. YMMV ;) Height-challenged male here, who was very mouthy as a youth. The sport of wrestling was a safe way to take out all my anger, as they classed us by weight! Didn’t say short guys are quiet. Comedians are quite fascile with language and use it to defang big guys. There are no weight classification on ‘the street’. :) on average, if a woman physically confronts a man, she will get the shit beaten out of her. . . Unless her name is Dakota Ditcheva. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-01-22/Per-capita-income-in-rural-Xizang-nears-national-level-in-2024-1An2VDnVMmA/p.html January 22, 2025 Per capita income in rural Xizang nears national level in 2024 The per capita disposable income of rural residents in southwest China’s Xizang Autonomous Region saw the fastest growth in the country in 2024, nearing the national average, a remarkable accomplishment considering the region’s challenging plateau conditions. During the year, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in the region was 21,578 yuan (about $3,010), reaching 93.3 percent of the national average level, Li Jianshu, deputy head of the Xizang survey team at the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a press conference held during the annual session of the regional people’s congress concluding on Wednesday. The figure marked an 8.3-percent increase from the previous year, 1.7 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate, Li said. He further noted that the per capita disposable income of urban residents reached 55,444 yuan, up 6.8 percent, 2.2 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate. The per capita disposable income of all residents in the region surged by 8.2 percent to 31,358 yuan. This growth rate, the highest among the country’s provincial-level areas, exceeded the national average by 2.9 percentage points. Mountain-locked Xizang was once the only provincial-level contiguous poverty-stricken region in China, burdened by its high altitude, harsh environment, poor transportation and limited resources. By the end of 2019, however, the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty. Thanks to the development of infrastructure, the booming tourism market, and the accelerated growth of various industries in the region, the income structure of residents in Xizang has greatly improved, leading to enhanced living standards for its people. By the end of 2019, however, the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty. Thanks to the development of infrastructure… Amazing. But if you listen to John Stewart, there is a trade-off between “developing Infrastructure” and modernizing public transportation such as NY subways, and that trade-off is our “freedom.” the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty… …but at what cost? Thanks. I particularly enjoyed the header China helping the world is suspicious. “Orwellian” may be tired terminology, but from my perspective…… level of irrelevancy Stewart has sunk to makes road-kill more important – he’s acting punch-drunk now – first Apple beat him up, then called on the carpet for his Wuhan moment on Colbert – now he’s a palooka taking dives – “I could have been a contender” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z66hw6q-zY&t=27s Just when you thought the numismatrix couldn’t get any more silly, the race to out meme one another in matters of cryptocurrency raised it up another notch. Let’s talk ramifications of the eventual reckoning sure to come? We didn’t hear a peep about crypto out of Genocide Joe, but Trump hit the ground running, and he’s an outlier in that it’s a young persons’ Mug’s Game-not something Gen X or Boomers are all that interested in. When they get burned (3rd degree at a minimum, possibly 4th degree lesions) young adult males are gonna be hopping mad, and how do they react? and how do they react? Something tells me it could involve firearms. The AR-15 type has been a popular choice (e.g., Thomas Crooks, Kyle Rittenhouse, et alia), and the vegan activist woman who shot up the YouTube HQ in California (she had been deplatformed) used a 9 mm Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol, but post-Luigi a 3D-printed “ghost gun” is probably the go-to. How do they react? The likely reaction is verbal and actual violence against the weak, also likely preceded by some kind of Immigrant Shock Horror-type news panic or its equivalent… People are transfixed by their dis-infotainment of choice, and too cowardly to go after the actual sources of their suffering, even if they know what it is. Breaking out of that neoliberal fugue state, which requires the quiet and honest introspection that this society is threatened by/incapable of (regardless of political affiliation), seems increasingly remote. As I opined above, the present situation is crying out for a ‘Vanguard of the Deplorables.’ In a less socially retarded society, these silly things like meme coins would not be banned but would be properly classified as gambling. Because there is no utility to $TRUMP or $DOGE we would see them treated like sports betting. Most states now allow sports betting, hence the cottage industry of web sites like Fan Duel, and the NFL embracing gambling on games and not just in Vegas. The past few days have me so excited. Sam Altman, Trump and AI are going to cure cancer…right after the Trump admin retakes the Panama Canal and goes to Mars. My question: will it all get done in the first 100 days? Golden Age in ‘Murca! Does that mean we all better buy gold because it’s all going to sh-t? The customers are usually none too happy when a salesman way oversells the product. Trump appears to be an accelerationist’s dream. Trump appears to be an accelerationist’s dream. “Throw another tire on the fire….”, (some Cohen Bros movie, I think is where I got that) Here’s hoping “acceleration” is not ’25’s word of the year. Buy gold? Too late, CostCo is already sold out! >The Black Book of Communism Is a Shoddy Work of History The British Conservative politician Daniel Hannan had a similar message as he prepared for “the most monstrous of centenaries.” According to Hannan, communism was far worse than slavery or Nazism: “The Atlantic slave trade killed perhaps 10 million people, the Nazis 17 million — but the Communists killed 100 million.” The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which runs a museum in Washington, carries the following message on its website: “Communism Killed Over 100 Million: We’re telling their stories.” If we judge by the number of victims, the worst ideology must be capitalism. That is a lot of statistics. Fauci asking when his contributions to world health will get a mention? The industrial era has been far more about capitalism than communism so surely a Black Book of Capitalism is in order. In fact the Russian Revolution was in many ways a result of WW1 and WW2 in turn a result of that. And in any case pretending our social life is all about political/economic theories is dubious since wars and victims have been a feature long preceding the ideologies. It is interesting how all the many horrors of capitalism going back to the British and Dutch East India Companies, the Atlantic slave trade, the King Leopold’s Belgian Congo, several large famines in the British Empire, plus much else in the more than four centuries of its existence. Heck, many of the coups done by the United States were and are done for the benefit and often direct requests of corporations. Proponents of capitalism want to look only at the benefits, which often are very large, of capitalism without looking at the extremely high costs of it, which is dishonest. “surely a Black Book of Capitalism is in order” It exists: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzbuch_Kapitalismus although Kurz would have preferred to call it ‘The Mills of Satan’ (Die Mühlen des Teufels), in reference to Blake, but the publisher wanted the title for sales reasons. You can download it by searching: Robert Kurz Schwarzbuch Kapitalismus – exit-online.org Communism and capitalism are different flavors of extractive profit economies. The root problem is that in all those societies, a few people ruled over everyone else, imposing law and choosing how to enforce. Same problem in America, Soviet Union, Great Britain, China. No wonder they all have histories of huge amounts of death and exploitation – they’re different flavors of the same underlying problem, where a few people rule over everyone else. All of them forbid people from taking responsibility for their culture and standing up to abuse, because that’s supposedly the police’s job, and they’re not allowed to do their job – honest police, known as whistleblowers, don’t last long in any unhealthy culture. There are actual human societies with a gift economy – that is, economies that reward sharing rather than profiting, and the highest leaders are the ones that share and give the most, rather than elevating the richest or the servants of the rich, as happens in America, China, Russia, etc. If you want an alternative to the tired debates between communism, capitalism, and socialism, I suggest looking at these gift economies. A book called One Disease One Cure goes into all this with many beautiful stories, exploring how people can live in respectful ways, and all the usual trouble that happens when a few people rule over everyone else. Not only that it is way far ahead, but is still counting. P.S. The Nazis killed 17 million, out of which 27 millions of Soviets. art history/ painting “On T. J.

Haven’t heard anything, yet, from Canadians, about Trump pardoning Proud Boys who are terrorist in Canada, and some other countries. An obvious question is what are the odds Trump will also go after the Civil Rights Act? It seems like a logical next step. These days many seem to equate DEI with anti-white discrimination (which it is decidedly not but facts and truth are irrelevant). And with this move rescinding EO 11246 as part of anti-DEI, Trump is equating the civil rights movement with DEI and with anti-white discrimination, which his administration wants to reverse in all shapes and forms, real or imagined. PLAAF has a sixth generation fighter type aircraft! They will probably build a few dozen and test around them. While the Lockheed is building more aircraft for the dividend flow. Every new F-35, and all those tooling about out in the world, needs a new engine which is not in anyone’s plan! “There’s reason to be worried about the plethora of pardons from Trump and Biden” Politico would never mention it but there is a qualitative difference between Biden’s pardons and Trumps. With Biden he was pardoning his own (crime) family because of all the corruption that they are involved in, political operatives like Milley, the Jan. 6 committee and Fauci to buy their silence and in fact more pardons than any President in history by a long shot. Trump pardoning those protestors was not in the same class. The full might and weight of the US was used like a bludgeon to go after anybody there that day. People who walked quietly through an escort of police, looked at the interiors, took a few selfies, and then left were facing charges that would lead to years in prison. It was gross and needed correcting. Maybe not all of them should have been released but it was the fastest way to do it. Would you believe on the news they claimed that a police officer died that day? Some people died that day and one was murdered but none of them were police. US’ left wing pundits continue to proclaim the Jan 6th political prisoners as attackers. They may have frightened the democrats over the vote fraud, but they deserved a hearing denied them. The issue is that democrats ran Maoist show trials. Pardons merely reverse their crimes against US citizens rights. The continued drivel on the news is boring There had already been over 60 state and federal lawsuits, hearings and investigations by state government and election officials, manual full and partial recounts, and audits, the process and results of which were open to the public. The Capitol rioters may have been there to protest the fact that their preferred candidate wouldn’t be president despite having lost the election, but the “hearing” on this had already occurred. I will also point out that long after the Capitol riot the “hearing” continued with additional investigations including one initiated by the Trump administration, public scrutiny, lawsuits, and at least one full manual recount organized and funded by Republican supporters. That is why Schiff and Cheney need pardons. Ford lost to Carter for using the Pardon power as a get out of jail free card for Nixon. Having re-purposed DoJ for Lawfare, the Ds are now using Pardons as get out of jail free cards at scale. I agree, what Trump did he did for people not tied directly to his own corruption, while Biden is in full get out of jail free mode. Not to suggest Trumps memecoin and innumerable other activities aren’t corrupt, but he’s been playing the legalized crime game his whole life and as such has other buffers for his surrogates. Whenever I read an article that uses the term “debunked” I immediately assume that there is some truth in what they claim is “debunked”. The Raw Story article a case in point – they claim Jim Jordan is still pursuing “debunked” Jan 6 theories – so I figure Jordan is on the right track. – ‘Stefanik paints a grim picture of a UN she wants to reform’ – Politico Stefanik is about as miserable a candidate for our “top diplomat” as one could find, but she follows a long line of these. No surprise here. But what has struck me about her confirmation is the bipartisan support for her confirmation. As this Political article points out: “The moderate Republican turned ardent Trump backer is generally expected to be easily confirmed and without much serious opposition from Senate Democrats who see her as less polemical than other nominees and broadly agree with her on the need to support Israel.” In addition to fighting the Chinese take-over of the UN, Stefanik has pledged to dig out it’s “antisemitic rot.” She also agreed with Smotrich and Ben Givr that Israel has “a biblical right to the entire West Bank.” I’m glad Trump could find a “less polemical” candidate for UN Ambassador. No need for Senate Democrats to slow-walk her confirmation. She’s ready to go! Are you sure she does not think she is being appointed Secretary General? Worse than Bolton? More or less effective? We’ve been sending our worst for decades now. We can all look forward to Rhianna pulling her security detail in 2035. She has some major Upper Class pull, along with the Harvard pedigree and I’ve heard people speculate that this is going to be her foreign policy training, setting her up for a run for POTUS. Her TV stylist has been upping her game over the past year too. I wonder if Trump ordered that, it would be in character. She could have been defeated early. She’s a perfect empty vessel, now battle tested and ready for action “Acceleration, Decapitation, Mobilization” **** At some point (except mobilization) this will make sense. Maybe soon, if the Donbass fronts reach the point of collapse of Ukraine forces on a bigger scale. Trump’s recent comments these past few days show he is just as out of touch and misinformed as his predissors regarding the war in Ukraine – saying Russia has lost “a million men” (and Ukraine much less) its economy is hurting and declining and the war is not going well for Russia and Putin needs to stop the war for domestic and other reasons and needs to get Western sanctions relief. Putin and Russian establishment have repeatedly said Zelensky is not the legitimate President of Ukraine. So what is he? The West will never allow Russia to “win the peace” until all current EU leaders are regime changed. So IMO, as Ukraine collapses, they will work with what remains of Ukraine to turn it into a type of terrorist launching pad to inflict whatever damage on Russia that they are able. At some point, Russia will need to fix her mistake of normalizing direct attacks by the West upon her. The time for Russia to accelerate (and maybe decapitate) may be approaching. But then what do I know? The West will never allow Russia to “win the peace” until all current EU leaders are regime changed. Biden is gone, Trudeau is gone in a few weeks, Sholz is gone in a few weeks, Starmer is not looking all that good, Orban and Fico would be happy to be out of it as, I think, will Meloni. Macron is looking crippled. I think major support is melting fast. I am not so sure about NATO resolve. “Following Trump’s lead, Lorenzo Sewell, a Detroit pastor who spoke during the president’s inauguration, announced the launch of his own memecoin later that day.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jKMjOjg1M&ab_channel=M1/ Richard Pryor Show 1977 – Rev James L White , Who Reminds us of Daddy Rich; God & Federal Green! Pryor was great…Rev Sewell was such an embarrassment to MLK tradition. I can only imagine what some Baptist or other Southern Christian American/black people felt by imagining a NY Italian with his shirt open to his belly button and gold chains around his hairy chest coming out and representing Italian culture. The song in the clip says it all. In one of Richard Pryor’s movies he is an onlooker to a financial huckster promoting some scheme. The Pryor character raises his voice and says that “this looks like a pyramid scheme” . The promoter responds with, “no, no, it’s a trapezoidal scheme”. We need more comedians and the media taking on the financial and political schemers of USA society. But I fear it’s “not gonna happen” “Which Way Is Up” and “Blue Collar” – notable Pryor films about the working class vs “the system”. LOL, I remember that scene. He even shows on the board. its after 9am here, still 19 degrees, with a vigorous southwest wind and windchill around 4 or 5. but itll get up to 55 today, they say…. so’s i can turn on the water, again. let all the birds out for the first time since friday…stupified, blinking in the sun. sheeps reckon they should continue getting fed twice a day. i ended up going forth and cutting more wood at the woodshed, and down there at one of the dead trees along the fenceline in the front pasture. just to keep things running smoothly. still waiting for a part for the woodstove in my room…and man have i missed it. bored out of my mind…sore from laying around under covers in far too many layers of clothes, watching tv. greenhouse toms and peppers made it just fine…because i’m a bad mofo. and have slept for 2 or 3 hours at a time throughout. now, with the sun well up, greenhouse is the place to be…about 65, right now…didnt let it get below 40. plants are rather thirsty, tho. and i smell like a goat…really look forward to a superhot bath this evening, after critters are done….espsom salts, dishsoap and prolly some rosemary tossed in…the big tankless set to 125…then the little booster tankless in greenhouse helping it along…end result is a bath of around 114 by the time i get in it….eureka!, and all. likely make a beer run, since the kegstand is unlikely to thaw in time,lol. and laundry manana afternoon, when it heats up again…and i suppose dishes at some point. it’ll be almost 70 degrees by sunday, they say. one of my superpowers…i endure things…and i endured this. doesnt mean i hafta like it. nebraska can keep their frelling winter weather. Around 6 below zero this morning in Central PA. I’m glad I have a wood stove to help furnace. I’m sure people around here without wood stove will be getting a heck of a heating bill….family in SE Florida freezing in the 57 degree temp, cold for down there. Speaking of the cold, and sorry to change the subject, but this is nuts. I live in a small NW Ohio town. It was below zero last night, and in the single digits for the last few days. There is a young adult girl who lives with her mother in an apartment complex. According to the neighbor she has severe anxiety and claustrophobic characteristics, so she doesn’t go inside. There is a picture of her laying on the front porch of her house with blankets over top of her. She was out there all night. A neighbor called the police and they said they couldn’t do anything. She also contacted a county commissioner. He hasn’t been able to do anything either. How can this happen? How can they allow this girl to lay out there and freeze to death. I don’t know if they even know if she’s alive? She is an adult so you can’t use child abuse angle (I guess, she does live with her mom). I honestly don’t know how this hasn’t went viral. Unbelievable. As an out-of-cert EMT in a 911 community (in a former life) we were able to request that patients be taken into custody if they were a danger to themselves or others. Usually drunks or homeless transients during cold weather. We would be called by the authorities to help make the determination. It’s a tough call. Sometimes, but seldom, appreciated. Thank you for this. I thought something like this is possible. Tough call – no doubt – but it needs to be done. If I were a city council member, police, whoever, I would call for an emergency meeting and demand something be done – by someone. If you are out in these freezing temperatures you are in danger – period. It shouldn’t be difficult. Thanks for your input. I’ll put that task with Amforta’s cat responsibility as things I would not be good at. Swinging back on course, I figure there are a lot of plumbing issues in parts of the country that don’t normally get well below freezing temps. Here in the southern Greens of Vermont, today’s high is 12 and todays low is minus 12, which I woke up to. I got out of bed twice last night to stoke the wood stove. We did get eight inches of very high quality snow Sunday. yeah. we aint set up for this sort of thing. y’all got pipes buried deep, steep roofs, etc. and, using mom as a proxy, i guarantee that i’m likely the only one around here who preemptively shuts off my water and drains the system(built it that way)…because theres few things i dislike more than being a plumber in the mud when its in the 40’s and 50’s, with wind(we’re always windy out here). its also why i do woodstoves…i can burn pallets if i have to…or take the chainsaw to the side of the highway, for that matter. this year and last, ive had a giant pile of what used to be mom’s enormous 100+ year old pecan trees to work on…too big for me to cut up by myself, but eldest likes that sort of work. also have the biggest parts of one of neighbor’s standing dead oaks…4 more along his part of the road i can get whenever i need to. so i got wood…but since im usually on my own, im playing catchup with the cutting and splitting. even so, i dont hafta rely on $ for propane or electricity….save like right now, when one of the woodstoves is missing a part. “normally” we only get a few days like this per year…but its been weird since the 2 week ice age in feb 2021. ive only shut off my water twice, so far…but thats a lot compared to a “normal” winter. during feb 21, whole county lost power for a week…but we managed to keep this big old drafty thing above 40,lol. and used hurricane lamps, etc for light. i’m built for the heat. both me, myself, as well as my structures. give me 105 in the shade any old day. i could never live where some of yall do,lol. and when i’m out at dawn on mornings like this, in the wind, checking on things(another service i get no credit for, i might add)…i think about you folks in vermont, maine and ontario…let alone people i know in edmonton… up to almost 40, wind dyin down…so ima do my town run in a minute…and go cut some wood…then hopefully, the lowest faucet, which happens to be in deep shade on north side of house(had a heater on it for 2 hours) will thaw enough to close, so i can assess that situation,lol. barnyard is easier to turn back on for the same reason its the first i shut off…every faucet is in the open. amazingly, sheep still have water…deicers worked well…and they apparently arent that thirsty when its this cold. sigh. I got a blow dryer duct taped to a hockey stick. That and a couple of clamps for hands free pipe defrosting, heh heh. Not all pipes are deep in the ground. Five dollar propane here. Getting the truck up the drive is the hard part. You got a portable mill? Is pecan wood good for finishing work? Plus, you have oak. About the cold. I’d wager you’d enjoy it without the wind. I sat out last night once the thermometer cracked zero. Somehow the cold intensifies the silence. Downside was my beverage froze up pretty quick. if i have a good fire in the hole at the bar…where im somewhat sheltered from all but east or west wind…i can take it down to about 40…and thats with sufficient beer and/or whiskey, and 3 layrs plus 2 heavy bathrobes, plus furry hat. i read in SciAm some time ago that shivering is how one acclimates to the onset of cold season…trust the science, and all,lol…so ever since, in november, with the first real cold front, you’ll find me remaining nekkid out there…for as long as i can stand it…then layering up by the roaring inferno(old pallets are great for that) and making my way inside…where i will always have woodstoves, etc already doing their thing. again…i do not like the cold. november through february is my very least favorite part of the year. but that sciam method seems to work a bit, as i find i am a bit more cold tolerant than usual. as for today…and dreams of a superhot bath…well, god laughs at our plans. forgot to open one(1) faucet on my side of the system…the one that goes to the shed where W/D lives…and i dont feel like another trip to town.(pipedope mustve gotten cold, bc its all watery and useless…and i was sure i had another ball valve to patch that, but i dont) i want my 2 hours in the warm greenhouse with beer and a hogleg and art pepper and sunshine, ere i go forth and put up critters. still smell like a frelling goat,lol…but i got lotsa cornstarch, some real frankincense, and a nose full of snot anyways….ha!…something cedar fever is good for, at last! I always enjoy your checkins. Enjoy your bath! DEI or no DEI. DEI is segregation. Identity politics is a doorway to unequal outcomes. “Trans” is a tiny population exploded into a world shattering problem. Is any of this true? To what extent is it false? Now there is an executive order mandating two genders. There are two genders in the majority, but then there are those in between. If you treat them as “flyover country”, you can populate it with wonders and with monsters and never be the wiser. I used to drive from the east coast to western Montana each summer. I did so because I wanted to see what was there. I wanted to see who was there. No surprise that coastal and bi-coastal sophisticates were thin on the ground. And no surprise that the inhabitants of “flyover country” were much like those I had left behind. As Yves says, “Quelle surprise.” Whatever else DEI is or was, it became a bludgeon in the hands of people with a political agenda. I choose not to characterize that agenda except to say the bottom line is or was, “You will do it our way … or else. Or else you will suffer in a manner of our choosing.” Seemed a totalitarian’s way of thinking to me. Are there, were there those with motives of the greatest and most disinterested purity? I am sure there are and were, but they were either never in charge or lost control to the other crowd who found a vehicle for their fantasies of control. Is there a “moral to the story?” Not sure, but if there is I nominate always look at the places in between. If you treat them as “flyover country”, you can populate it with wonders and with monsters and never be the wiser. That’s a choice sentence and worth a think. Trump 2.0 An addition to this section of links. (Insert voice of Larry Cable Guy’s “git-r-done!”) So D-man’s placement speech wailed on about all sorts of inefficiencies and lack of gov’t’s abilities to confront crises at the homeland. To Angelino readers of NC, maybe one can pass along this bit of news to the new prez while he tours Calif and surveys the scene. Let him know if means to “git-r-done!”, well hands on deck sir. Since the new prez is keen on making schools great again, let not a moment pass when he can take some wind out of Newsom’s sails and announce a yuuge fed-led investment. or else, it’s just another brick let loose off the wall that is US infrastructure. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/la-schools-wrecked-fires-plead-162513682.html “[S]chool officials say they need more than anything else is cash to pay for new places to learn…They are turning to crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to quickly raise money… Of the more than 15,400 structures wrecked by the Palisades and Eaton fires so far, at least 18 schools — including charter or private schools — have sustained significant damage or been destroyed, according to data from the California Department of Education and certain schools. While property insurance and government aid will help cover the cost to rebuild, that will take time that mid-year students can’t afford.” Re DeepSeek, here’s how it wraps up a response to “Tell me about Naked Capitalism.” Congrats to all on proper surfing of this eddy of the AI wave: Conclusion Naked Capitalism is a valuable resource for anyone interested in critical perspectives on finance, economics, and politics. Its commitment to independent journalism and its willingness to question mainstream narratives make it a standout in the world of financial blogging. If you’re looking for an alternative to traditional financial news outlets, Naked Capitalism is well worth exploring. “Chinese AI software DeepSeek was built at a fraction of the cost of American companies like Meta & OpenAI, but performs better. From the user perspective, DeepSeek is 96% cheaper than ChatGPT and other popular LLM.” Considering the Magnificent Seven Stocks and their prominence in the stock market indices and the gains in index funds, I wonder whether the news about the Chinese AI software DeepSeek might cause some disturbance of the AI frenzy pumping up the Magnificent Seven. While part of their value is the result of their control over key avenues of commerce, I suspect there might be some ‘fat’ in their present stock valuations. I asked DeepSeek to recommend some good independent news sources about the war in Ukraine. This is what came up with: 1. The Kyiv Independent 2. Meduza 3. The New Voice of Ukraine 4. Bellingcat 5. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) 6. The Insider 7. Ukrainska Pravda 8. OpenDemocracy 9. The Associated Press (AP) and Reuters 10. Local Independent Media in Ukraine (like Hromadske and Zaborona) That says a lot about their source of training data. You should ask recommendations for bad sources. Scholz at Davos: Europe Must Arm for War with Russia Will Scholz share his bomb shelter with all of us? It’s only fair. cupie doll: Will Scholz share his bomb shelter with all of us? You wouldn’t want Scholz to share his shelter because you wouldn’t want to be in it with him when an Oreshnik comes calling once he and the EU declare their war on Russia Perhaps he does not want to be reminded of the WWII joke that the abbreviation LSR, for Luftschutzraum (air raid shelter) was subverted by the German population to mean “Lernt schnell Russisch”, i.e. “learn Russian, quick”. From the Tweet: It also potentially enables plenty of AI applications that were just completely unaffordable before. Say for instance that you want to build a service that helps people summarize books (random example). In AI parlance the average book is roughly 120,000 tokens (since a “token” is about 3/4 of a word and the average book is roughly 90,000 words). At OpenAI’s prices, processing a single book would cost almost $2 since they change $15 per 1 million token. Deepseek’s API however would cost only $0.07, which means your service can process about 30 books for $2 vs just 1 book with OpenAI: suddenly your book summarizing service is economically viable. Great, so now we can cheaply produce inaccurate summaries. Finding a way to make LLM queries potentially profitable is going to unleash an even larger debacle upon the world. It might be a decade before the extent of this debacle becomes clear, depending on how subtle the errors in LLM output are. But others have rightly pointed out that this erodes critical thinking skills, so we’re going to have an entire generation that knows nothing, and has so much damage from COVID, isn’t functional anyway. And this will be the labor basis for our ongoing civilization. Fun times, no? Multiple Pandemics and lack of critical reasoning skills might just ultimately solve the Climate crisis, simply through increasing depopulation and inability to build and maintain damaging toys. Yes, but if you read the commenters above, they neither believe in paying authors for their work or in the concept of competence, so frankly we’ve already entered a new dark age where believing is more important than learning. We just haven’t realized it yet. You’re conflating labor with capital by using the term “work” in an ambiguous way. Maybe we need to start physically punishing PMC when they try to use rhetoric to manipulate others’ emotions using public media. Wdyt? Would that effectively remove petit-bourgeois self-righteousness from the public sphere? It takes a lot of work to write a book, as you’d know if you ever wrote one. If you are lucky, you can sell the book (i.e. its copyright) to pay for that work so as to be able to eat. That’s what copyright was invented for because book printers would simply steal the content. They had the capital (the book presses) and the author got nothing. Somehow today people believe they are entitled to read that book, or train an AI with it, and the author should get nothing. That’s a good way to end authorship, and ensure the only future reading material will be press releases. You forget the era post WWII where Gov funded science and it was shared widely/freely to expand discovery manifold. Gov held the IP, as it were, only gifted away and be abused by private interest for self interest via social status incentives. Social psychology informs more here than dialectal rationalizations. Not to mention per your thrust that most that is written these days is more a matter of post marketing and not individual artist driven motives. All made more complex by how Silicon Valley sorts lead the agenda to gate keep all and everything by being the both platform for readers and library they could pay to read. I mean just look at the Reese Witherspoon Book Club Model Lmmao …. look it up mate … Elon Musk will reinvent copyright, and fix everything. Well, considering how much of the history of intellectual production you erased from history just so you could perform your little virtue signal and conserve your tiresome little institution games, maybe you are incompetent to discuss the matter of copyright. You’ve all proven yourselves manifestly unqualified to run a larp for 2500 years and you think your childish sniveling rises to the level of a FACT? Lmfao, even. I feel no shame whatsoever trampling all over your epistemic “private property” considering that you’re a liar by omission. Also, as AI generated output proliferates, it will increasingly generate content from its own output. AI coprophagy (eating one’s own excrement) is not a recipe for quality output. Concur. I thought I would write a few lines about a sensible gun law that was passed by the California Legislature when I was still living in Oakland more than 20 years ago. That law required the California DOJ to compare the names and Id’s of convicted felons and wife beaters with the names of ID’s of people who had registered firearms before the became prohibited persons. Where there was a match ( As in the case of Sherrif Ross Mirkarimi) the DOJ would generate a letter to that criminal requiring that they provide proof that either their conviction was being appealed or that they had disposed of their firearms legally, withing 30 days. If said proof was not provided in a timely manner a felony arrest warrant was issued and sent to the appropriate law enforcement agency for service. The first objection came from a Southern California Sheriff ( IIRC Riverside County) who complained to the press that if he enforced the law he wouldn’t have any patrol deputies left ( He said the quiet part out loud) the PIO of that office confirmed that @35% of their deputies had pled guilty to spousal abuse. A few other reporters queried other LAw enforcement agencies and the ones that were dumb enough to answer came up with figures as low as 20%. Needless to say not many reporters pursued the matter…their editors and owners were not enthused. The other reason cops didn’t like the Law was that someone might get hurt, someone who mattered…like a cop. So the Cops pursued matters that were much more important, like Civil Asset Forfeiture which yields $4,000,000,000 in profits per annum and which is armed robbery under color of Law. Meanwhile in Gaza. https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/22/day-1-gaza-ceasefire/ OK, could someone explain the phrase, “Open source software that gates basic auth behind a paywall?” I know what open source is, and I know what a paywall is, but I am unclear on the whole, “Gates Basic Auth,” thing. I think that they are saying that the vendor is claiming that it is open source, but requires payment to access the program, which would not make it open source, and it might potentially make it fraud.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has regained the top spot as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $3.46 trillion, above Apple (AAPL, Financial) $3.35 trillion. On Tuesday's trading, Nvidia rose 2.2 percent, and Apple fell 3.1 percent, sharply due to analyst downgrades, citing poor iPhone sales and a lacklustre consumer electronics market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The fact that AI is dominating the decisions around this historic shift demonstrates why it will take over the economic world. Nvidia's rise is part of a surge in demand for the company's graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are critical for powering AI applications in autonomous vehicles, data centres and other high-growth sectors. Nvidia exceeded 100 percent earnings growth for its third quarter of 2024, along with a 94 percent jump in revenue to $35.1 billion. These results underscore how the company is a key enabler of AI transformations in industries. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said: "Our GPUs are driving the AI-driven transformation across industries." AI is at the heart of every business, and we are entering a new era of computing. Overall, the slowdown in these markets is illustrative of broader strategic issues impacting consumer electronics companies. The company has lost money, with their market cap down to $3.33 trillion compared to a high just a few months ago. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Microsoft relaxes data center grip on OpenAI amid $500 billion joint venture

By Stephen Nellis and Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday said it has changed some key terms of a deal with OpenAI after the ChatGPT creator announced a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new AI data centers in the United States. President Donald Trump gathered the leaders of the "Stargate" effort at the White House on Tuesday to announce the deal, saying it was intended to help keep the United States ahead of China and other rivals in the global AI race, using chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Since 2019, Microsoft has had arrangements with OpenAI that gave the Redmond, Washington-based company the exclusive right to build new computing infrastructure for OpenAI. Microsoft, in a blog post, said it has "approved OpenAI's ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models." That opened the door for OpenAI to work with Oracle. A person familiar with the deal said that Stargate is a joint venture structured as new entity in which OpenAI has an equity stake, governance rights and operational control. It will have a separate board appointed by the founding members and its own CEO, this person said. The venture will also have other investors including United Arab Emirates firm MGX. Microsoft, along with Nvidia and Arm, will be a "technology partner" in the new venture, but is not listed as an equity funder. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is will be the entity's board chairman, according to a statement from OpenAI posted on social media site X. But Microsoft said that it still retains the exclusive right to offer OpenAI's API - technology shorthand for application programming interface, which is the main way that software developers and business customers buy OpenAI's services. That means Oracle will not be able to host OpenAI's primary source of revenue. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Microsoft's statements. Microsoft said it has "revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways" with OpenAI. "The key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030, with our access to OpenAI’s IP, our revenue sharing arrangements and our exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs all continuing forward," Microsoft said. Microsoft also said "OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training," referring to Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

Title: SK Hynix’s 26% Gain This Year Under Pressure From Trump Trades

(Bloomberg) -- This year’s 30% AI-driven rally in shares of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. faces threats as political issues and valuations push local investors toward domestic-focused companies. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Korean retail traders are on course for their biggest monthly withdrawal from the memory chipmaker in at least a decade. With the stock on course for its best January since 2009, market observers say the temptation to take some money off the table is high. AI leader Nvidia Corp. lost steam this month on concerns over competition and slower growth. Korean investors, meanwhile, have been rotating into non-tech beneficiaries of President Donald Trump’s policies as well as smaller local stocks expected to enact corporate reforms. “The market is paying more attention to the issues that could see swift changes after Trump takes office,” such as in the energy sector, said An Hyungjin, chief executive officer at Seoul-based Billionfold Asset Management Inc. “I have concerns that if Nvidia’s rally stalls, whether SK Hynix can gain further.” Results due Thursday morning from SK Hynix are expected to show record quarterly net income of 5.9 trillion won ($4 billion). That comes as the firm is benefiting from its position as a leading supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to work alongside Nvidia’s AI processors. Its share price has more than doubled in two years on the AI excitement, though that lags far behind the sevenfold gain in Nvidia. The broader chip sector, including memory, has been restrained by lingering concerns over sluggish demand for autos and electronics. SK Hynix shares gained 3.4% on Wednesday, joining a rally across regional peers, after US President Donald Trump’s announcement about a joint venture to fund AI infrastructure. Korean investors may be taking profits on SK Hynix after its big gains, “as memory prices are still expected to be trending downwards in the first half of 2025,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. At the same time, foreign investors that have driven the stock higher “could be viewing memory as a laggard in the AI space.” SK Hynix’s rally has made the stock look pricey. Its trading at a price-to-book ratio to 2.8 times, above its three year average of 1.6 times. Beyond valuations, investors are being lured away from the tech sector and into sectors including shipbuilding and nuclear power on expectations for boosts from Trump’s policies. At home, some investors expect the opposition party’s corporate reform agenda to gain traction following the impeachment of the President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law. Smaller, domestically focused companies with room for improvement on shareholder returns are seen as particular beneficiaries. “There are many companies that could outperform with the commercial code revision,” said Marcello Seongsoo Ahn, a portfolio manager at Quad Investment Management Co. “SK Hynix shares may rise but their gains will be outpaced by those companies.” Top Tech Stories President Donald Trump announced a joint venture to fund artificial intelligence infrastructure worth billions of dollars with the leaders of Softbank Group Corp., OpenAI LLC, and Oracle Corp., an effort aimed at speeding development of the emerging technology. Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products. Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. With President Donald Trump having returned to power, one of the first things he has done is revoke a 2023 executive order signed by Joe Biden seeking to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence posed to consumers, workers, and national security. The revoke marks a significant shift in federal oversight of artificial intelligence technology. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings According to Biden’s orders, developers of AI systems posing risks in any way to the US government, the economy, or even public health or safety, needed to share the results of safety tests with the government, which was in line with the Defense Production Act. The order also required agencies to create orders for testing and address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. As of now, all key safety and transparency requirements for AI developers have been revoked. While it is currently unclear how the Trump administration will handle rules and regulations regarding AI, it is likely to be more of a “hands-off” approach. Regardless of how it is handled, the one clear thing is that this technology will continue to be extremely transformative. As quoted by CEO of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world has yet to completely recognize the extent of change AI will bring to every aspect of human life. “In terms of the risks … this is a technology that no one today really appreciates, truly the level of disruption that it’s going to create, affecting everything from our lives, our businesses, human capital, employment, and every sector is going to be disrupted. And I think that while there’s a lot of opportunity, it also presents significant amount of risk, which is today unclear, because the technology is moving so fast and we’re all trying to catch up as much as possible”. Al Mubarak is also optimistic about the future of AI and the UAE’s ability to leverage its investment strategy. “The demand is going to be profoundly high in terms of the enablement of that technology. That means “the technology, the AI enablement, which is the infrastructure side of it — be it energy, be it transmission, but also all forms of technology, of energy technology that’s going to help fuel this huge demand, I would also add to that data center build-out, chip build-out.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The analyst noted that after talking to key ServiceNow partners, he has found deal activity in Q4 to be “solidly in-line or slightly better” which is “a slight improvement” from Q3. The analyst further argued that ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is “second only to Microsoft (MSFT) with tangible AI revenue”.

JetBlue (JBLU) is now accepting Venmo (PYPL) as a payment option for flights booked on its website, making it the first airline to do so, the company announced on Tuesday. The feature will soon be available on the airline’s mobile app. U.S. customers can now use their Venmo balance, linked bank accounts, or debit and credit cards to pay for flights directly. “Adding Venmo offers a seamless payment option for customers who enjoy the ease and convenience of the Venmo platform,” Carol Clements, JetBlue’s chief digital and technology officer, said in a press release. Flexible payment options have grown in popularity in recent years, with many consumers preferring digital platforms like Venmo for everyday transactions. The move is part for JetBlue’s ongoing efforts to enhance its digital experience for travelers, according to John Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of consumer at PayPal, Venmo’s parent company. He noted in the release that the new offering could make managing shared expenses easier, especially for group travel. JetBlue has already introduced other tech-driven features, such as a countdown to boarding on the lock screen of its mobile app and more accessible gate information, the company said. In Sept. 2024, the airline announced plans to add airport lounges for loyalty members. While JetBlue is the first to add Venmo as a payment option, other major airlines like Delta (DAL), Frontier, and United (UAL) may consider adopting the digital payment option as consumer demand for flexibility grows. Meanwhile, JetBlue remains focused on improving its financial performance, particularly after disruptions such as last year’s CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage and Hurricane Milton. “Our number one goal remains returning to operating profitability, and growing our unit revenue is essential to achieve this,” said Marty St. George, JetBlue’s executive vice president of commercial and planning, in a statement in Oct. 2024. “Looking ahead to 2025, I am optimistic about the outlook for our revenue performance, especially as JetForward initiatives begin to deliver results.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto market thrives on audacious moves and life-changing fortunes. Given the sea of altcoins traded in the space, DTX Exchange is one making rounds right now. Now, experts are predicting significant returns for this viral altcoin. Fast forward to 2025, and DTX shapes up to deliver such gains as well. But rather than rely on hype, this asset introduces innovative features that’d make its rally swifter than that of Dogecoin’s 2021 run. The excitement is building, and if history is any guide, DTX could become the next Dogecoin. Meme coins dominated the crypto space with their eye-catching returns and vitality. But as the hype slowly fades, DTX Exchange is a new player packed with cutting-edge features and revolutionary tech. It aims to become the world’s hybrid trading platform, bridging the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges. This would enable traders easy access to various assets— stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex pairs, and tokenized ETFs. This diverse range of products leverages blockchain’s top-tier security. Furthermore, users can trade these instruments without completing rigorous KYC, thus ensuring unmatched privacy and autonomy. What sets DTX apart is its proprietary layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, which seamlessly merges tradfi with Web3 technology. Catering to all trading styles, from intraday to swing traders, the platform’s distributed liquidity pool ensures smooth and hassle-free trading across markets. The excitement doesn’t stop there. DTX’s presale has already raised over $12 million, and tokens are flying off the shelves at $0.14, with a launch price pegged at $0.20. This pricing structure offers a golden opportunity to lock in substantial profits before the token is listed publicly. DTX Exchange emphasizes decentralization, eliminating central governance and enabling traders to retain complete control of their funds through its Phoenix Wallet, a non-custodial solution. Holding DTX tokens unlocks exclusive perks, including staking rewards, reduced trading fees, and enhanced user privileges. With its revolutionary approach and record-breaking presale, DTX is positioning itself as a major contender in the DeFi space. As analysts and traders buzz with anticipation, DTX Exchange could become the next big thing, offering traders a unique blend of innovation, privacy, and freedom. Dogecoin’s meteoric rise was powered by community-driven hype rather than utility. This made it into one of the most memorable crypto stories. However, trading at $0.37 today, it’s clear that for DOGE to hit its previous highs, it needs more than just hype — it needs more substantial utility and institutional support. The current price trend reflects significant bearish pressure, indicative of broader market volatility that’s affecting many cryptos. Despite its meme coin status, DOGE struggles to maintain price stability, partly due to its speculative nature and limited use cases compared to rising platforms like DTX Exchange. This is where DTX Exchange steps in. Offering a robust and utility-rich ecosystem, DTX provides a fresh opportunity for DOGE enthusiasts to tap into potential 100x growth by 2025. If you’re looking to capture those nostalgic gains, DTX may just be the next big thing to watch. The crypto world is all about bold moves and early opportunities, and DTX Exchange is primed to become the next success story. With revolutionary utility, strong community backing, and undeniable momentum, DTX is set to deliver massive returns. The stage is set, the excitement is palpable, and the chance may be too good to miss.

Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances”, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Bank of America’s CEO said that they’ll jump into crypto payments if regulators allow it. Do you think with Trump’s executive orders and the new administration things will be better for Bitcoin investors going forward? CHRISTOPHER MCMAHON (CM): I think that’s a great question. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more favorable environment for crypto. Bitcoin got up to $109,000 the other day. I think today it’s still $103,000. We actually see it just from this momentum, the president endorsing it, the new head of the SEC coming in as a kind of a crypto guy, we see the thing to be $130,000. There is still a lot that’s unproven. The Bank of America (BAC) chairman was right out and saying if some rules change… Something we have to remember about crypto, which I think we forget about, we get so excited. Two of the biggest guys in the history of crypto are both in jail right now, so even though we have some ETFs that people can buy or they can go directly and so they can feel a little bit safer, it’s still the Wild West. And I think the B of A guy was right on when he said, look, if we get some regulation, this could come to Main Street. It’s not on Main Street yet, but I think it’s coming. And for investors, I think it’s a tremendous opportunity. And I think everybody’s portfolio should have some exposure to crypto. I think when folks say, ah, that’s, you know, that’s no good. Right? That’s bad because I’m not familiar with it, I think they’re really doing their portfolio a disservice. Not a huge allocation, but even a balanced portfolio, maybe 3% or 4%, maybe up to 10% if you’re feeling aggressive. AM: Okay. So it’s still largely speculative, but you see $130,000 as a potential price target. Is there a timeline that you believe will happen? CM: We think before the end of the year because the president and his wife both had meme coins drop yesterday, didn’t they? Which is amazing. And I think this environment is so positive for crypto that we have to understand that people who weren’t investing in crypto yesterday are talking about it today and there’s going to be more people buying it, and some of those large crypto ETFs. And the funds really haven’t penetrated the market as much because the brokers don’t believe it. The financial advisors didn’t believe it. Now the financial advisors are actually getting the memo. They’re going to offer it to their clients and we’re gonna start to see that available. I think we’ll actually start to see it available in some retirement funds in the next couple of years, large 401Ks, which will be a complete gamechanger. AM: Do you see any risks or challenges this year with Bitcoin? CM: Yeah, there’s enormous risk with Bitcoin. [Because] if today someone said, Why is it worth $103,000? I would say that’s based on wild optimism because no one uses Bitcoin to conduct business today. Criminals use Bitcoin to conduct business today. That’s the reality of it. Some very avant-garde early adopters are using it, but most people aren’t using it yet. Have you seen those bank machines, the crypto machines in the convenience stores? I was in a store the other day and I said to the woman, “I’m sorry, has anyone ever used this machine?” And she said, “It’s been here for six months, I’ve never seen anybody use it.” Then she said, “No, wait. Someone actually put their drink on it about three days ago.” So I thought, the person who put all these machines out there really spent a fortune on them, but I think it’s gonna have to be a buy and hold. I think we’re going to have to be ready for extreme volatility because I think we’ll see $130,000, as I said, but I think we’ll also see $70,000 again in the next year or so. So be up and down. AM: Okay. $70,000, as well. CM: Yeah, it’s not gonna be a straight line at all. AM: Okay, gotcha. Which happens first? CM: I think the $130,000 happens first because we’re on the top of that wave, I think where we are right now. AM: Okay. So you said 3-5% is a decent allocation for speculating on Bitcoin. What about the other 95-97% of our portfolio right now? Should people load into Mag Seven again in 2025 or diversify away? CM: That’s a great question and if we own some of those tech stocks now, this Mag Seven, I think we should hold most of them because we’ve been rewarded for Tesla (TSLA) lately. It’s been unbelievable. But I think if you take the Mag Seven the last few years, take the Mag Seven out of the S&P 500, it’s only been averaging about under 8% a year. That means as this market starts to broaden out, there’s enormous opportunities in traditional industries, right? Consumer cyclicals is a huge place. There can be energy. We very much like banking. We like it quite a bit. So we wouldn’t double down on the Magnificent Seven right now. AM: If we’re holding Mag Seven in 2025, then what picks do you have for retail investors? CM: A couple that we like very much are Constellation Energy (CEG). We love it. And it’s simple because it’s a broadbased energy company. We like energy as a whole, and a lot of the larger funds are holding Constellation Energy. Interestingly, they dipped their toe in both pools because they signed a large deal with Microsoft (MSFT) recently to supply energy for for all the AI data centers. That means that they are guaranteed about a 30% runup in their stock over the next 12 months, in our opinion. So we like Constellation Energy quite a bit. Well, there’s a mining company we were talking about earlier, Newmark Mining. We love them. They’re doing copper, they’re doing gold. They’re one of the largest gold and copper miners in the world. Gold is a hedge against inflation, of course. We’re not really worried about the inflation play right now. What we’re really thinking about is the uses of gold and copper and manufacturing. AM: And you mentioned financial services, too. What picks do you have? CM: We like American Express (AXP) quite a bit. We like MasterCard (MA), not as much as we like American Express. And generally we don’t like the regional banks. The regional banks are scaring us a little bit. And here’s why. There’s about a trillion dollars of commercial leases that are coming due. Interest rates haven’t been cut enough yet and unfortunately we have some concerns. Our rush hour traffic’s lower because people just aren’t coming into town as much. Even though we are forcing companies to come back downtown. We see some of these buildings refinancing at higher rates with lower occupancy as a potential real headwind. You know, that’s a term we use, ‘headwind’. We don’t want to say potential crash, but a ‘headwind’ for the market. Unlikely that that would bring the market down and stop all this momentum. Therefore, we like the big banks, the big banks are continuing to get bigger. And we think most of the big banks that we’re used to are undervalued by about 10-12% this year. Why take on undue risk when you have that kind of runup in a very predictable stock. AM: Fascinating. So in your book, there are a lot of tips on how people can invest based on their values. What’s one thing you could tell our audience today? CM: I would say be informed. I think your audience knows how to use the internet as well as anybody does, use these tools that are out there now. I would say technology is the king and demand of your advisors, if this is important to me, I need you to prove to me how you’re vetting this appropriately.

AM: Okay. $70,000, as well. CM: Yeah, it’s not gonna be a straight line at all. AM: Okay, gotcha. Which happens first? CM: I think the $130,000 happens first because we’re on the top of that wave, I think where we are right now. AM: Okay. So you said 3-5% is a decent allocation for speculating on Bitcoin. What about the other 95-97% of our portfolio right now? Should people load into Mag Seven again in 2025 or diversify away? CM: That’s a great question and if we own some of those tech stocks now, this Mag Seven, I think we should hold most of them because we’ve been rewarded for Tesla (TSLA) lately. It’s been unbelievable. But I think if you take the Mag Seven the last few years, take the Mag Seven out of the S&P 500, it’s only been averaging about under 8% a year. That means as this market starts to broaden out, there’s enormous opportunities in traditional industries, right? Consumer cyclicals is a huge place. There can be energy. We very much like banking. We like it quite a bit. So we wouldn’t double down on the Magnificent Seven right now. AM: If we’re holding Mag Seven in 2025, then what picks do you have for retail investors? CM: A couple that we like very much are Constellation Energy (CEG). We love it. And it’s simple because it’s a broadbased energy company. We like energy as a whole, and a lot of the larger funds are holding Constellation Energy. Interestingly, they dipped their toe in both pools because they signed a large deal with Microsoft (MSFT) recently to supply energy for for all the AI data centers. That means that they are guaranteed about a 30% runup in their stock over the next 12 months, in our opinion. So we like Constellation Energy quite a bit. Well, there’s a mining company we were talking about earlier, Newmark Mining. We love them. They’re doing copper, they’re doing gold. They’re one of the largest gold and copper miners in the world. Gold is a hedge against inflation, of course. We’re not really worried about the inflation play right now. What we’re really thinking about is the uses of gold and copper and manufacturing. AM: And you mentioned financial services, too. What picks do you have? CM: We like American Express (AXP) quite a bit. We like MasterCard (MA), not as much as we like American Express. And generally we don’t like the regional banks. The regional banks are scaring us a little bit. And here’s why. There’s about a trillion dollars of commercial leases that are coming due. Interest rates haven’t been cut enough yet and unfortunately we have some concerns. Our rush hour traffic’s lower because people just aren’t coming into town as much. Even though we are forcing companies to come back downtown. We see some of these buildings refinancing at higher rates with lower occupancy as a potential real headwind. You know, that’s a term we use, ‘headwind’. We don’t want to say potential crash, but a ‘headwind’ for the market. Unlikely that that would bring the market down and stop all this momentum. Therefore, we like the big banks, the big banks are continuing to get bigger. And we think most of the big banks that we’re used to are undervalued by about 10-12% this year. Why take on undue risk when you have that kind of runup in a very predictable stock. AM: Fascinating. So in your book, there are a lot of tips on how people can invest based on their values. What’s one thing you could tell our audience today? CM: I would say be informed. I think your audience knows how to use the internet as well as anybody does, use these tools that are out there now. I would say technology is the king and demand of your advisors, if this is important to me, I need you to prove to me how you’re vetting this appropriately.

Title: Here is how high Bitcoin's price can go in 2025, according to a wealth advisor

Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances”, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Bank of America’s CEO said that they’ll jump into crypto payments if regulators allow it. Do you think with Trump’s executive orders and the new administration things will be better for Bitcoin investors going forward? CHRISTOPHER MCMAHON (CM): I think that’s a great question. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more favorable environment for crypto. Bitcoin got up to $109,000 the other day. I think today it’s still $103,000. We actually see it just from this momentum, the president endorsing it, the new head of the SEC coming in as a kind of a crypto guy, we see the thing to be $130,000. There is still a lot that’s unproven. The Bank of America (BAC) chairman was right out and saying if some rules change… Something we have to remember about crypto, which I think we forget about, we get so excited. Two of the biggest guys in the history of crypto are both in jail right now, so even though we have some ETFs that people can buy or they can go directly and so they can feel a little bit safer, it’s still the Wild West. And I think the B of A guy was right on when he said, look, if we get some regulation, this could come to Main Street. It’s not on Main Street yet, but I think it’s coming. And for investors, I think it’s a tremendous opportunity. And I think everybody’s portfolio should have some exposure to crypto. I think when folks say, ah, that’s, you know, that’s no good. Right? That’s bad because I’m not familiar with it, I think they’re really doing their portfolio a disservice. Not a huge allocation, but even a balanced portfolio, maybe 3% or 4%, maybe up to 10% if you’re feeling aggressive. AM: Okay. So it’s still largely speculative, but you see $130,000 as a potential price target. Is there a timeline that you believe will happen? CM: We think before the end of the year because the president and his wife both had meme coins drop yesterday, didn’t they? Which is amazing. And I think this environment is so positive for crypto that we have to understand that people who weren’t investing in crypto yesterday are talking about it today and there’s going to be more people buying it, and some of those large crypto ETFs. And the funds really haven’t penetrated the market as much because the brokers don’t believe it. The financial advisors didn’t believe it. Now the financial advisors are actually getting the memo. They’re going to offer it to their clients and we’re gonna start to see that available. I think we’ll actually start to see it available in some retirement funds in the next couple of years, large 401Ks, which will be a complete gamechanger. AM: Do you see any risks or challenges this year with Bitcoin? CM: Yeah, there’s enormous risk with Bitcoin. [Because] if today someone said, Why is it worth $103,000? I would say that’s based on wild optimism because no one uses Bitcoin to conduct business today. Criminals use Bitcoin to conduct business today. That’s the reality of it. Some very avant-garde early adopters are using it, but most people aren’t using it yet. Have you seen those bank machines, the crypto machines in the convenience stores? I was in a store the other day and I said to the woman, “I’m sorry, has anyone ever used this machine?” And she said, “It’s been here for six months, I’ve never seen anybody use it.” Then she said, “No, wait. Someone actually put their drink on it about three days ago.” So I thought, the person who put all these machines out there really spent a fortune on them, but I think it’s gonna have to be a buy and hold. I think we’re going to have to be ready for extreme volatility because I think we’ll see $130,000, as I said, but I think we’ll also see $70,000 again in the next year or so. So be up and down.

Title: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips

Nvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world’s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple’s (AAPL) shares slid. The chipmaker’s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia’s shares are up 2%. Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform” in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras. “As Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,” Jefferies analysts said in the note. Meanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the “high teens” in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.

Title: Did Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dump or Bet on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Shanda Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Subscribe here to receive future editions. I'm back in New York City after spending nearly a week in San Francisco for the annual JPMorgan Health Care Conference – the largest gathering in the U.S. of biotech and pharma execs, investors and analysts (and health reporters, of course). The week featured questions about the incoming Trump administration, updates on business outlooks and drug portfolios, heightened security on the ground and, for the first time in recent memory, sunny weather in San Francisco. The news kept coming all week, even after the conference ended mid-Thursday. The Biden administration on Friday announced the next 15 drugs included in Medicare price negotiations, which include Novo Nordisk's blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and its obesity counterpart Wegovy. But after companies announced a handful of deals last week, I'll zero in on some takeaways for M&A activity in the industry in 2025. M&A appears to be off to a good start this year. But the question is whether it will last. Some of the deals announced during the conference boosted optimism, particularly Johnson & Johnson's proposed $14.6 billion buyout of Intra-Cellular Therapies. That appears to be the biggest transaction we've seen in the pharmaceutical industry since 2023. That agreement came amid a wave of smaller deals from GSK, Eli Lilly and lesser known radiopharmaceutical companies. "That's five deals in one and a half business days," Stifel analyst Tim Opler said in an email to clients last week. "This is going to be a very different year for M&A than 2024." Last year was marked by smaller and smarter deals in the pharmaceutical industry, according to EY's M&A Firepower report released last week. Big pharma sought deals with lower price tags for products and companies in earlier development, which could pay off more handsomely in the long run. While this year has started off with more activity, the report pointed to potential restraints on M&A in 2025: Ongoing margin pressure on biopharma companies is still "reducing the appetite for big spending," and the most prized acquisition targets in the industry are still commanding high premiums in the market, among other factors that could dampen transactions. That tracks for some large pharma companies. During a presentation at the conference after J&J announced its Intra-Cellular Therapies deal, J&J CEO Joaquin Duato said "for us, larger deals are more outliers." "The majority of the value that we create is through smaller deals and partnerships where we can use our scale," Duato said, pointing to the 75 smaller deals that J&J inked last year. But the EY report said there are "strong structural reasons to expect a return to dealmaking," including the industry's $1.3 trillion in dealmaking "firepower," which refers to the ability to fund transactions and make deals. Large pharma companies are also bracing for upcoming drug patent expirations that could wipe out $300 billion in revenues by 2028, putting more pressure on them to offset losses with new products. Pfizer, for example, faces a wave of patent losses over the next few years that could threaten some $17 billion to $18 billion in annual sales, the company's CEO Albert Bourla said during a presentation at the conference. But Bourla said the company's series of deals in recent years, such as its acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen, should help offset those losses. The Trump administration could also offer "significant tailwinds" to the industry by cutting corporate taxes or changing FTC policy "as part of a general deregulatory shift," according to the EY report. But we'll have to see how this all plays out later this year. Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com. Now that JPM has come to a close, 2025 is officially underway for the health-care sector. But we can't dive into the year ahead without first taking a look at the venture funding landscape for digital health in 2024. On the whole, it was a year of the haves and the have nots. Digital health startups in the U.S. raised $10.1 billion across 497 deals last year, according to a new report from Rock Health. That total fell from $10.8 billion in 2023, and is about in line with the $8.2 billion raised prior to the pandemic in 2019 when adjusting for inflation. Digital health M&A hit a decade low last year, as the segment notched just 118 deals. An increase in early-stage fundraising activity, along with smaller late-stage deals, account for the lower investment in 2024, Rock Health said. This could spell trouble for later-stage startups that raised money at sky-high valuations during Covid, potentially pushing them toward acquisitions or shuttering operations entirely in 2025. Additionally, large megafunds, health-systems and tech companies held an outsized amount of influence over digital health in 2024, Rock Health said. Venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst, which secured 20% of all committed LP capital in the U.S. in 2024, were the sector's top investors, for instance. And while artificial intelligence was still a hot investment area within digital health, it's becoming harder for startups to beat out large incumbents. Rock Health said tech companies like Microsoft that can afford to build and maintain expensive foundation models pulled ahead in health-care AI, as did organizations like Epic that can deploy applications of those models on an enterprise-wide scale. There's still room for smaller AI startups to find a niche within health care, but Rock Health said they'll need to "think carefully about their positioning." "These dual trends—early-stage startup activity amidst big moves by large healthcare players—have created a David and Goliath dynamic in the healthcare innovation landscape," Rock Health said. If JPM was any indication, we're in for another interesting year in digital health. We'll see what 2025 has in store. Read the full report here.

Title: Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid shares fall as Trump kicks off his anti-EV agenda

The Detroit automakers’ shares are rising Tuesday while their fully-electric rivals saw their stocks fall as President Donald Trump began tearing into his predecessor’s pro-EV moves. “We will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric-vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers,” Trump said in his inaugural address. “You’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” Later on Monday, he issued an executive order to eliminate the “EV mandate, terminate state emissions rules that limit the sale of gasoline-powered cars, and consider eliminating any subsidies for EVs. There is no nationwide U.S. electric-vehicle mandate, but some states, led by California, have implemented their own rules to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles, while the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a rule limiting tailpipe emissions. Trump also directed agencies to stop handing out funds tied to Former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provided funding for EVs and other clean energy infrastructure. More than $82.5 billion has been allocated to 164 EV-related projects, creating 63,659 jobs, through the IRA, according to E2's investment tracker. The president is also expected to scrap the IRA’s $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers, which has helped keep costs down and boost sales for automakers. Electric truck maker Rivian’s (RIVN) stock fell by more than 6%, while luxury EV maker Lucid’s (LCID) shares dropped by more than 4%. Tesla (TSLA), despite Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump and a price target raise from Piper Sandler, fell almost 3%. “Not sure how the math works for elimination of the EV credit to be bullish,” for Tesla, the Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black wrote Monday. Black noted that Germany and France’s moves to end their EV tax credits contributed to Tesla’s sales volumes falling 41% and 34%, respectively, on an annual basis. The stock may also be down because of Musk’s alignment with Trump, as well as reactions to a gesture he made while speaking at Trump’s inauguration parade on Monday. Tesla lost $15 billion in brand value in 2024, according to a new report, partially due to Musk’s political rhetoric and brash behavior. The Detroit automakers will also be affected by Trump’s EV plans, but have their gas-powered and hybrid portfolios — which still account for most of their sales — to fall back on. Ford Motor Co. (F) and Stellantis (STLA) shares are up by almost 2% and more than 2%, respectively. General Motors (GM) shares gained almost 5% in trading Tuesday, partially boosted by an upgrade from a “hold” rating to “buy” from Deutsche Bank (DB). Analysts led by Edison Yu say that GM’s recent moves to close down its Cruise self-driving unit and restructure its China business, along with its recent buybacks, give them confidence in the company. “While there are concerns about the cycle and potential policies of the new Trump administration, our view is that these risks are already very well-known, and there’s room for positive surprises,” the analysts wrote on Tuesday. One such surprise could be Trump declining to follow through on his plans to slap Canadian and Mexican imports with tariffs, which would affect most automakers.

Title: As Trump Takes the Wheel, Big Corporations Extricate From DEI, Climate Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2025 9:46:07 AM PST by george76 ‘A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,’ Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said.. After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024.

Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race.

Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Title: As Trump Takes the Wheel, Big Corporations Extricate From DEI, Climate Programs

Posted on 01/21/2025 9:46:07 AM PST by george76 ‘A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,’ Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said.. After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024.

Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race.

Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

January 21, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Your one-stop shop for data visualizations that explain complicated and cool stuff in digestible ways. top spots The tech industry has seen some brutal layoffs in recent years — but, if employee reviews are anything to go by, Big Tech companies are at least keeping their existing workers happy. To uncover the best states and cities for Big Tech employees, Switch On Business analyzed Glassdoor employee reviews for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta published between January 2023 and October 2024, then ranked companies' locations by average employee rating. The best city for Apple workers was Palo Alto, California, where employee ratings average at 4.48 out of five. The biggest disparity between the highest- and lowest-rated cities belonged to Amazon. The company's employees gave Herndon, Virginia, an average rating of 4.24, compared to just 2.73 in Buena Park, California. There wasn't a single US location where Google or Microsoft employees rated their experience below 4.0, on average. Meta's best state for workers was Florida (4.29), while the worst-rated was California (3.90). When it comes to the lowest-rated places for tech workers, company headquarters were often among the spots with the poorest employee reviews. Click images to enlarge Via Switch On Business.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks traded in the green on Tuesday, but tech lagged as investors digested President Donald Trump's first policy moves, with future tariffs on Mexico and Canada front of mind. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. But the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was broadly flat as the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) struggled. Wall Street is bracing for volatility as the new president storms ahead with executive orders and actions, with energy and trade center stage. It's the first day of trading in Trump's second term, as US markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Markets got a dose of relief as Trump held off from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes expected by many on his first day in office. China got a surprise reprieve as Trump failed to act on promised high duties on its imports. US stock futures rose, and the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) pulled back from a near two-year high on Monday. But the mood shifted after Trump said later in the day that he was looking at imposing 25% duties for Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1. And Chinese stocks (000300.SS) closed out Tuesday with only slight gains, suggesting investors aren't convinced that a US-China reset is coming to avert a trade war. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell about 4 basis points to around 4.57% early on Tuesday, recovering somewhat from a deeper drop in Asia trading. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a ride, rising to a record higher above $109,000 on Monday as Trump was sworn in and the new president issued an official TRUMP "meme coin" token. The leading digital currency then fell steeply early Tuesday after a hoped-for pro-crypto push failed to appear in the first policy actions. It was trading lower but still above $103,000 at last check. The next batch of quarterly earnings will provide more food for thought for investors. Netflix (NFLX) is expected to deliver strong results when it reports after the bell. Meanwhile, earnings at Charles Schwab (SCHW) soared nearly 50% as trading activity climbed by double digits. D.R. Horton (DHI) also beat expectations despite a soft housing market, while 3M Company (MMM) issued optimistic full-year guidance, driven by organic sales growth. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 4% in early trading Tuesday, reversing premarket gains on the first trading day since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president scrapped a pro-EV policy put into place by his predecessor. On his first day in office, Trump wasted no time shedding the skin of the outgoing administration, revoking 78 executive orders made by former Democratic President Joe Biden during his tenure. One of those Biden-era policies that was revoked mandated that half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030. Other EV stocks fell on the news. Lucid (LCID) tumbled nearly 7% while Rivian (RIVN) slid 5%. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) stocks were up. US stocks climbed across the board on Tuesday as investors digested President Donald Trump's first wave of executive orders, with future tariffs on China and Mexico at the forefront of stock traders' minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also climbed about 0.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and other tech megacaps boosted the overall index. Economic data: No notable economic data releases. Earnings: Netflix (NFLX), 3M Company (MMM), Capital One (COF), Charles Schwab (SCHW), D.R. Horton (DHI), KeyCorp (KEY), Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), United Airlines (UAL), Zions Bancorporation (ZION) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: BofA chief: The Fed may have to respond to Trump Bitcoin holds retreat as Trump omits crypto from Day 1 orders Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 18% in holiday quarter Trump eyes historic 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Investors get set for stock laggards to rally on Trump bets: BofA 3M stock rises as Q4 profit beats estimates on strong demand Huawei seeks to grab market share in AI chips from Nvidia in China Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Sure, I’d love to work in an office with ‘masculine energy’

Time Published: 2025-01-21T15:15:00Z

Advertisement January 21, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min ​Freelance creative Julie Seal, among other things, used to work at Meta. She was particularly interested in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s call for “masculine energy” in the workplace. Here, she explores the good and the bad aspects of what that could mean. I’d love to work in a place with masculine energy. “Sheryl hired great people and taught me how to run a company. She deserves credit for so much of what Meta is today,” said Zuckerberg in 2024. A few months later, he’s saying his former colleague is responsible for the diversity and the ‘culture issue’ brought about by Sheryl’s ‘feminine energy.’ But I think he’s right to do so. Personally, I would love to work in a company with ‘masculine energy.’ To plunge into the clichés, he could mean cutthroat and merciless, lunchtime arm wrestles and willy-swinging competitions, maybe actual shooting range target practice and MMA ‘team-building’ sessions, lunches of only red meat, protein shakes (or red meat protein shakes) and coffee with melted butter. Some of you will be more familiar with the more British version, office floors exchanging shouty ‘bants,’ copious lunchtime, after work, cheeky bottom-drawer booze-bonding and ‘man-up’ ‘mickey-taking.’ Maybe it’s like a dating app office I once went for a meeting at where there were photos of naked women on the walls, and the only female employees in hundreds were the high-heeled hot receptionists. (They wanted to attract more women to the app, hence my being invited to help them. Lol). Or maybe it’s more like the now disgraced fast-fashion mogul who I saw in a meeting publicly berate every member of his staff, including his son, before slipping his hand too far down my back a number of times on the way out. Or the ‘masculine energy’ I first experienced at work was when I worked for my dad in the school holidays from the age of eight. I valeted the cars he bought written off and did up, or we did painting and decorating. I worked 8-4pm every day and got £5 a week (and a daily fry up at a truck caff) for the pleasure. His masculine energy mainly meant being tight and saying very little of anything. Later, I experienced the ‘masculine energy’ of working in a very rough estate pub (underage at 16), where I was placed in the middle of the daily fights to ensure they’d stop as “nobody would punch the little blonde girl.” I learned how to deal with perving, leering, requests to take photos of my feet for a fetish mag, filthy comments constantly sprinkled around the commonplace violence. Advertisement When I ran my own pub at 20 (the youngest landlady the company ever had), the ‘masculine energy’ came from every delivery man who asked for the manager, incredulous and low-key furious it could be me. In advertising, the ‘masculine energy’ was different. This was a professional office environment, so the aggression was passive, with each of the three founders hating and trying to undermine each other in more sophisticated ways than pinning each other up against the toilet cistern. We collected their drugs from the local butcher along with the sausage roll order, and that helped fuel the ‘masculine energy’ nicely (while I was being sent laminated sticky photos of myself from a stalker who worked in the neighboring offices). In fact, Mark’s right, ‘feminine energy’ actually only really hit when I started work at Meta back in 2016. Sheryl seemed equally in charge, women were encouraged to ‘lean in’, they were respected and in positions of power, and people seemed to care about soft skills and the welfare of the workforce not just stock price. Advertisement One of my early managers, an American powerhouse of ambition mixed with kindness was something totally new to me then. My male manager was the same. He was understanding, he listened, he had empathy and a heart. And as a result, we felt valued, worked harder, and smarter. So weird, right? So when I say I would love to work in a company with ‘masculine energy,’ I guess I mean like the men I know and respect most. The masculinity that’s secure in itself enough to champion other people, women included. Or that’s fully-rounded enough to prioritize his family and home life and doesn’t ‘leave it all to the wife.’ That’s mature enough to only take the credit that’s due to them, rather than stealing glory or ideas from others. Or that’s brave enough to want to learn from people different from themselves. Or that’s worldly enough to listen as well as speak. Or that’s wise enough to know that gendering ‘energy’ is pretty old-fashioned in modern workplaces anyway. It’s not revolutionary to say that all the most successful workplaces are mixed. Mixed genders, backgrounds, skills, experiences, cultures, ambitions and styles. Yes, I’m going to throw you some actual provable data here (not my usual creative tack), but surely a ‘masculine energy’ thing to do is prove out a theory, right? Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team. Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum. McKinsey’s Diversity Wins series has consistently found that companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity in executive teams tend to outperform peers. Its 2019 analysis showed companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile. Credit Suisse Research Institute studied over 3,000 companies and found that organizations with at least one female board member had higher returns on equity and better stock performance than those with all-male boards. Boston Consulting Group analyzed 1,700 companies and found that those with above-average diversity in management produced innovation revenue that was 19% higher than companies with below-average leadership diversity. So, maybe the most powerful and effective ‘masculine energy’ thing to do should be to hire hugely diverse teams across all levels to ensure your company’s success. And if you want to do the arm wrestles and willy-swinging while you do, that’s fine; the rest of us can look on a laugh and maybe suggest a therapist to help your flailing insecurities.

Title: GE Vernova hits new record high as RBC says Trump's order 'not impactful'

Investing.com -- GE Vernova's shares hit a new intraday high of over $407 on Tuesday, bolstered by investor confidence despite recent political developments. RBC Capital analysts reaffirmed their Outperform rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, emphasizing that President Trump's recent executive order on wind leasing and permitting is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company. The executive order temporarily bans offshore wind energy leases within the Outer Continental Shelf and pauses the issuance of new or renewed permits for onshore and offshore wind projects on federal lands, pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. However, RBC noted that only about 5% of the total utility-scale wind energy capacity in the U.S. comes from facilities on public lands. "We do not believe the executive order is of material significance," RBC analysts wrote. "We do not believe the announcement will have a material impact on GEV, given the limited exposure to offshore wind in the U.S. and limited onshore wind development on Federal land." The executive order aligns with President Trump's campaign promises to foster a reliable energy economy, citing legal deficiencies as the rationale for the ban. Despite this, RBC maintains a neutral sentiment on the broader implications for GE Vernova and reiterated its price target of $376 ib the stock.

January 21, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Resilinc Resilinc MILPITAS, CA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Resilinc, the leading provider of supply chain resiliency solutions, is sharing exclusive new data revealing the top drivers of supply chain disruptions for 2024. The data compiled by Resilinc’s EventWatchAI, a 24/7 risk monitoring database, reveals that overall disruptions to global supply chains increased 38% from the previous year. The top five disruptions for 2024 include: Factory fires maintained their position as the number one disruption for the sixth consecutive year, with 2,299 disruption alerts issued. Fortunately, this number is down 20% from the previous year and has declined 36% from the record high in 2022. Labor disruptions made it into the top five list for the second year in a row, jumping up to the second spot with a 47% year-over-year increase. Labor issues played a major role in impacting most industries in the U.S. and globally, including company and site-level strikes, national strikes, labor protests, and layoffs. From the ILA U.S. port strike, impacting over 47,000 workers, and the Canadian rail strike to major layoffs at tech giants Intel, Dell, and Amazon, labor disruptions continued its streak as a key risk area for 2024. Financial risk areas, including business sales, leadership transitions, and mergers and acquisitions, rounded out the top five disruptions for 2024. While business sales climbed a steady 17% YoY, leadership transitions surged 95% last year. Several notable transitions included leadership changes at Boeing, Nestlé, Pfizer Limited, and Intel. While mergers and acquisitions saw a slight decline of 5%, they remained a top disruption for 2024. Though the number of disruption alerts increased overall, several risk areas experienced substantial year-over-year increases; for example, extreme weather jumped a dramatic 119%. Consistent with this trend, flood-related alerts surged by 214%, forest fires increased by 88%, and hurricanes/typhoons jumped by 101%, underscoring the growing impact of extreme weather risks. Other noteworthy trends highlighted in the data include a 146% rise in labor violations such as forced labor, poor working conditions, and health and safety violations, among others. Geopolitical risk alerts climbed 123% after a brief dip in 2023, and protests/riots saw an astounding 285% YoY increase, marking the largest growth increase of all risk events tracked by Resilinc. Regulatory change alerts, which include tariffs, changes in laws, environmental regulations, and bans, continued their upward trend with a 128% YoY increase. The five most disrupted industries included Life Sciences, Healthcare, General Manufacturing, High Tech, and Automotive, marking the fourth year in a row that these particular industries have been the most impacted. Of all the 22,522 EventWatchAI notifications sent, more than half (59%) were impactful enough to trigger the creation of a WarRoom—virtual platforms in the Resilinc dashboard where customers and their suppliers communicate and collaborate to assess and resolve disruptions—emphasizing that disruptions not only increased in 2024 but also had a heightened impact on global supply chains. Resilinc’s data is gathered by its 24/7 global event monitoring Artificial Intelligence, EventWatch AI, which collects information and monitors news on 400 different types of disruptions across 104 million sources including traditional news sources, social media platforms, wire services, videos, and government reports.

Title: Indie Agencies Seek a Competitive Edge as Talent Rejects WPP Office Mandate

Time Published: 2025-01-21T11:00:00Z

The stage is set! Advertisers, don't miss this cultural moment. ADWEEK House The Big Game is headed to New Orleans on February 7. RSVP. WPP made a bold move last week as the first major company in the ad industry to mandate that its 100,000-plus employees around the globe must return to the office four days per week. Five years on from the pandemic, there are legitimate reasons to return. Following in the footsteps of other major corporations, from Amazon to Toyota, WPP executives are eager to increase productivity, strengthen culture, and utilize dormant office space. But the decision has gotten under the skin of many employees who thrive working remotely or in a hybrid role, who have caregiving responsibilities at home—or who simply don’t appreciate being told where to work. A petition started by WPP employees on Change.org pushing back on the mandate has garnered more than 16,000 signatures so far. WPP is not the only holding company to enforce a return to office. Publicis employees were told to return three days per week, and dozens were laid off late last year for violating the policy. But none have pushed the mandate beyond three days in-person. That’s in contrast to big clients including JPMorgan Chase, Google, IBM, Apple, and Uber, which have ordered workers back to the office full time, with some threatening job cuts for non-compliance. Undoubtedly, the aggressive mandate will push some WPP staffers to seek job alternatives that are more flexible—and agencies who promote those policies may reap the rewards. “A-plus talent has choice,” Jared Belsky, CEO of independent media agency Acadia, told ADWEEK. “They want to work where they feel empowered and trusted. It’s hard to say ‘we trust you’ and then say ‘we are checking your badges to make sure you are here four times per week.’” Scott Brandon, CEO at agency Brandon, said that WPP’s policy reflects an old-school approach in an industry that thrives on evolution. “Rigid mandates risk alienating top performers who know their best work isn’t tied to a cubicle,” he said. “The backlash here isn’t surprising—people are looking for agencies that prioritize results and culture over arbitrary rules.” Jeff Levick, CEO of We Are Rosie, a fully remote company which offers brands flexible agency staffing, added that most return to office policies come from the CFO to justify expenses—but that creatives often work best with flexibility. Kandi Gongora, chief transformation and people officer at Goodway Group, added that office mandates will also limit holding companies from being able to hire the best talent across the country. “This ultimately leads to unsatisfied, unproductive employees in search of greater autonomy and far less access to incredible talent that exists outside of geographical barriers,” she said. While there are viable reasons for people to be in the office, agencies should prioritize those most impactful moments for people to come in, whether that’s to meet with clients, brainstorm with their teams, pitch new business, or build camaraderie, said Andrew Graff, CEO of independent agency Allen & Gerritson (A&G). Mandates must also be thought through carefully, particularly for agencies that downsized office space during the pandemic. WPP staffers are already grumbling about where they will work, as available desks and meeting rooms may be at a minimum, according The Drum. These are all kinks WPP will have to work out as it works through the logistics of an office return. Sasha Martens, founder of Sasha the Mensch, an international headhunting firm, believes independents stand to benefit most from WPP’s mandate, as staffers worry other holding companies will follow suit. “You’re more likely going to see some of the bigger companies say four days a week as well. What that does is open the door for more flexible and independent companies,” Martens told ADWEEK. With Omnicom’s takeover of IPG also spooking talent in fear of layoffs and priority changes, independent agencies could have an advantage. Indeed, Belsky said Acadia has “already seen resumes starting to trickle in, and I would predict we see more.” Levick agrees that flexible businesses like its own will benefit, as We Are Rosie has seen an uptick in resumes in response to return-to-office mandates in the past. “We’re entering this new marketplace where people can decide how they want to work, and if they want to go to the office,” he said. Agencies say a return to office will foster the creative alchemy that happens when teams work together in person. But those who are flexible can still come together with intention , without telling employees what to do. A&G redesigned its offices in Boston and Philadelphia with an eye on flexibility and community for that reason, inviting community members to share the space with it. “Your first space is your home. Your second space is the office. And the third space are those places where you gather and be social but still may conduct business,” said CEO Andrew Graff. “For an industry that is about creativity, I would think we could be a little bit more creative on how we think about these policies or mandates.” Agencies are businesses, and real estate is a substantial investment that they must justify. But disengaged talent can be just as costly in terms of lost innovation, diminished morale, and turnover. “The future of our industry isn’t about going back to the way things were—it’s about finding sustainable solutions that support strong outcomes and a workplace that works for everyone, wherever they are,” said Brooks Luquire, CEO at agency Luquire. Though “human interactions breed creativity,” according to Devin Reiter, president at agency Fortnight Collective, and most agencies are looking for some level of return, flexibility is now a big differentiator. “What the industry needs is balance,” said John Geletka, CXO and founder of Gelekta+. “People need to work together, and work hard, but then need the room after long nights of work to get some home-time and take care of their lives.” Study: Ad Agencies’ Return-to-Office Mandates Pose Hiring and Retention Challenges Kyle O’Brien is a staff reporter for Adweek and editor of AgencySpy.

Title: What To Expect From Bank Of America Stock In 2025?

Bank of America branch office, exterior view, New York City, New York, USA. (Photo by: GHI-Plexi ... [+] Images/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Bank of America’s stock (NYSE: BAC) posted a better-than-expected set of Q4 2024 earnings, led by stronger investment banking business and higher net interest income. Net profits more than doubled year-over-year to $6.67 billion, or $0.82 per share, while revenues were up 15% to $25.5 billion. Net interest income - the difference in between the interest banks earn on loans and pay for deposits - was up by 3% to $14.5 billion, coming in slightly ahead of estimates. The investment banking business was a particularly strong performer over Q4, with fees up 44% to $1.65 billion. Mergers and acquisitions activity has picked up from nearly a decade-low in 2023. Companies have also been focusing on issuing more debt and equity capital. Sales and trading revenue were up 10% over the quarter, with equities up 6% while fixed income, currencies, and commodities were up by an even stronger 13%. The broader U.S. banking sector has been faring well this earnings season led by rising stock markets which helped trading activity, softer interest rates, stronger dealmaking activity, and general positivity about the economy. For instance, Bank of America’s rival JPMorgan just reported record annual profits for 2024, while Goldman Sachs has also seen profits pick up after witnessing a post-Covid lull. Separately, in the cryptocurrency world, see Solana Price To $400 Next? The increase in BAC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -24% in 2022, 5% in 2023, and 34% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BAC face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Looking ahead, things could get better. Higher interest rates in recent years weighed on lenders as they had to pay more interest to depositors. However, with the Fed easing rates since September, we could see this softening in the near term helping drive up loan demand while lowering the costs of deposits. Bank of America expects NII of as much as $14.6 billion for Q1 2025 and has indicated that the metric could grow sequentially every quarter this year, reaching as much as $15.7 billion by Q4. NII is an important metric for Bank Of America, as it has a large deposit base compared to rivals. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could directly boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Bank Of America. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking and M&A-related activity. Additionally, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Overall, at its current price of $47 per share, BAC is trading around the Trefis’ estimate for Bank of America’s valuation.

Title: The race for the next Ozempic is on

Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Two recent disappointing clinical trials of highly-anticipated weight-loss drugs have made it clear that it is too early to crown any winners in the race for the next generation of anti-obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) CagriSema and Amgen’s (AMGN) MariTide both fell short of an expected 25% average weight-loss target in late-stage trials late last year, leaving investors frustrated and sending their stock prices tumbling. These setbacks have left the door wide open for other pharmaceutical companies racing to develop more potent weight-loss drugs. But it’s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market. These medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm — especially in the United States. Popularized by Ozempic, these treatments mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss effects. Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound. The weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years. Morgan Stanley (MS) projects the global market for these treatments could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population — 31.5 million people — are expected to be using them by 2035. With that much money at stake, it’s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow. Several pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections — an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound. Novo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication. Eli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks. “Retatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),” president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss. Amgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a “convenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.” Viking Therapeutics (VKTX): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment. Zealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea — one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight. Pharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages. Novo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It’s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results. Eli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill — orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial — its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. Pfizer (PFE): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects. Viking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk’s amycretin. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Corporate America, including TECH GIANTS and BIG PHARMA, opens wallets wide for Trump’s second inauguration â contributing over $170 million to shatter previous record

Corporate America has contributed unprecedented sums, exceeding $170 million, to Donald Trump's second inauguration, marking a significant shift in business relationships with the president. Major corporations, including tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft, as well as auto manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies, have increased their donations,Â some more than tripling their contributions from previous inaugurations. The surge in donations reflects a change in corporate America's view of Trump, moving from initial skepticism to a desire to curry favor with the unpredictable but influential figure.

The record-breaking fundraising underscores a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in a polarized political landscape, with businesses seeking influence and access in the new administration. The record-breaking fundraising underscores a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in a polarized political landscape, with businesses seeking influence and access in the new administration. Corporate America has poured unprecedented sums into President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony and related events, signaling a dramatic shift in the business world's relationship with the polarizing political figure. According to the New York Times, Trump's inaugural committee has raised more than $170 million, shattering the previous record set during his first inauguration in 2017. This surge in donations reflects a calculated effort by major corporations to curry favor with a man known for his unpredictability and penchant for rewarding loyalty â or punishing perceived slights. Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft, along with CEOs from Apple and OpenAI, are among the top contributors. Auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and financial firms have also opened their checkbooks, with many publicly announcing their donations months before federal disclosure requirements kick in. This marks a stark contrast to Trump's first inauguration, when corporate America approached him with skepticism, and to the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when many companies distanced themselves from him. The record-breaking fundraising haul underscores a significant change in how corporate America views Trump. During his first campaign and presidency, many companies were hesitant to align themselves with a figure whose rhetoric and policies often sparked controversy. However, eight years later, businesses appear to have adapted to Trump's transactional style of governance. "The stigma of a Trump donation, which was out there to some degree eight years ago, is no longer there," said Brian Ballard, a longtime Trump fundraiser who has helped raise money for the Presidential Inaugural Committee. "Who knows what's going to happen two months from now? But for today, up and down, corporate America is solidly pro-Trump." This shift is evident in the size and transparency of the donations. Microsoft, for example, contributed $1 million â doubling its donations for Trump's 2017 and former President Joe Biden's 2021 inaugurations. Google, which gave $285,000 to both Trump's first inauguration and Biden's, more than tripled its contribution to $1 million this time. Big names, big checks The list of donors reads like a who's who of corporate America. Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft each contributed at least $1 million, as did the CEOs of Apple and OpenAI. Auto manufacturers Toyota, Ford and General Motors also donated $1 million a piece, alongside pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, telehealth company Hims & Hers, and tax service Intuit. Robinhood, the stock trading app, contributed $2 million. (Related: A strategic investment: Meta donates $1M to Trump inauguration fund.) In a sign of how eager these companies are to publicize their support, spokespeople for many firms quickly confirmed their donations to Politico. Chevron and Bank of America also acknowledged contributions but declined to specify amounts. "Everyone's trying to kiss the ring and curry favor with the new administration," said a healthcare lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. "We're hopeful this new administration will be friendlier than the previous one." The surge in donations reflects a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in an increasingly polarized political landscape. Trump's second inauguration comes amid ongoing legal battles, including felony convictions and promises to pardon participants in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Yet, these controversies have done little to deter corporate America from seeking influence with the incoming administration. The record-breaking fundraising for Trump's second inauguration highlights the evolving relationship between corporate America and the president. Once viewed with skepticism, Trump is now seen as a figure whose favor is worth courting, even at a high price. For businesses, the donations represent a calculated investment in access and influence, as well as an acknowledgment of Trump's enduring impact on American politics.

DNC fundraiser now critical of party's "$1 billion disaster" of a presidential campaign. Trump to sign executive order designating cryptocurrency as a national priority on inauguration day. Sources include: ZeroHedge.com Statista.com Politico.com Brighteon.com According to the New York Times, Trump's inaugural committee has raised more than $170 million, shattering the previous record set during his first inauguration in 2017. This surge in donations reflects a calculated effort by major corporations to curry favor with a man known for his unpredictability and penchant for rewarding loyalty â or punishing perceived slights. Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft, along with CEOs from Apple and OpenAI, are among the top contributors. Auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and financial firms have also opened their checkbooks, with many publicly announcing their donations months before federal disclosure requirements kick in. This marks a stark contrast to Trump's first inauguration, when corporate America approached him with skepticism, and to the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when many companies distanced themselves from him. The record-breaking fundraising haul underscores a significant change in how corporate America views Trump. During his first campaign and presidency, many companies were hesitant to align themselves with a figure whose rhetoric and policies often sparked controversy. However, eight years later, businesses appear to have adapted to Trump's transactional style of governance. "The stigma of a Trump donation, which was out there to some degree eight years ago, is no longer there," said Brian Ballard, a longtime Trump fundraiser who has helped raise money for the Presidential Inaugural Committee. "Who knows what's going to happen two months from now? But for today, up and down, corporate America is solidly pro-Trump." This shift is evident in the size and transparency of the donations. Microsoft, for example, contributed $1 million â doubling its donations for Trump's 2017 and former President Joe Biden's 2021 inaugurations. Google, which gave $285,000 to both Trump's first inauguration and Biden's, more than tripled its contribution to $1 million this time. Big names, big checks The list of donors reads like a who's who of corporate America. Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft each contributed at least $1 million, as did the CEOs of Apple and OpenAI. Auto manufacturers Toyota, Ford and General Motors also donated $1 million a piece, alongside pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, telehealth company Hims & Hers, and tax service Intuit. Robinhood, the stock trading app, contributed $2 million. (Related: A strategic investment: Meta donates $1M to Trump inauguration fund.) In a sign of how eager these companies are to publicize their support, spokespeople for many firms quickly confirmed their donations to Politico. Chevron and Bank of America also acknowledged contributions but declined to specify amounts. "Everyone's trying to kiss the ring and curry favor with the new administration," said a healthcare lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. "We're hopeful this new administration will be friendlier than the previous one." The surge in donations reflects a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in an increasingly polarized political landscape. Trump's second inauguration comes amid ongoing legal battles, including felony convictions and promises to pardon participants in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Yet, these controversies have done little to deter corporate America from seeking influence with the incoming administration. The record-breaking fundraising for Trump's second inauguration highlights the evolving relationship between corporate America and the president. Once viewed with skepticism, Trump is now seen as a figure whose favor is worth courting, even at a high price. For businesses, the donations represent a calculated investment in access and influence, as well as an acknowledgment of Trump's enduring impact on American politics.

Title: Origin Materials, Inc. (ORGN) Stock: The Under-the-Radar Stock Poised for Massive Upside in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) stands against other under-the-radar stocks. Investing in under-the-radar stocks can be a savvy move for those looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially reap significant rewards. These lesser-known companies often fly under the radar of mainstream investors, which can result in undervalued stock prices. Under-the-radar stocks can be found in various sectors, from emerging technologies to niche industries, and are often characterized by their small market capitalization, limited analyst coverage, and low trading volumes. According to Business Insider, several lesser-known hedge funds have outperformed the market, Glen Kacher’s Light Street and David Rogers’ Castle Hook, for instance, returned 60% last year, outpacing many of their more prominent peers. Jason Mudrick’s firm also had a strong year, with returns of over 31%. Meanwhile, the largest hedge funds in the world, such as Citadel, D.E. Shaw, and Millennium, had good years, although most failed to match the S&P 500’s 23% gain. The impressive returns achieved by lesser-known hedge funds can be attributed to their bold investment strategies, which included a focus on under-the-radar stocks. By investing in these hidden gems, these funds were able to capitalize on undervalued opportunities and reap significant rewards. As a result, these under-the-radar stocks proved to be a key factor in the funds’ success.

In an interview with Bloomberg on January 18, David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, shared his outlook for US equities, forecasting an 11% upside for the S&P 500 index, based on the expectation that earnings per share will grow around 11% in calendar 2025 and 7% in calendar 2026. Kostin emphasized that equity investors are already looking ahead, with the fourth-quarter earnings season about to kick off, Kostin noted that earnings growth for the quarter is expected to be around 8%, but the strong dollar may lead to fewer positive surprises than in previous years. Kostin highlighted that the US stock market is trading at a high multiple, around 22-23 times forward earnings, which is historically high. As a result, earnings will be the primary driver of the market, rather than multiple expansion. He expects the S&P 500 index to rise to around 6,500, driven by earnings growth. Kostin also cautioned that a higher bond yield environment is a concern, as it has been a headwind for equities in the past. However, Kostin expects that inflation will come down slowly, and bond yields will fall to around 4.25% over the rest of the year. Kostin suggested that portfolio managers should focus on owning US companies with domestically driven revenues, rather than those with high export exposure. This is because companies with high domestic sales are less likely to be affected by retaliatory tariffs. Kostin also mentioned that the Magnificent Seven companies have significant sales outside the US, and may face potential risks due to their high export exposure. Kostin acknowledged that the Magnificent Seven companies have had fantastic stock performances in 2023 and 2024. However, he expects their premium earnings growth to narrow substantially in 2025 and 2026, leading to a narrowing excess return. As a result, Kostin favors mid-cap stocks, which trade at lower multiples and have similar growth rates to large-cap stocks. He believes that mid-cap US equities, with a market capitalization of between $5 billion to $20 billion, offer a better risk-reward profile. Lesser-known, under-the-radar companies are often overlooked by mainstream investors, but present a unique potential for growth, particularly in sectors poised for innovation and transformation.

To compile our list of the 10 under-the-radar stocks with massive upside for 2025, we sifted through internet rankings to find 30 under-the-radar stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of January 17. We also included their stock price as of January 17 and their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Netflix earnings preview: Sports to boost Q4 results as analysts debate future price hikes

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close. Analysts expect the streamer to deliver strong results after it ended the year with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson" boxing match, and the return of "Squid Game." Netflix stock has stumbled since the start of the year after finishing 2024 at record highs. The stock pullback comes as macroeconomic uncertainties have weighed broadly on megacap Big Tech. Here's what Wall Street expects for the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $10.11 billion (Netflix's guidance: $10.13 billion) versus $8.83 billion in Q4 2023 Earnings per share: $4.18 (Netflix's guidance: $4.23) versus $2.11 in Q4 2023 Net subscriber additions: 9.18 million versus 13.12 million in Q4 2023 "There are very high expectations going into this quarter," Geetha Ranganathan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program. "But it's really the perfect setup for Netflix." Ranganathan called out the company's solid content slate, describing it as "one of their strongest quarters ever," as live sports programming dominated the platform. Notably, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day game ever in the US. "It's going to be really interesting to see how [sports] shapes the future of Netflix," Ranganathan said, adding the recent debut of WWE Raw will drive further growth and retention. "This is really the big shift we're going to see this quarter," she said. "That's going to drive subscriber momentum for Netflix in a big way. We're expecting well over 10 million subscriber additions." This will be the last earnings report in Netflix's history revealing net subscriber figures. The company announced last spring it would stop reporting the metric at the start of this year. Investors have recognized the company's efforts over the past year, which, in addition to a strong content slate, have included more advertising successes. According to its latest update, Netflix's ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users. The stock has surged about 80% year over year. It hit several all-time highs in 2024, as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company revealed in its latest biannual viewership report that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "We've been expecting a price increase in the US market for quite a while now," Ranganathan said. "They're definitely long overdue." The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience. Valuation has also been a concern, with analysts expecting a downward revision to the company's 2025 revenue outlook, due, in part, to the strengthening dollar. Currently, Netflix anticipates revenue growth between 11% and 13%, a slowdown from last year's 15% growth rate. "I think they'll temper those revenue growth projections," Ranganathan predicted. "But I think the way that they offset that is with a big price increase, which could happen anytime this year." Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

All the major indices are set to continue their optimism from last week, when the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all reported gains of over 3.7%. Even though the S&P had hardly moved from its early November levels when the election happened, many mega-cap stocks continue to register 52-week highs. We looked at some of these stocks and why they are expected to continue surging up with the earnings season already underway. To come up with our list of 10 mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs, we only considered stocks that have recently hit their 52-week highs and have a market cap of at least $150 billion. A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo. JPMorgan Chase and Co. is a global financial services provider. It operates in asset & wealth management, consumer and community banking, and commercial & investment banking segments. The bank has shown a strong upward trend in the previous year with a gain of 55%. The reason for this optimism is the company’s recently announced Q4 performance. It exceeded the expected revenue for Q4 by $1.21 billion. Additionally, GAAP EPS was also higher ($4.81) than expected ($4.10). The Fixed-Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) trading Outperformed this quarter, clocking in at $5.01 billion, surpassing the expected $4.37 billion mark. The bank’s book value per share was up 11% while tangible book value per share was up 13% y/y. The net interest income of the bank was down 3% as compared to the previous year, but it still managed to exceed estimates. The strong performance of the company as well as continuous gain in the stock’s price for the whole year continues to deliver strong results for investors. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Can The Washington Post save itself?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Staffers plead with Jeff Bezos amidst a talent exodus The Washington Post is one of the most storied organizations in American journalism. But it is in crisis, losing reporting talent, suffering a loss of readers and facing a staff rebellion against publisher Will Lewis. The Post has been swamped by "one debacle after another," since Lewis took charge of the newspaper a year ago, said NPR. The decision by the owner (and billionaire Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos to cancel the Post's traditional presidential endorsement in an apparent effort to placate newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump was a huge blow, causing "hundreds of thousands of subscribers" to cancel their subscriptions. Layoffs have led to fewer journalists on the job, contributing to plummeting morale that led some of the survivors to flee for jobs elsewhere. A "clear vision" to put the Post back on track to journalistic and financial success remains "elusive," said NPR. More than 400 Post staffers last week sent a letter to Bezos asking him to "get personally involved to turn the paper back in the right direction," said Poynter. The staffers said in the letter they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions" that caused readers to bolt. They asked for a face-to-face meeting with Bezos in the service of "restoring trust that has been lost." Bezos did not immediately reply. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. Bezos has "plunged my beloved Washington Post into darkness," said Eleanor Clift at The Daily Beast. Post reporters have done a "first-rate job covering Trump," but Bezos' decision to pacify the incoming president (with the non-endorsement, as well Amazon's $40 million expense on a documentary about Melania Trump) has raised the specter their journalism could be "compromised by anything that could damage Bezos' financial interests." Bezos' decision to get on Trump's good side "has ramifications far beyond the Post newsroom." If the Post is to remain viable, it must "retain, not lose, its talent," Margaret Sullivan said at The Guardian. It's not "unreasonable to question" whether the Post can maintain its independence in the Trump era, and "Bezos may not care." But if he does care, he should "show up — soon" in the newsroom to talk to reporters, and recommit to the "importance of editorial freedom." He should also dump Lewis, who has overseen a rapid decline in the Post's standing. For the sake of both journalism and "democracy itself, I sure hope he finds a way to do it." On the eve of Trump's inauguration, the Post unveiled a new mission statement: "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The slogan is intended as an "internal rallying point for employees," said The New York Times. And the paper's chief strategy officer has announced a goal of reaching 200 million paying users. That's an audacious target: The Post currently has fewer than 3 million digital subscribers.

Title: Content Americas 2025: The Confab’s No. 1 Question, a Movie Renaissance, What Buyers Want, Brazil and Deals to Date
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/content-americas-key-themes-and-major-takeaways-1236279425/

By John Hopewell Chief International Correspondent MIAMI — The best thing about the Miami Hilton Downtown is its vistas from above Biscayne Bay and opposite the city’s iconic serried strip of high-rises. Delegates at Content Americas, which begins its third edition this Monday, will be hoping that the market will afford an equally panoramic view of the international TV business. That’s crucial. Few areas of the world became so dependent on global platform investment as Latin America during the pandemic. Bucking worldwide trends, series season orders actually soared in Spain over 2024, shooting up from 43 a year earlier to 75, according to Ampere Analysis. “Content Americas is the first TV event of the year and, therefore, an opportunity to test, by talking to folks, your incoming hypotheses about how market trends will play out,” says Gaumont USA’s Christian Gabela. Related Stories VIP+ A Decade of Data Supports Sports’ Domination of Broadcast TV Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni Feud: 'A Pure PR Play' With Real Legal Stakes As of Sunday, participation sits at just short of 2,000 delegates and 175 exhibitors, edging up from compared to 2024. Popular on Variety That slight increase reflects the fact that, when it comes to Latin America, most all players have attended from last, with Content Americas serving as both a market and production meet, connecting major players from Latin America, the U.S. Hispanic and Spain. Some urgent, specific questions need answering. One case in point: After across-the-board top exec layoffs and departures, effective from December, how will Televisa-Univisión streaming service ViX handle acquisitions? The big question delegates hope Content Americas will address echoes across the world: After a severe corrective in 2023, will global TV streamers in any way be back in the saddle driving growth in Latin America? Don’t Expect Easy Answers Content Americas attendees shouldn’t expect easy answers. “Global streamers are still in different phases — some are consolidating, some are driving toward profitability, and some are business as usual. It’s hard to know what the next year will look like. This unpredictability represents a challenging time for producers,” says Erik Barmack at L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content. Sales cycles have slowed dramatically after the launch of original production across the region, from Netflix’s “Club of Crows” in 2015 to Paramount+ and HBO Max service bows in 2021. 2024: As Bad As It Gets? There is a dire need for visibility, however. Some stats set to be fired off at Content Americas will make for startling viewing. In 2022, major global streamers – Netflix, Amazon, Apple, WBD, Disney, Comcast and Paramount – made 69 season orders in Brazil. By 2024, that figure was down to 28. Mexico’s 49 commissions in 2022 plunged 27% to 36 in 2024. Given global streamers have been the fundamental industry driver of recent years – and lifeboat in 2020 – their corrective plays out over the whole industry. One-year results, however, can be hugely misleading. In some countries, such as Brazil with Globo, incumbents are still highly important. One bottom line is that buoyed by ad tiers, SVOD players will continue to grow their subscription bases in Latin America, Netflix from 51 million in 2024 to 69.5 million in 2029, Omdia predicts. Some established players, such as NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, look bullish on production growth. Its chairman, Luis Fernández, will deliver one of the most awaited keynotes at this year’s Content Americas. “At a time when Telemundo is the most-watched network in prime time, we are super-charging our scripted content production under one strong brand: Telemundo Studios,” Fernández told Variety last April. A Stabler Market The bottom line, per industry consensus, however, is that far fewer originals will be produced in Latin America in the future compared to the explosion of orders in the recent past. Producers hope, at least, that the market will settle. “2024 was clearly a year where streamers’ budgets for “originals” became increasingly under pressure,” says Gabela. “Our hope is that there’s greater stability in that regard in 2025.” Ringing the Changes “Stabler” is another way of suggesting that, of course, money will be tight throughout the industry. So the story of 2025’s Content Americas may well be producers’ and distributors’ reactions to that. “Independents need to be creative now about financing plans that incorporate multiple territories, to be clever about understanding public funds and the general ecosystems in particular markets,” says Barmack. There are some more obvious ways forward that are already on the radar. “Last year, as streamers cut back on commissioning projects, co-production and windowing became the talk of the town. In 2025, I think we’ll see more of those conversations materialize into deals as the industry readjusts,” says Gabela. “Fewer originals means the need for more co-productions and invites us to be creative to find the financing,” agrees EO Media’s Eze Olzanski. Movies: A TV Industry Future At least in the English-speaking world, there’s a kind of rebound in films from A24, Blumhouse, and Neon with “Longlegs” and “Terrifier,” for example, auteur genre films with talent cast against type. “[Creative] talent can make the difference and become a part of the business equation, and the payoff can be really, really high,” says Fremantle’s Manuel Martí. Gaumont USA, with Pasajero, has produced Netflix’s “The Biggest Fan” with Kate del Castillo as it sets up remakes of its classic film catalog at platforms. The Mediapro Studio has scored one of its most significant hits in 2024 with “El 47,” the frontrunner at February’s Spanish Academy Goya Awards. “I think the sector’s going back in some ways to what it was before,” Olzanski tells Variety, noting that global streamer production is ever more ‘local for local,’ though local may be one territory and fewer projects will be for all Latin America or aim for global.” Selectivity Volume for volume’s sake is a waning philosophy: “Independents need to be pickier, frankly, about projects. Not all of this pullback is bad — it’s forcing higher standards that the industry could use,” Barmack observes. Olzanski agrees. “The industry is finding its new balance, understanding its current size, how much it can produce and sell, and working for that size. It’s a moment of honesty for the industry.” “Reducing the number of productions and releases, particularly releases, might seem a bad thing, but on the positive side, gives more visibility and value to launches,” he adds. What Will Buyers Be Buying? There was a time – broadly last decade – when experiments ran wild at pay-TV operators and an early Netflix. From the turn of this decade broadly, a pivot occurred: “Creators are working with known genres and frameworks and then trying to reinvent them,” Berlinale Series head Julia Fidel noted in 2022. Now, “series are genre layering, layering one genre on top of another,” said Fremantle’s Manuel Marti. One part political exposé, another part espionage thriller, “Yosi, The Regretful Spy,” whose Season 2 competes for a Rose d’Or Latino, is one case in point. Another contender, the Natalia Beristáin showrun “Midnight Family,” from Fremantle and Fabula, melds a reality-sourced medical thriller and family drama. Series, Martí points out, will remain plot-driven, “making you want to see the whole season,” and character-driven, “making you come again for the second season.” Character-driven drama is, moreover, on the rise. “I guess at the Emmys, both ‘Shogun’ and ‘The Bear’ were character-driven, which is what people especially crave,” Martí observes. More Buyer Interests Beyond that, “Regular, returnable and franchiseable content will be the most attractive,” says Ampere’s Fred Black. “Particularly crime dramas, which work globally and are produced internationally.” On distribution, apart from the more relevant new launches, buyers are moving ever more into non-exclusive deals, says Olzanski. On the local side, “we’ve gone back to a more normal thing with the usual slots for television: Action, natural disasters, a family, kids, co-viewing, and so on,” he adds. The production of fewer originals doesn’t mean that streamers will be acquiring more, he cautioned, “and that is part of finding the new balance.” Brazil “Thanks to the global presence of the streamers, Brazilian producers’ content has been watched outside the country, which was great for them, and now they want more. Being in such a huge market, having success abroad is a newly acquired desire, not necessarily a need,” says Martí. Also, he notes that global streamers look set to be obliged to invest a percentage of gross revenues in Brazilian content. Content Americas 2025 takes place, also, as “I’m Still Here” scored a best actress award for Fernanda Torres and “Senna,” praised for its production values, has played in Netflix’s global Top 10 non-English TV charts. It’s a special moment for the international industry to see Brazil as a key production center,” says Luis Toledo, the former highly active Spcine exec, who is launching Filomena Productions to connect Brazil, Latin America and the global South with established international markets. “This is exactly the reason for creating Filomena. To “prove” or guarantee to the more developed film markets that the global South can deliver the same quality but with lower prices and also new stories/narratives. The world can’t stand watching ‘Fast and Furious’ number 156 anymore.” Deals to Date *El Estudio, partnering with L.A.-based Happy Accidents, has acquired adaptation rights to ”Here Come the Habibs,” a fish-out-of-water Australian comedy about a Lebanese family.

Title: Netflix’s Expected Q4 Subscriber Bonanza Should Get Earnings Season Off To A Fast Start
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/01/netflix-q4-2024-earnings-streaming-disney-warner-bros-max-1236259198/

By Dade Hayes Business Editor As is the case with most Netflix earnings reports, the question for the company on Tuesday isn’t whether the number of subscribers will rise – it’s about just how high the number can go. Most Wall Street analysts expect a marked surge in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, driven by the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight, two NFL games and series premieres like Squid Game‘s second season. The report by Netflix, coming on the first full day of President Donald Trump’s second term, will kick off a five-week period of fresh media and tech financial results. The numbers and executive comments, a burst after the annual holiday lull, will offer the first signals about the trajectory of 2025. Related Stories Cancellations and Renewals 'Selling The OC' Renewed For Season 4 At Netflix News Tim McGraw Exits Netflix's Bull Riding Drama Series Due To Surgery Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp. are expected to weigh in on their failed joint streaming venture, Venu Sports, and Comcast will brief Wall Street on progress with NBCUniversal cable network spinoff it announced last November, and Paramount Global will offer updates on the company’s pending merger with Skydance Media. Big Tech leaders will also make their voices heard after flocking to Washington for Trump’s inauguration. Watch on Deadline Netflix is expected to add 8.2 million subscribers in the quarter, reaching 290.9 million, according to the consensus forecast by Wall Street analysts. Given the company’s momentum surging at the end of December, estimates are undergoing upward revision. A survey of 45 buy-side analysts conducted by Guggenheim Securities found that 70% of them are calling for at least 11.1 million net adds in the quarter, and 29% are now north of 13.1 million. This is the last quarter when the streaming leader plans to report subscriber numbers, shifting its emphasis to revenue and operating margin, along with audience metrics like engagement. Tim Nollen of Macquarie believes the timing of the subscriber disclosure end is not accidental. “It is possible subscription growth will slow from here as paid sharing enforcement has largely cycled through,” he wrote in a note to clients, “but a slowing rate of sub growth does not necessarily mean slower growth for the company overall.” Nollen sees the company adding more than 10 million subscribers in the quarter, with “a decent chance” the tally ends up even higher, one reason he upped his 12-month price target on Netflix shares to $965, from $795. Alicia Reese of Wedbush Securities sees the company’s 2-year-old advertising business becoming a primary driver of revenue by 2026. In a recent research note, she maintained her “outperform” rating on Netflix stock at a 12-month target of $950. “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars,” she wrote. “Netflix can retain its moat while competitors try to replicate its business model. … With global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability, Netflix has reached the right formula.” Among the questions Netflix will like face during its self-mediated earnings call (in which its head of investor relations selects and groups analyst queries as opposed to an open conference-call format) concern price hikes, advertising growth and the strategy for live sports. The streaming giant announced just before Christmas that it acquired rights to multiple editions of the FIFA Women’s World Cup, adding to the multi-year NFL relationship launched in 2024. Sports-adjacent WWE Raw also began weekly live airings earlier this month under a multi-year rights deal, adding a potent draw to the ad tier, which is where Netflix is focusing its energy. Disney is executing a similar streaming strategy. With its portfolio finally profitable five years after the launch of flagship Disney+, the company is pushing more customers toward the cheaper, ad-supported option. It also mimicked Netflix’s effort to force anyone sharing passwords to pay for the privilege. Like its media peers, Disney faces a number of other challenges. The L.A. wildfires, which got the year off to a catastrophic start, especially for many entertainment industry workers, will factor into the company’s earnings report even though they broke out after the quarter’s end. In a recent note to clients reaffirming her “buy” rating on Disney but raising some concerns, BofA Securities analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote that it “does not appear the recent LA fires have had a material impact on Disneyland attendance.” Even so, she sees “potential risk” to forecasts for incremental costs due to the need for temporary employee housing and business disruption. The quarter ending 2024, which is officially the first quarter of Disney’s fiscal year, which began last fall, “will be the trough quarter of this fiscal year” for the company’s Experiences division, Ehrlich predicts. The impact of two recent hurricanes, along with cruise ship pre-opening costs, will weigh on results. And then there is Venu, which was scrapped before ever launching. Announced with fanfare in February 2024 by JV partners Disney, Fox and WBD, it was sued on antitrust grounds by pay-TV provider Fubo. As part of a settlement reached this month, Disney said it would acquire 70% of Fubo. All three partners are likely to be asked to quantify their investment in Venu. During the trial, it was revealed that the tab had exceeded $50 million as the streaming offering was designed and staffed by more than 100 employees. Shutdown costs are likely to add millions more at an inopportune time given the austerity drive and cutbacks rippling through the traditional media sector. With a mixed bag including better movie studio results but disappointing NBA ratings and expenses for things like password sharing and other streaming initiatives, Ehrlich sees “several moving parts” and “unknowns” in play for Disney. Big Tech executives at Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, meanwhile, usually keep their strategic cards close to the vest as they report earnings. This time, they will be speaking to investors shortly after gathering together in Washington, D.C. In throwing their support behind President-elect Trump along with major tech figures like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, the companies are hoping to be rewarded for their loyalty. Trump’s first term was marked by combative and acrimonious relations with the companies, many of which ultimately banned him from their platforms. President Biden’s administration has seen a number of regulatory actions aiming to rein in the companies’ power. Despite a parting warning from Biden about the “oligarchs” attempting to influence American democracy, a shared priority has taken shape among tech companies and government officials: making money through innovation. That’s a political message Wall Street can always endorse. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

"Drill Baby Drill!" The signature energy battle cry of Donald Trump has returned to center stage as he returns to the White House. His vision for American energy dominance is taking shape with the nomination of Chris Wright, a vocal advocate for fossil fuels, as his choice for Energy Secretary. Wright, 60, made his position clear during his Senate confirmation hearing last week: "Previous administrations have viewed energy as a liability instead of the immense national asset that it is." His appointment signals a dramatic shift from current energy policies, with a laser focus on expanding domestic production across multiple sectors. The Liberty Energy CEO, who is expected to win Senate confirmation, brings a unique perspective to the role. "To compete globally, we must expand energy production, including commercial nuclear and liquefied natural gas, and cut the cost of energy for Americans," Wright declared during his hearing. His stance represents a stark contrast to the Biden administration's pause on LNG export approvals and restrictions on federal land drilling. The focus on expanded energy production extends beyond the Department of Energy. Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum reinforced this agenda during his confirmation hearing, pledging to vigorously pursue maximizing energy production from U.S. public lands and waters as a national security imperative. His comments signal a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's efforts to limit oil and gas drilling through reduced federal lease auctions and offshore development restrictions aimed at addressing climate change. Wright's vision extends beyond traditional energy sources. As an MIT-trained engineer who studied fusion energy, he supports developing small nuclear power reactors and geothermal energy, while expressing skepticism about the sufficiency of solar and wind power. "The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system," Wright told the Senate energy committee, adding, "Do I wish we could make faster progress, absolutely." This pragmatic approach to energy transition aligns with Trump's broader energy independence agenda. CLEVELAND, OH (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) For investors looking to capitalize on this shift in energy policy, SLB (formerly Schlumberger) presents a compelling opportunity. The company's strong market position was recently highlighted by a 6% surge in its stock price on Friday's trading following better-than-expected Q4 adjusted earnings, driven by robust demand for its drilling equipment and technology. The company's confidence in its future is demonstrated by its dividend increase and announcement of a $2.3 billion stock buyback program. As the largest service provider to the oil and gas industry, SLB's global presence across more than 100 countries positions it uniquely to benefit from expanded domestic energy production. The company's Q4 performance, particularly strong gains in its digital and integration business, showcases its technological leadership and operational efficiency. While the energy sector's cyclical nature presents inherent challenges, SLB's valuation suggest significant upside potential. Trading at less than 11 times earnings with a 3% dividend yield, the stock appears undervalued. SLB's aggressive share buyback program and strong financials, combined with its AI integration and low debt levels, position it well for 2025's expected energy expansion. The company's technological leadership and global scale make it an attractive vehicle for investors looking to capitalize on potential U.S. energy policy shifts. As America moves toward more aggressive domestic production, SLB's comprehensive capabilities position it to play a crucial role in this transformation.

As Games Workshop seeks next success. An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year. A report by MP1st details posts by former employees of a developer known as Thought Pennies - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles. As with many other companies over the years, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO Daniel Erickson posted: "Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding." This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled. One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'. Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game. This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income," Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said last week. In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

Time Published: 2025-01-20T11:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms.

Episode 12 – Bill McDermott steps down from SAP – Commentary and Outlook. SAP pre-announced earnings with a beat and a raise, which acted as a heat shield for the surprise news that long-time CEO Bill McDermott is not renewing his contract. SAP is moving back to a dual-CEO model with a separate customer-facing and product/ops focus for each exec. SAP is strong financially but we believe faces significant technical integration challenges over the next decade, which may have played into McDermott’s and SAP’s decisions. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante shares recent spending data from ETR and lays out some of the challenges SAP faces going forward. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 11 – Spending in Q4 2019 is reverting back to pre-2018 levels – The spending outlook for the balance of 2019, into 2020 is softening, but not falling off a cliff.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante digs into Oracle’s business and lays out his expectation for the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 6 – Spending data from ETR shows that robotic process automation is gaining steam in mid-to-large enterprises – A race to improve productivity is driving companies to implement automation in the form of software robots. UiPath and Automation Anywhere show strong customer spending momentum. Blue Prism and other major players, while not showing the same growth, appear to be well-positioned. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this market is beginning to re-shape automation for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons. Pure Storage is growing faster than the marketshare leaders but from a much smaller installed base. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost.

GE Vernova (GEV) is set to report earnings before the market opens Wednesday as the energy company approaches one year since General Electric completed its split into three separate companies. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha are mostly bullish, with 10 rating the stock a "buy," and two giving it a "hold" rating. Their price targets range from $361 to $446, with the average at about $392 sitting below Friday's record level after a strong week for the stock. Shares of GE Vernova gained nearly 3% Friday to close at an all-time high of $401.41, and have nearly tripled in value since their April debut. The company is expected to report revenue of $10.73 billion for the final quarter of 2024, up from $10.04 billion in the same time last year, when it was still part of General Electric. Net income is expected to come in at $634.87 million, after two of the company's first three quarters as a standalone company have resulted in net losses. The company said in previous quarters that its wind segment, the lone unprofitable arm of GE Vernova's three divisions, should be "approaching profitability" by the end of the fiscal year. The company said the shift will take time as it moves away from higher-cost offshore wind projects. Analysts have upgraded GE Vernova or lifted their price targets several times since it became its own company, including Bank of America analysts earlier this week. They have cited the growing demand for energy, especially in renewable forms, to power projects like data centers and artificial intelligence products as a positive catalyst for GE Vernova's sales going forward. The other former GE divisions, GE Aerospace (GE) and GE HealthCare (GEHC), are set to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 23 and Feb. 13, respectively.

WSB Now BANGKOK — (AP) — Asian shares advanced early Monday and bitcoin surged to a record high ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for a holiday. The price of bitcoin surged as high as $109,134 early Monday, up from $99,563, according to CoinDesk. Cryptocurrencies have gained substantially since Trump was elected, as investors wagered on his favor for such assets. European benchmarks gained in early trading, with Britain's FTSE 100 edging 0.1% higher to 8,515.80, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2% at 7,729.06. Germany's DAX was nearly unchanged at 20,902.00. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.8% to 19,925.81 after China’s central bank kept its key lending rates unchanged. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,244.38. A Hong Kong court extended a deadline for troubled property developer Country Garden to reach an agreement with its creditors until next month in the latest slow step toward recovery from a prolonged downturn in China's real estate sector. Sentiment also was helped by upbeat comments by U.S. and Chinese officials ahead of Trump's inauguration later Monday. Pledges by both sides to work to improve relations may have alleviated some concerns over trade tensions that have built up as businesses brace for a possible increase in tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.2% to 38,902.50. The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, trading at 156.17 yen, down from 156.31 yen. Expectations are building that Japan's central bank might raise its key interest rate in a monetary policy meeting later this week. Higher rates tend to boost the value of the yen versus the dollar. The euro rose to $1.0309 from $1.0281. In South Korea, the Kospi slipped 0.1% to 2,520.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5% to 8,347.40. Taiwan's Taiex picked up 0.5% and India's Sensex surged 0.7%. Bangkok's SET gained 0.1%. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 19 cents to $77.20 per barrel and Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 23 cents to $80.56 per barrel. On Friday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% and the Dow rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. SLB helped lead the market after the provider oilfield services delivered bigger profit and revenues for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. It jumped 6.1% after it also raised its dividend by 3.6% and said it’s returning $2.3 billion to its investors by buying back its own stock. All the Big Tech companies in what's come to be known as the " Magnificent Seven " rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Because they're so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks. Such shares have been under pressure recently because of criticism their prices may have shot too high after leading the market for so many years. Such worries grew after Treasury yields jumped in the bond market. Higher yields hurt prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive. But stocks broadly got a lift this week from an encouraging report on U.S. inflation, which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. More such cuts, which began in September, would ease the brakes off the economy and boost prices for investments, though they can also give inflation more fuel. Wall Street has been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports pushed traders to revamp their expectations about what the Fed will do with rates. Lower worries about inflation have sent Treasury yields down and stocks up, while worsening worries about inflation have triggered the opposite reaction. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.
