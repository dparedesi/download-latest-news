Rarely has a new All-Ireland League campaign been so generously sprinkled with stardust. Most notably, of course, Carlos Spencer has pitched up as the new head coach at Terenure College, but it doesn’t stop there. There are also strong rumours of Cian Healy and Keith Earls making prodigal returns for Clontarf in 1A and Thomond in 2C, and there’s been a wide influx from the Ireland Sevens squad, the schools and abroad to augment the presence of provincial academy players. Nenagh Ormond also provide some novelty value as the first club from Tipperary to play in the top-flight while there’s also been plenty of player movement during the summer. Jordan Coghlan has made a return home to Clontarf, with his relocation to Malahide outbidding even the pull of his Terenure friends and King Carlos. The champions have also acquired a host of talent from UCD, including Ireland under-20s lock Alan Spicer, while backrower Richie Whelan has returned from his stint in La Rochelle and Angus Lloyd is back again. After last season’s trophy-laden season, and despite losing John Vinson to Australia, ‘Tarf look strong once more, although no team has retained the title since Shannon in 2006. Cork Constitution were the latest to come up just short, and last season’s beaten finalists have lost two of the star turns in their 2024 success (outhalf James Taylor and winger Matthew Bowen) to Australia, as well as John Forde and Daniel Hurley to Blackrock. But they have again recruited well from UCC, while another of that title-winning side, Rob Hedderman, and Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, have both rejoined. And Con are, well, Con. St Mary’s, who host Clontarf on opening day, were the first newly promoted side to make the playoffs and have retained all their key men, while UCD/Leinster academy prop Andrew Sparrow and former Ireland under-20 prop Oisín Michel look like good signings. After their Bateman Cup win, Lansdowne were the form team in the second half of the season. Along with Coghlan, their acquisition of Bobby Sheehan looks like one of the signings of the summer. Ditto former Connacht centre Tom Daly, the ex-UCD captain James Tarrant and Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy from Naas. Inspired by Marks, newly installed as captain, they beat Clontarf in a full-on Leinster Senior Cup semi-final and host Con for their opener. But last season’s top four will be hounded by the chasing pack. Ahead of welcoming Young Munster on opening day, Ballynahinch, fifth in three seasons running, had a low-key summer featuring a June trip to Boston. Aaron Sexton has returned from his NFL sortie, and they’ve signed the captain of Wallace High School’s historic Ulster Senior Cup breakthrough, John Rodgers, and his outhalf team-mate Quinn Armstrong, albeit influential centre George Pringle has moved to Australia. Despite losing Coghlan, Harrison Brewer is back in Terenure from Japan, as is Conall Boomer from the MSL. Despite earning a senior contract at Connacht, John Devine has joined, as has scrumhalf Griffin Culver from Manawatu, lock Sean Rigney, and 22-year-old Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski. Terenure beat St Mary’s and Lansdowne to win the Leinster Senior Cup, thanks to a hat-trick by under-20 winger Dan Martin and an eye-catching debut by Ben Blaney (last season’s captain in the school’s run to the final) in Spencer’s first official game at the helm. They start with three away games as their refurbished clubhouse won’t be open for business until the second half of the season and there’s a new gym coming on board. They ought not to be dull. Limerick club rugby is struggling, witness Garryowen and Shannon propping up on the top two flights, yet Young Munster defy this trend and could well be dark horses again despite losing Rigney and Leszczynski. As usual, they’ve cast their net far and wide. The 28-year-old former PBC, UCC and Cork Con scrumhalf John Poland has returned from the New England Free Jacks, Connacht duo Harry West and Orin Burke have joined, and so too has a 20-year-old Kiwi lock AJ Henson, on the recommendation of Lifeimi Mafi. “I’m very happy with what we’ve brought in,” says head coach Ger Slattery. “Hopefully we can gel them into a team to give us a successful season.” UCD head coach Emmet McMahon is sufficiently buoyed by the talent coming through and some shrewd acquisitions to target a quicker start than last season, avoiding the playoffs on the last day by a point. Old Belvedere, runaway 1B champions, have recruited heavily and in acquiring Hugh Hogan as head coach, the Irish women’s loss is surely their gain. After their dramatic playoff final win over UCC, Nenagh Ormond will bring boundless enthusiasm and several returning sons to supplement a home-grown core. Former Cresent Comprehensive and Munsters’ outhalf Oscar Davey returns from the USA to offset Ben Pope’s return to New Zealand. The 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran will occasionally don his boots, and they’ve enjoyed a Donnacha Ryan-arranged preseason in La Rochelle. Nenagh’s first game in the top-flight at home to Old Belvedere on Saturday (kick-off 4pm) will be streamed live on IrishRugby+.

Outs: Ben Pope (returned home to NZ). Of the relegated duo, City of Armagh looked better equipped to bounce back than Garryowen on the basis of last season’s points tallies. Yet Garryowen were well beaten by Clogher Valley and Instonians in the Ulster Senior Cup. But City of Armagh have had a poor Ulster Senior Cup campaign, losing heavily to Instonians and Clogher Valley. By contrast, although relegation was compounded by departures, Garryowen’s Munster academy players have been swelled by the signing of Crescent and Irish schools fullback Fionn Rowsome. And after finishing last season strongly, Mike Sherry’s sky blues have had promising Munster Senior Cup wins away to Old Crescent and UCC. Having missed out in last season’s playoff semi-finals to Nenagh, Blackrock are strongly expected to mount another big promotion push under James Blaney. They’ve signed a couple of Leinster academy players in the powerful young Roscrea centre Jack Deegan and hooker Lee Fitzpatrick from Newbridge, as well as Connacht hooker Eoin de Buitléar. In Tomás O’Leary’s second season, UCC look less equipped after their late drive to last season’s promotion final having lost a few players to Con. Local rivals Highfield only just avoided a relegation playoff last season but good Munster Senior Cup wins over Cashel and Young Munster augur well. Morgan Lennon’s Old Wesley have been consistent contenders in recent seasons, although Reuben Pimm has moved to the Netherlands and they’ve lost Dan Campbell and Cronan Gleeson to UCD and Nenagh respectively. As was the case last season, Queens look like they’ll be heavily dependent on the availability of their sizeable Ulster academy contingent. As ever, Johne Murphy’s Naas will play some of the division’s best rugby, with Charlie Sheridan in midfield, although Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy has moved to Lansdowne. With James Cronin at the helm as player-coach, Highfield’s powerful maul and Ireland Sevens outside back Nicky Greene have shown up well in preseason and they could also be in the mix. Trinity, after Matty Lynch’s last-day dramatics against Cashel averted a second successive relegation, should be a year older and wiser after keeping their team largely intact, starting their campaign at home to Blackrock. Centre John O’Sullivan has joined from the ‘Rock’s Schools Cup-winning side, as has his team-mate Russian lock Artur Smykovskiy. Ambitious Instonians, with the Whitten brothers still in situ and Craig Gilroy a summer signing, will be seeking a fifth promotion in succession. Following a second successive relegation, nine-time champions Shannon have installed former captain Lee Nicholas as Director of Rugby to plot a return to the second tier, and the preseason form (featuring a 27-22 win away to Bruff) has been encouraging. Cashel will be itching to do likewise after their late mugging in the promotion final, although they look a little undercooked after a 32-12 loss in the Munster Cup at home to Highfield. The youthful, entertaining Corinthians set the early 2A pace last season but Connacht demands and midwinter triggered a fall-off and they missed out on the playoffs on points difference. Jim Harding has departed as head coach, and ex-Ireland under-20 centre John Devine has moved to Terenure. However, former Connacht and Terenure centre Colm de Buitléar has moved in the opposite direction, and under new coach Ambrose Conboy they’ve beaten Buccaneers (38-11), Galwegians (27-19) and Sligo (24-19) to win the club’s first Connacht Senior League crown since 1995. There’s a trio of Ulster sides in Banbridge, Ballymena and Dungannon (promoted via the playoffs). With Rob Lyttle in their ranks, Banbridge look the pick of the three. MU Barnhall beat Greystones, as they did in the playoff semi-finals last season, in the Leinster League final a fortnight ago to lay down a marker as both look like contenders again. Old Crescent will need to improve significantly as they were well off the pace last season, while newly promoted Wanderers, who had a poor Leinster League campaign, have enrolled Sean Skehan on a consultancy basis. On foot of the recent AIL survey, the main recommendation the IRFU has adopted is something they had wanted to do – regionalise Divisions 2B and 2C, in large part to save on travel expenses. This will not be popular with some clubs, who will understandably feel that the regionalisation of the lower two divisions will detract from the appeal of their campaigns and make them glorified junior clubs. This being the 11th season of the current format of five divisions of 10 teams apiece, it is also yet another redrawing of the AIL map. Depending on the make-up of the regions, it could also remove much of the jeopardy this season. After their relegations last season, Buccaneers (who have lost 33 of their last 36 AIL matches to suffer successive demotions) and Navan (who lost to Trinity and Greystones in the Leinster League) have had difficult starts to their campaign. So opportunity could knock again for Clogher Valley, who were denied a potential third successive promotion by their 23-22 semi-final playoff defeat to Dungannon but had good wins over Ballymena and City of Armagh in the Ulster Senior Cup before losing to Instonians. Nine of Galwegians’ 10 defeats last season were by a single score before they lost away to Navan in a playoff semi-final. With Stephen Mannion pulling the strings, Niyi Adeolokun has joined Brendan Guilfoyle’s ticket as attack coach. After encouraging Connacht League wins over Sligo and Buccs, they should be in the mix for promotion again and so avoid the IRFU’s expanded trapdoor. Ditto for Rainey Old Boys and UL Bohemians, while Malone’s early season form looks on a par with the former. After last season’s narrow escape, Sligo have hired former Connacht coach Grant Ross as their new Director of Rugby and have brought in four new forwards in Evan Ballantyne, Pat Lynch, Max O’Hehir, and Argentinian number eight Facundo Dellamea. Under New Zelander Ross their Connacht League form improved, beating Buccs and pushing Corinthians. Skerries, who survived via the playoffs, lost to MU Barnhall and Naas in the Leinster Senior league, but did have an encouraging win over Wanderers, whereas newly promoted Enniscorthy cancelled two of their Leinster League games and lost to Trinity in the other. After a seven-year absence and many near misses Bective Rangers are back in the senior ranks after a thrilling 39-34 win over Thomond in the playoff final augmented their first All-Ireland Junior Cup success. They’ve added to that momentum by beating Malahide, relegated to 2C from 2B, and Monkstown to claim the Leinster Shield and, as others have done upon emerging from the junior ranks, could even push for promotion. Thomond should also hold their own after their victory away to Omagh Academicals in the promotion/relegation playoff final ended their six-year absence from the AIL. They join fellow Limerick club Bruff, who gave Shannon a run for their money in the Munster Cup. Dolphin (who were a 1A club 11 years ago) were well beaten by Con in the Cup. They and Ballyclare lost in the playoffs last season, and the latter look likelier contenders than Belfast Harlequins, a 1A club 12 seasons ago, or Clonmel, beaten 60-0 by Young Munster in the Munster Cup.

Title: How a Billion Dollar Buy of Tesla Stock Set up a Trillion Dollar Vote
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/how-a-billion-dollar-buy-of-tesla-stock-set-up-a-trillion-dollar-vote/

On September 15, 2025, Elon Musk filed a disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating that he had acquired approximately 2.57 million shares of Tesla Inc. in open-market transactions on September 12, at a cost of nearly $1 billion. This represented his first meaningful open-market purchase of Tesla stock since 2020. Most of his holdings had come through exercising options granted under earlier compensation arrangements. According to the filing, the purchase prices averaged just under $390 per share. The market responded swiftly: Tesla’s stock surged to an intraday high of $425.70 before closing at $410.04. For a company with a market capitalization of roughly $1.4 trillion, such a reaction, amounting to more than a 5 percent move, was remarkable. Almost all major news outlets interpreted Musk’s purchase as a signal of renewed confidence in Tesla and, perhaps more importantly, of his willingness to devote more time and energy to the company amid his many competing ventures. That confidence proved contagious: Investors embraced the signal by imputing to the company nearly $70 billion of additional market value on the basis of the CEO’s $1 billion outlay. What the purchase does for Musk himself, however, runs deeper. First, there was a fortuitous coincidence: September 15, 2025, the date Musk’s purchase was disclosed, was also the record date for Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for November 6. In practice, this means that all share acquisitions settling on or before September 15 are eligible to vote at the meeting. Purchases made on Friday, September 12, settled just in time under the new T+1 rule (excluding weekends) to be included on the record date. CEOs are generally predisposed to selling shares in their own companies, as they receive a ton through compensation, both to meet personal consumption needs and to diversify their portfolios. However, our prior research paper[1]discovered that when a contested voting event, such as a proxy contest, is on the horizon, CEOs slow their selling and may even accumulate additional shares to strengthen their voting and control power. In separate research, one of us documented record-date vote-buying by investors when controversial issues are on the meeting agenda.[2] This pattern maps exactly onto Musk’s behavior: He had been a consistent seller of Tesla stock in recent years, including liquidating tens of billions of dollars’ worth to finance ventures such as the acquisition of Twitter (now X), but in 2025 he made no sales, and, on the deadline for the record date, he executed a sizable purchase. So, what will be voted upon in the November shareholder meeting? At the center of the agenda is the proposed $1 trillion notional-amount compensation package for Elon Musk, a performance-based award of historic scale in corporate America. While the headline figure of $1 trillion has captured public attention, the actual realizable value will depend on whether an array of milestones are met, including market capitalization in multi-trillion-dollar increments, breakthroughs in full self-driving and robotics, and sustained profitability targets. What is clear, however, is that the vote will determine whether Musk receives the proposed package upon delivering the company’s most ambitious aspirations. At present, Musk beneficially owns 19.7 percent of shares outstanding (the percentage of votable shares could be a bit lower[3]) and other insiders such as his brother and board members hold an additional 0.2 percent.[4] For context, the largest outside shareholders are the usual “Big Three,” Vanguard (6.9 percent), BlackRock (5.7 percent), and State Street (3.5 percent). Put differently, Musk’s voting bloc by itself outweighs that of any single institution by a wide margin and is large enough to neutralize the combined opposition of two, or even three top outside investors. Tesla’s latest proposal may give some shareholders a sense of déjà vu. In 2018, they were asked to endorse what was then the most generous CEO pay deal in corporate history, an option grant nominally valued at $56 billion. That vote was advisory, a “say-on-pay” resolution that received about 73 percent support from unaffiliated shareholders (i.e., excluding Musk), allowing the board to justify implementing the plan. Yet in 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court voided the arrangement, faulting the board’s process and independence. Perhaps to avoid a repeat, the 2025 proposal has been structured differently on three key ways. First, the vote is binding (not “advisory”), i.e., approval by a majority of the shares present, and voting at the annual shareholder meeting is required for Musk to receive the award, ensuring that it has more legal force. Second, unlike in 2018 when Musk’s own shares were excluded, this time his stake will be included in the tally. This is perhaps because the current proposal has not been designated as a related-party transaction but instead as a board-approved employment agreement amendment, such that under the Nasdaq rule, Texas law, and Tesla’s bylaws all outstanding shares are entitled to vote. Musk needs about 40 percent of the outside votes to be cast in his favor. Given that 73 percent of more or less the same external shareholder base supported the 2018 package, achieving this threshold should not pose a significant challenge. Third, by disclosing the additional ownership, Musk was accidentally or effectively conducting an experiment that calibrates how the market would respond to a deeper personal commitment when concerns have been raised about the distractions faced by an unusually versatile CEO. Against that backdrop, a relatively small increase in his exposure, about 0.6 percent of shares outstanding, or $1 billion, triggered a nearly $70 billion rise in Tesla’s market capitalization. The leverage was striking: For every dollar Musk added, investors received seventy more. The implication is that if a marginal outlay can move the firm’s value so dramatically, then a fully focused CEO, dedicating his time and mind to Tesla’s most ambitious goals, could plausibly generate more in shareholder wealth over the next decade in $1 trillion units. Pope Leo has already expressed deep misgivings about the scale and symbolism of the package,[5] but much to his dismay, institutional investors may well vote it through.

Title: Ripple Powers New Offramp For BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Fund

Ripple has added another institutional rail to its stablecoin strategy: through an integration with Securitize, holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized US Treasuries can now redeem fund shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD) around the clock—initially on Ethereum, with support for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the pipeline. In a press release dated September 23, Ripple and Securitize said a new smart-contract flow “would allow holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL to exchange their shares … for Ripple USD (RLUSD),” describing the mechanism as “an additional stablecoin off ramp for BUIDL and VBILL tokenized short term treasury funds.” The companies emphasized continuous availability—“24/7”—and framed the upgrade as programmable liquidity for compliant, on-chain investment products. Securitize also confirmed it is integrating with the XRP Ledger “to expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem.” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, positioned the move as a bridge between tokenized funds and transactional money: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” On X, McDonald distilled the news for market participants: “RLUSD is now a key stablecoin offramp for BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized fund holders. The integration is starting with ETH, though Securitize is planning to integrate with the XRP Ledger.” Ripple President Monica Long linked the Securitize integration to a broader RLUSD tokenization push announced the prior week with DBS and Franklin Templeton, where RLUSD serves as a “liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases.” “This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds,” she noted. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underscored the 24/7 redemption promise and the XRPL roadmap: “Very excited to share that BlackRock’s BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.” The companies framed the design as explicitly regulatory-first. Ripple said RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, with “1:1 USD backing by high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve management and asset segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights.” Ripple added that since launch in late 2024, RLUSD has integrated into DeFi and cross-border payment flows and surpassed $700 million in market capitalization. For tokenized funds, the off-ramp matters because it stitches together yield-bearing on-chain treasuries with settlement-grade stablecoin liquidity. BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL are tokenized short-term US Treasury strategies issued through Securitize on public blockchains; the new workflow lets qualified holders convert fund shares into RLUSD without banking hours friction, potentially improving collateral mobility for trading, lending, repo and treasury operations. The development also follows Ripple’s tie-up with DBS and Franklin Templeton, which is listing Franklin’s sgBENJI token on the DBS Digital Exchange alongside RLUSD to enable swapping between the tokenized fund and the stablecoin, and to explore using tokenized fund units as repo collateral—an example of how banks envisage tokenization rails meeting institutional liquidity needs. While the initial redemption path is live on Ethereum via Securitize, both firms signaled that XRPL integration is next, aligning with Ripple’s push to make RLUSD natively useful across multiple venues. If executed, XRPL support would extend the same institutional redemption mechanics to a different settlement environment—one that Ripple and parts of the treasury-tokenization market already touch via custody, payments, and prior Franklin Templeton XRPL issuance plans. Notably, BlackRock will be represented at Ripple Swell 2025 in New York on November 4–5 at Convene Hudson Yards. Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, is slated to speak in a session titled “The Impact of Tokenized Financial Assets on Capital Markets,” alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s.

The labour cost is still lower in India | Photo Credit: DEEPAK KR Much before US President Trump’s decision to increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000 from the existing fees ranging between $2,500 and $5,000, the red line was drawn when he hosted 33 Silicon Valley leaders (including five Indian-origin top executives such as Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella) at the White House. Although the meeting was about artificial intelligence and US investment, behind the scenes the talk was about a paradigm shift — how AI programming tools can now generate thousands of lines of code quickly, reducing demand for junior software engineers. This may explain why major US tech companies such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft, have been consistently laying off workers in recent times, particularly before the hike in H-1B visa fees. In fact, the US-based IT firms are more dependent on H-1B visas than Indian IT firms. Even in India, the top six IT firms added just 3,847 employees in Q1FY26, a 72 per cent drop from Q4FY25. TCS made national headlines for laying off 12,200 employees, which is about 2 per cent of its global workforce. Although we are worried about the fate of around 400,000 Indian IT workers whose H-1B visas may not be renewed in the event of this fee hike, such a thing was bound to happen. Region-wise, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas, accounting for 71 per cent of 3,99,395 in H-1B visas 2024, while China was a distant second at 11.7 per cent. Market participants had anticipated a sharp fall in stock prices of Indian IT companies heavily reliant on the US market when the stock market opened on Monday after the announcement. By the end of trading day, these stocks declined an average of 3.4 per cent. AI, automation, and cloud computing are changing the face of tech hiring, something which came too quickly, especially when there is a growing pool of computer science graduates specialising in coding that has been growing over the years. Graduating with a degree in computer science became a fad, with top tech executives, billionaires, and even US presidents promoting the field and encouraging students to learn coding. Throughout the past decade, a degree in computer science was yielding results, with fresh graduates in the US starting off with salaries exceeding $100,000 plus substantial bonuses and stock grants. Same trends were noticed in India and elsewhere across the globe. Like in the US, in India, there is a craze for admitting students to computer science programmes, with recent estimates suggesting India is producing in excess of one million engineering graduates every year. This has led to excess supply, particularly in the age of AI driven technological change. This is akin to the cobweb model in economics, where farmers grow a particular crop in response to higher price signals in the present period, only to realise there is excess supply in the next period. We are witnessing a similar event now but spread across a longer time horizon to adjust for the technological change. Entry-level hiring by Indian IT firms has dropped sharply from pre-Covid levels. The same can perhaps be said of employment generation, generally speaking, in the organised sector. India (like elsewhere in the world) is slowly transforming into a gig economy where the labour market is increasingly characterised by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work. Private studies have shown that over half of Indian companies have more than 20 per cent of their workforce as contingent workers. The Periodic Labour Force Surveys corroborate this trend. In fact, most of the hiring in manufacturing, whether by the government or by private corporate enterprises, is now being increasingly outsourced to private contract suppliers. That things change so rapidly, requiring adjustments from both industry and the education system, is not new. Even the advent of computers and technology that marked the rise in productivity during the last century required adjustments. Alongside computers, electricity, combustible engines and refrigeration aided economic growth through a more productive labour force and necessary training. This has led to the creation of thousands of jobs in manufacturing. In the age of big data analytics, machine and deep learning, there is an apprehension that machines are increasingly taking over jobs performed by humans. But that is not entirely true. Newer types of jobs are opening up and it is in this transition phase that things will be little difficult. According to an August 2025 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates, ranging between 6.1 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively. That is more than double the unemployment rate among recent biology and art history graduates, which is just around 3 per cent. In an ironic twist, job applicants leverage AI tools such as Simplify to mass-customise their resumes and applications, only to have companies use similar AI technology to automatically screen them out. The silver lining for India is that irrespective of Trump’s hike in visa fees, it will lead to more offshoring. The labour cost is still lower in India, which has a high number of STEM graduates. It will only bolster investment in Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India accounts for 55 per cent of the world’s GCC centres (according to IBEF), employing around 1.9 million people. For the existing talented Indian IT workers other opportunities are opening up, for instance, China now announced issuance of K visa after Trump announced a hike in visa fees. Middle-East countries and the UK are other places waiting to welcome these skilled workers from India.

Title: Candidates begin canvassing in Presidential Election

Independent presidential candidate Catherine Connolly has described America as an "imperial power" contributing to current volatility. "We have a very volatile situation in the world. We have imperial powers. America is one of those imperial powers. As a neutral country we have a duty [to] use our neutrality to call out the abuse of power, no matter where that is, whether by Russia or America," she said. Ms Connolly was asked about her comments at UCD last night drawing parallels between the current increase in military spending in Germany and its rearmament during the 1930s. She said that more and more there was a "profitable military industrial complex" that was heading in one direction rather than putting the money into peace. "After the Second World War, we said no more wars. And more and more, we have a more profitable military industrial complex that's heading in one direction. It's very hard to keep figures in my head. We're not putting that money into peace," she said. Last night, Ms Connolly contended that there are "parallels" between the rearmament policies of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the recent decision by Chancellor Friedrich Merz to substantially increase military spending. She was outlining her concerns to UCD's Politics and International Relations Society, and remarked: "They're absolutely championing the cause of the military-industrial complex in Germany, as a booster for the economy ... Seems to me, there are some parallels with the ’30s." When the German Chancellor successfully campaigned in the Bundestag to boost defence spending earlier this year, he justified the move by citing the threat posed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, saying: "We have for at least a decade felt a false sense of security." Around the same time, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said governments should be able to draw on €150bn in loans over the next five years, adding this would allow them to "massively step up their support to Ukraine". In her conversation with UCD students, Ms Connolly said she didn't want to "depress" them by referencing the "spend all over Europe on the military industrial complex", but added: "There is hope. And we have voices. And we can use them."

Ms Connolly, who is backed by the left-leaning parties in the Oireachtas, attended a meeting of the Dáil Public Accounts Committee this morning in her capacity as a TD for Galway West. Afterwards, and as a presidential candidate, she campaigned in the capital and is due to attend a rally in Harold's Cross this evening. Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys started her campaign today in Laois, with a lunchtime canvass in Portlaoise. Speaking in Portlaoise before travelling on to Limerick, Ms Humphreys said she's enjoying meeting people on the campaign trail and wants to be a president who focuses on the themes of "opportunity, unity and community". After canvassing in Limerick City, Ms Humphreys attended a Fine Gael rally in Patrickswell. Earlier, Ms Humphreys said housing supply is "the biggest challenge" facing the country and "very tough", but stopped short of agreeing with outgoing President Michael D Higgins that it has become a "disaster". Speaking this afternoon, Ms Humphreys said her focus is on securing 'number one' votes in the Presidential Election. Asked if she will be seeking Fianna Fáil 'number 2s', she said, "Regarding where people want to give their numbers twos, it’s a bit early at this stage. "My focus is going to be on looking for their support for me because if you don’t get enough votes, you don’t get elected," she said. Gavin had 'positive experience' in Defence Forces Fianna Fáil candidate Jim Gavin was in the capital this morning, with a canvass in Dalkey, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire. Speaking in Dalkey, Mr Gavin said the Women of Honour, a group formed by current and former female members of the Defence Forces, have done a great service to the State by stepping forward and that lessons needed to be learned. When asked if he had witnessed any bullying or sexism in the Defense Forces, Jim Gavin said he did not. "I had a really positive experience in Defence Forces but I understand not everybody had that, and that's why I'm very proud of what they did, those women, they stepped forward. I'm fully behind them, and I'm really keen to see what comes out," he said. When asked if he would, as president, greet US President Donald Trump if he visited Ireland, Mr Gavin said: "Any elected head of state that comes, comes to the country that the president has to meet, I will meet them." Mr Gavin said he is looking forward to taking part in the upcoming presidential debates. "I'm really looking forward to it and enthused by it. I'll do my preparation as best I can and to represent my candidacy and what I'm going to offer and bring to the presidency of Ireland," he added. Yesterday, barrister Maria Steen failed to secure enough support to join the race, securing 18 Oireachtas nominations when 20 was required. After her campaign ended yesterday morning, Ms Steen told the media that "rarely has the political consensus seemed more oppressive or detached from the public's wishes". However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected suggestions that the failure of Ms Steen to secure a nomination was "anti-democratic". Voting takes place on 24 October. With just three candidates, it is the smallest field in a Presidential Election since 1990. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Could Intel's Next Big Investment Come From Apple?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/could-intel-s-next-big-investment-come-from-apple-nvidia-trump-11816712
Time Published: 2025-09-24T22:51:16Z
Full Content:
Intel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%. Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do. With Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company. Still, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by "hold" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder. A deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers. "If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block," Bernstein analysts wrote last week. "If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there." New partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing.

Title: Longevity At Work: Why The Retirement Crisis Is A Unique Opportunity

ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. For decades, 65 has been treated as the finish line of work. But that age marker signaling retirement was never designed for today's world. It originated in 19th-century Europe, when reaching the age of 70 was still a statistical rarity. Today, with people regularly living into their 70s, 80s, and 90s and thriving, the framework is becoming obsolete. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink underscored this in his 2024 annual letter to investors. He noted that if people are living longer and healthier lives, then the model of retirement must evolve in tandem with them. The old assumptions no longer fit. By mid-century, one in six people globally will be over the age of 65, according to Fink's letter. In the U.S., there's a high probability that the Social Security Administration program will be unable to pay full benefits by 2034. These demographic and financial pressures are often described as the core of a looming retirement crisis. But there's another issue that isn't readily discussed. Too many organizations still assume careers wind down at 65 and treat older employees as liabilities. In reality, longevity is extending careers by decades. Some countries are already adapting. The Netherlands, for instance, links its retirement age directly to life expectancy, acknowledging the current demographic reality and resetting expectations for both citizens and employers. The conversation typically comes to a halt at the point of system strain. However, another story is hiding in plain sight: older employees are staying in the workforce at record levels. A 2025 Newsweek survey found that 51% of adults nearing retirement age now expect to work indefinitely. That same report showed the share of Americans 65 and older in the workforce grew by 33% from 2015 to 2024, compared to less than 9% growth in the labor force overall. Among small businesses, the share of employees aged 65 and above has increased by 50% since 2019, according to Gusto's 2025 labor report. The drivers are financial—rising healthcare costs, disappearing pensions, shifting Social Security rules—but also deeply human. Many older workers mention purpose, mental stimulation, and social connection as reasons for staying employed. For organizations, this is a potential opportunity and can serve as a dividend for retention: experience, judgment, and cultural stability that compound over time. Workers who’ve weathered multiple business cycles bring perspectives and mentorship that younger teams can't replicate. With flexible arrangements, phased retirement, or hybrid roles, CEOs can leverage decades of knowledge and loyalty that might otherwise be lost. For much of the 20th century, the deal was straightforward: work 40 years, retire at 65, and rely on a pension. That contract has dissolved as careers now stretch six or seven decades, pensions are rare, and Social Security is under strain. Retirement is shifting from a hard stop to a glide path. Instead of abrupt exits, older employees are transitioning into flexible roles, project-based work, and different career arcs. For many, it is less about a paycheck than about relevance, stimulation, and purpose. Forward-thinking companies will design new principles and compacts that include: Longevity has already created a new class of late-career professionals. Companies that design and optimize for them will hold a distinct competitive advantage. Longevity is no longer a future variable; it is a present reality. The real question for leaders is whether they will treat it as a cost to contain or as capital to deploy. That requires a shift in both mindset and structure. CEOs and organizational leaders must: The retirement age of 65 may have been fitting for a different century, but today it is a relic of the past. What was once described as an impending retirement crisis can, in the hands of forward-thinking leaders, become a source of resilience and a unique competitive advantage.

Title: An ETF For Crypto Treasury Firms Could Launch Soon—Here’s What To Know

ByKirk Ogunrinde, Former Contributor. GSR Markets, a crypto trading firm, has filed to launch a new ETF that bundles a number of crypto treasury companies’ shares into one single fund, allowing investors to easily gain exposure to firms buying up crypto tokens. GSR's Digital Asset Treasury Companies ETF would bundle companies that buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets—known as digital asset treasury firms—into one single fund that investors can buy. The ETF would also allow private investments in public equity (PIPE) deals—deals that allow investors to purchase equity directly from a publicly traded company—according to the filing. While other ETFs offer crypto exposure, GSR's fund is the first to offer exposure to the select group of crypto treasury companies. The ETF is expected to launch pending regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchanges Commission, but a date has not been given. GSR trades crypto tokens and provides venture funding for over 300 companies, according to its website. What Is A Digital Asset Treasury Company? Digital Asset Treasury Companies are firms raising capital through various measures to fund and hold significant portions of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy , a software enterprise company turned crypto treasury, was the first to adopt this tactic in 2020 with bitcoin and crypto companies like Upexi Inc, Sharplink Gaming, and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have followed. Crypto ETFs, similar to stock ETFs, allow investors to invest in cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These funds are overseen by professional fund managers and are under regulatory guidance. Investments can be managed through traditional brokerage accounts, without investors having to manage digital wallets or secure storages. Firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale manage crypto ETFs across tokens like bitcoin, Ether, and Solana. Tangent The crypto treasury trend gathered steam this year, as companies rushed to take advantage of a crypto spike amid bitcoin's all-time high in August. According to crypto tracker bitcointreasuries.net, the 194 bitcoin treasury companies hold more than $117 billion worth of the token.

Title: Nvidia Stock Up 1,124%. Other Winners And Whether To Buy $NVDA

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's $100B investment in OpenAI, linked to $350B in chip sales, raises circular financing concerns, drawing parallels to Cisco's risky dot-com era vendor lending.OpenAI's $1 trillion data center ambition heavily relies on Nvidia's investment, securing vital chip supplies for AI growth, though potentially at lower margins for Nvidia.The AI hardware sector, led by Nvidia, is experiencing a significant boom, with its segment of the Generative AI Stock Index surging 403%, driving overall market growth. Nvidia shares are up 29% this year and 1,124% since the beginning of 2023. The company’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI raised questions about whether that rally would continue, according to the New York Times. The most fundamental question is this: Is Nvidia using its own money – investments in Open AI, CoreWeave and others – to fuel growing demand for the company’s graphics processing units? This brings back memories of the dot-com boom when Cisco Systems provided financing to startups to fuel growth in demand for the company’s networking equipment. Through its Cisco Capital arm, the company lent billions to money-losing telecom firms to buy Cisco’s products. In the late 1990s, Cisco regularly reported 40% to 60% revenue growth and by 2000, 10% of the company’s $20 billion in revenue was attributable to such financing and leasing deals. When the dot-bubble burst in 2001, Cisco set aside $900 million in reserves for bad loans to those customers, reported the Los Angeles Times, and tightened its lending standards. To be sure, if Nvidia's investments do not pay off, the GPU designer will not need to write off bad loans as Cisco did – but it could mark down the value of those investments on its balance sheet. In the meantime, all of these investments make Nvidia and Open AI the lead companies in a V-shaped forward migration of AI technology providers. Other segments of the industry – including chip makers and their suppliers, data center technology and energy providers, database companies, and many others, noted my book Brain Rush – are benefiting from this ongoing boom as evidenced by the 157% rise in my Generative AI Stock Index (compared to a 116% rise in the Nasdaq). OpenAI is planning to build $1 trillion worth of data centers – $300 billion worth will be supplied with help from Oracle and another $100 billion from the Nvidia deal, reported the Wall Street Journal. "Everything starts with compute," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale." If OpenAI – which last fall said it expected to lose $44 billion through 2029, noted the Journal – can find the cash to finance these data centers, the industry will keep expanding. That may keep shares of Nvidia, Oracle, and many other participants in the AI ecosystem rising. If not, look out below. An Nvidia spokesperson declined my request to comment. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in $10 billion chunks. For every gigawatt of Nvidia-supported data centers OpenAI builds, Nvidia will invest $10 billion. For every $10 billion Nvidia invests, OpenAI will spend $35 billion on Nvidia chips, according to New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu whose work was featured in The Economist. OpenAI will pay for the chips through a blend of 71% in cash and 29% stock, noted NewStreet Research. One worrisome aspect of this deal is its lower margins for Nvidia. “That arrangement reduces Nvidia’s typical margins for cutting-edge chips,” wrote the Journal, while the chip designer will benefit from ensuring steady GPU demand. This deal also lowers OpenAI’s cost of capital due to Nvidia’s relatively sterling credit rating. Prior to this deal, OpenAI bought thousands of Nvidia’s chips through cloud service providers and neo-clouds – which buy chips and develop data center clusters – “renting them out at a premium,” the Journal reported. These data center builders borrow money to finance their operations. Data center deals associated with money-losing companies such as OpenAI were financed at interest rates as high as 15%; whereas the interest rates for deals backed by Microsoft ranged from 6% to 9%, the Journal wrote. Nvidia – which generated $72 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters – seems to have ample interest free funds for financing its Open AI deal. It remains to be seen whether the chip designer will fund all $100 billion of its OpenAI commitment. Mark Twain reportedly said history does not repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes. Will Nvidia’s huge bets on money-losing companies such as OpenAI rhyme with Cisco’s aggressive lending to unprofitable telecom service providers? It is too early to tell. However, Cisco’s lending during the dot-com boom “highlights the lengths to which one of the darlings of Wall Street would go to keep reporting revenue increases,” noted the Los Angeles Times. For Cisco, a key question was whether the company booked revenue for these financing deals too soon. In some of the company’s deals, such as those of American Metrocomm and Digital Broadband Communications, Cisco recorded sales only when the customers began repaying the loans, the Los Angeles Times wrote. In other cases, such as Rhythms NetConnections – an Englewood, Colo. based Internet access provider owned by a then-major Cisco shareholder Bill Stensrud – “Cisco booked sales at the outset -- even before a penny had been collected and even when the customers were teetering toward a bankruptcy filing,” reported the Los Angeles Times. Rhythms was unprofitable – reporting a loss of $36 million on $1 million in 1998 sales. But Cisco shipped $20 million of its equipment to Rhythms prior to the company’s April 1999 IPO. By August 2001, Rhythms had filed for bankruptcy leaving $30 million in unpaid debt to Cisco, according to the Los Angeles Times. By 2003, Cisco was chastened. “Cisco recognized that there were risks involved” in its earlier strategy, the company said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, “but the decision to proceed was made for sound business reasons and based on analysis of the facts that existed at the time.” An economist who studied the telecom industry and reviewed documents about Cisco’s lending practices reached a sobering conclusion. By making loans to so many distressed companies, “these guys were operating under a fallacy,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jerry Hausman told the Los Angeles Times. For a company to increase sales this way, he added, it’s like “you’re pumping yourself up on steroids,” Hausman added. The takeaway? Investors should keep a close watch on how much of Nvidia’s revenue is coming from customers in which the chip designer has invested. Moreover, it’s worth investigating the accounting policies for recognizing revenue from such deals and quantifying their value on Nvidia’s balance sheet. When Nvidia announced its investment in OpenAI, shares in other technology providers rose as well. Other stocks – notably Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, memory supplier SK Hynix, STMicro, Infineon and BE Semiconductor – gained ground, reported CNBC. My Generative AI Stock Index, about which I wrote in a June 2014 Forbes post, aims to capture the stock market performance of companies in the following industry segments: Overall, the GAISI has risen 157% between the beginning of January 2023 – the month ChatGPT reached 100 million subscribers – and September 24, 2025. Here is the average return for the four segments of the industry value network during that period: The top performing industry segment was generative AI hardware – of which Nvidia (+1,124%) and liquid cooling provider Vertiv (1,012%) – were the leading stocks. The worst performing sector was AI consulting – of which Gartner dropped most – down 23%. Analysts gave mixed opinions about Nvidia’s investment. The good news is the investment assures things get built; the bad news is 'circularity’ – which I interpret to mean Nvidia is buying its own products through a third-party. “On the one hand this helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Reuters. “On the other hand the 'circular’ concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further,” Rasgon added. Several analysts see the deal adding between $400 billion and $500 billion to Nvidia’s revenue. For example, “We estimate this deal ultimately translates into ~$400B of NVDA revenue over a multi-year period,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Monday, reported Barron’s. Another analyst shares Rasgon’s concerns about circularity and sees both Nvidia and OpenAI being better off. “So Nvidia has the demand for the chips, but are also investing, hoping that OpenAI itself becomes a good investment,” Creative Strategies CEO Ben Bajarin told the Times. Circularity has led to problems in prior tech booms. If OpenAI can keep convincing investors to provide more capital, Nvidia has a chance of reporting better-than-expected results. Otherwise, AI could become a bubble that bursts.

Title: Estée Lauder heir William Lauder quietly sold a prized NYC home for $37.5M — as he seeks to downsize

William Lauder, the ousted executive director and longtime chairman of Estée Lauder Companies — and a scion of the cosmetics empire — has sold his prized co-op at 998 Fifth Ave. for $37.5 million in an off-market deal. News of that transaction was first reported by the Real Deal. And it comes as the billionaire is looking to shed some homes from his portfolio. The buyer for the 998 Fifth residence is Evan Cheng, the co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, a blockchain infrastructure firm. Cheng, a former senior engineering executive at Meta, paid a significant premium over the $23.5 million Lauder spent on the unit in 2017 — netting the cosmetics heir a $14 million gain over eight years. The apartment, Unit 6W, is located in one of the most storied buildings along Fifth Avenue, a limestone landmark completed in 1912. The unit has four bedrooms and five bathrooms, with a gracious eat-in kitchen and oversize windows framing views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The sale marks the latest move in a broader property reshuffling for Lauder, who has been quietly trimming his property portfolio. He is currently marketing a 12th-floor apartment at 778 Park Ave. — once owned by former Revlon chief Ronald Perelman — for $25 million, a slight drop from the $27 million asking price he initially set last year, StreetEasy shows. He’s reportedly looking to sell it in a downsizing effort. Lauder acquired that unit for $24 million in 2023 and also owns another apartment in the same building, purchased in 2008 for $27.5 million. That home was once listed for $45 million, but failed to sell. Outside of Manhattan, Lauder is eyeing a record-breaking sale in Palm Beach. There, he had reportedly found a buyer in recent months for a $178 million pair of oceanfront parcels, but it’s not immediately clear if the deal fell through. If those properties ultimately sell for anywhere near asking, the deal would set a new residential sales benchmark for Florida. Lauder purchased the adjacent estate from the estate of conservative broadcaster Rush Limbaugh in 2023 for $155 million. Advertisement

Solana continues to prove the power of utility-driven projects over hyped ones. Its tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have soared to a record $671 million, setting a new all-time high and cementing Solana’s status as a hot blockchain. 🚨BREAKING: The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on @Solana has surged to $671M, a new all-time high. The surge came after over $150M of inflows into @BlackRock’s $BUIDL fund on Solana. pic.twitter.com/51pkm0tFrA — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) September 24, 2025 The milestone comes after $150 million in new capital poured into Solana via BlackRock’s BUILD fund. That confirms robust interest from institutional players. Such breakthroughs indicate a key shift, with Solana’s low fees and speed now attracting massive on-chain transfers. Indeed, BlackRock’s fund has ignited Solana’s RWA marketplace, as anticipated. BREAKING: BLACKROCK BACKED BY SECURITIZE HAVE INTEGRATED WITH SOLANA TO EXPAND TOKENIZED REAL WORLD ASSETS ( RWAs ). TRILLIONS ARE COMING INTO MARKET pic.twitter.com/uuZCcOnzWN — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) January 30, 2025 BUILD focuses on tokenizing traditional assets and money market funds. Thus, the massive injection into the SOL network signals is a significant vote of confidence. Besides boosting numbers, institutional inflows bring attention, credibility, and liquidity. These factors are crucial for any project’s growth. It is not only the project’s dollar value that’s soaring. Solana has exhibited a healthy ecosystem lately. Its RWA transfer volume increased by roughly 23% to $12.19 billion in the past month. Moreover, RWA holders jumped 17% to 77,982 wallets. That confirms new participants joining the network as institutional players lead the charge. Also, stablecoin transfer volume surged 26.23% in the last 30 days to $318.99 billion. The $12.37 billion stablecoin market cap and 11.43 million holders affirm Solana’s position as a go-to platform for on-chain settlement. Growing grassroots activity amid increasing institutional inflows indicates a healthy ecosystem flourishing on all fronts. Solana sees activity from day-to-day users and wealthy financial institutions. The RWA breakthrough comes as institutional investors continue to transform Solana’s long-term narrative. Galaxy Digital-linked Forward Industries holds SOL worth approximately $1.63 billion. Also, Pantera Capital has invested over $1 billion, signaling trust in Solana’s long-term potential. Moreover, Helius Capital added over 760K SOL tokens to its treasury, with plans to scale using a significant $335 million cash reserve. 🚨 Breaking: Helius Medical has stacked 760,190 $SOL and is gearing up to scale with a massive $335M cash reserve! Extremely Bullish For Solana!! pic.twitter.com/SQ9To3Oc42 — Crypto Elias (@ItsCryptoElias) September 22, 2025 Solana’s native token performed well in the past few sessions, rallying to $250 monthly highs. However, the upside steam weakened, and bears seem to control the short-term trajectory. SOL is trading at $214 after losing 8% and 2% the past week and day. The altcoin’s underperformance is likely anticipated as prices cool down after the latest rally from around $150 in early August. Also, the downward trajectory coincides with broader market dips. Analysts remain bullish on Solana, citing bullish fundamental and technical factors. The digital asset is holding the key support zone at $210. Validating it could catalyze short-term gains toward the $250 target.

Title: ‘Shot in the foot’: Indians are outraged over Trump’s H-1B move

Families rushed off flights from New York to New Delhi. Ticket prices for India–US routes soared overnight. WhatsApp calls buzzed with panic as Indian professionals in America tried to make sense of what had just happened. When US President Donald Trump announced a staggering $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, the shock rippled instantly through Indian communities on both sides of the ocean. For many, the American dream they had spent years building seemed to collapse in a single press release. One of them was Suman (name changed), 39, a healthcare worker in New York. After three years of living apart from her husband and sending money home to support her elderly parents and sister, she sat in her apartment staring at her phone in disbelief. “I am on a H-1B visa, and I have been so stressed since then that my life seems like it will go upside down,” Suman told RT over a WhatsApp call from her apartment in New York. “I’ve been working here for the last eight years, and I have taken loans and mortgages. Everything felt like it was coming crashing down on me.” For families across India, Trump’s sudden move upended their daily life. Muhammad Anas, 62, from the southern state of Telangana, said his family was devastated. “My daughter is working in the US and teaches social science at a college. She is on a H-1B visa. We all felt very distressed, and she was crying on the call. She has two children, and her husband is pursuing a PhD there. The whole family feels the pain of what is going on,” he told RT. “The Indian government should take up the case with the US so that our children have some kind of certainty.” Back in India, the announcement also rattled young professionals who had been preparing for years to build their lives in America. Kazim Ahmad, 27, a graduate of a premier engineering college in West Bengal, said he was crushed. “I spent two years getting certified and interviewing for US companies. I feel very disheartened and devastated. It seems my American dream is dying now,” Ahmad said. “I come from a very poor family, and my state is also very poor. Going to the US could have stepped my family out of poverty and helped me progress, but now, I do not think aspirants have an option to move to the US.” Another hopeful, Vipul Kumar, echoed the frustration. “I spent my money and time on exams. I planned my life around the opportunities in the US. I feel very lost now.” Even those already working in America were forced to reconsider their plans. Inder Jeet, 35, from Haryana and an employee of a global tech giant, said his company warned him not to travel. “I was planning to go home next week and meet my family after two years, but now my company has informed us not to travel. I am heartbroken, but I am also thinking about what comes next for us,” he added. “The families on H-1B are enduring a nightmare. Some have just bought a home on a mortgage, and some have high loans to pay; everyone has a story.” For Suman in New York, the fear goes beyond bills and mortgages. “We do not know what tougher measures this administration is coming out with for migrants who are really working hard in this country to be part of it. To be part of the American dream,” she said, admitting she now questions whether it is wise to build a future in the US “There are a lot of questions in my mind.” The announcement left companies and employees scrambling. Within hours, several American tech giants warned their Indian staff not to leave the country and for those already abroad to return as quickly as possible. Rumors spread across airports, WhatsApp groups, and workplaces, fueling fears that even existing visa holders might be locked out. It wasn’t until the next day that the administration sought to calm the chaos. The White House clarified that the new $100,000 fee would apply only to fresh H-1B applications, not renewals or extensions. Current visa holders, officials said, would not be affected. At the same time, the Trump administration doubled down on its broader policy shift. A new proposal outlined changes to the H-1B lottery that would prioritize higher salaries and “top talent,” with the stated goal of protecting American workers from “unfair wage competition from foreign workers.” New Delhi was quick to sound the alarm. India’s Ministry of External Affairs described the sudden shift as more than an economic measure – calling it a potential “humanitarian crisis.” “This measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused to families. Government hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities,” said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the ministry. He added that the mobility of skilled talent had contributed enormously to technology development, innovation, and economic growth in both countries. “Policymakers will therefore assess recent steps considering mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the countries.” For Indians in the US, many say it is not about the job alone, but about the years of hard work they have put into building their lives in a country where they are now staring at an uncertain future. Earlier, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Indian goods exported to the US, plus additional duties as a penalty for trading with Russia – making some exports completely unviable. Industry experts in India were more blunt. Mohandas Pai, former chief financial officer of Infosys, warned that Trump had “shot himself in the foot.” “These companies are among the most valuable assets in the US and the foundation of its global dominance. They are heavily reliant on high-quality H-1B talent from around the world,” Pai said, adding that the sharp fee hike would freeze fresh demand and push companies to shift jobs offshore. Pai estimated that the impact on India itself will be minimal, since the fee hike applies only to new applications. He pointed out that there is already a substantial stock of H-1B employees in the US, and most Indian IT firms now maintain large local (American) teams in their US development centers. “Over the past five years, they have undertaken risk mitigation measures,” he explained. He added that the visa restrictions would likely accelerate the growth of Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India. “The multinational corporations respond to the scarcity of work visas by offshoring more operations.” India’s Sherpa for its G20 presidency in 2023, Amitabh Kant, slammed Trump’s move. He stressed that the $100,000 H-1B fee will choke US innovation and turbocharge India’s. “India’s finest doctors, engineers, scientists, innovators have an opportunity to contribute to India’s growth and progress towards Viksit Bharat,” he tweeted. Donald Trump’s 100,000 H-1B fee will choke U.S. innovation, and turbocharge India’s. By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon . India’s finest Doctors, engineers,… Officials in India’s IT hubs also suggested the move could prove a long-term advantage for the country. Jayesh Ranjan, special chief secretary in Telangana, called it “a game changer.” “More skilled professionals may now choose to stay or return to India, which will fuel domestic innovation, startups and economic growth, and help transform India into a global technology hub. This will mainly affect American companies and some Indian youths who prefer going to the US. With this, many will be motivated to stay back, and this reverse brain drain will strengthen economic opportunities, competitive wages and broader reforms,” the official told The New Indian Express. For thousands of Indian families in the US, the new visa fee feels like a nightmare – mortgages, student loans, and years of sacrifice suddenly overshadowed by political uncertainty. As one H-1B worker put it: “Everyone has a story – a house just bought, a loan to repay, parents to support. Now everything is in doubt.” Yet industry observers in India say the broader impact could be more complex. Ajay Bagga, a financial markets commentator, noted that the policy might reduce India’s long-running brain drain, forcing both government and industry to find ways to absorb and productively employ highly skilled talent at home. “Brain drain will reduce, and India will have to find other avenues or productively use these people. This will be an objective for the government too,” he told ANI news agency. Others predict neighboring countries will benefit first. Canada and the UK, both eager for high-skilled migrants, could see a surge in applications as US doors narrow. Still, many in India believe the long-term opportunity lies at home – with more engineers, doctors, and innovators choosing to stay, fueling startups and strengthening the country’s own technology ecosystem. In the short term, though, the uncertainty remains crushing. For families like Suman’s, it isn’t just about fees or policy. It’s about watching years of effort and sacrifice suddenly hang in the balance – and wondering whether the American dream is still worth chasing.

Major U.S. equities indexes were little changed in recent trading, after snapping a record-setting streak yesterday. Lithium Americas (LAC) shares soared following a report the Trump administration may take an up to 10% stake in lithium project developer. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the biggest U.S. lithium producer, also gained. Alibaba (BABA) shares surged after the Chinese tech giant said it is planning to spend even more on AI in the next three years than the $53 billion it projected previously. Shares of Diamondback Energy (FANG), APA (APA), and other energy providers continued to climb along with the price of oil, which rose after U.S. crude inventories declined. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the miner said it expects lower sales of copper and gold in the current quarter. Shares of Adobe (ADBE) also slid after a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, which raised concerns about the software maker’s ability to monetize AI. Motorola Solutions (MRI) shares fell as Piper Sandler warned the telecom equipment maker’s stock may be overvalued. Gold futures fell, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: The Shiller P/E ratio, a trusted stock-market gauge, just hit its highest level since the dot-com bubble
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-24T14:43:25Z
Full Content:
A trusted market gauge has surged to its highest levels since the dot-com bubble, signaling stocks are the most expensive in 25 years. The Shiller P/E ratio, also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, compares the current value of a stock index like the S&P 500 to its average, inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years. The S&P's Shiller P/E ratio crossed 40 on Monday for the first time since 2000, when it reached a record 44. That spike preceded a 49% crash for the benchmark stock index between March 2000 and October 2002 as the internet boom collapsed. "The US equity market looks expensive relative to its history, pretty much any way you slice it," Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider by email. He added that the Shiller P/E and several other valuation measures are "all in the top 10% of their historic ranges." Mould said that "valuation does not guarantee an imminent accident," but investors might want to take precautions, in part because US stock returns have been "modest to disappointing" when they've traded at "similar Shiller P/E multiples to those in evidence now." He added, "The tricky bit is 10 years is a long time and you don't know when trouble is going to strike!" The Shiller P/E ratio was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, who predicted the dot-com bubble would burst in "Irrational Exuberance," published just as the market peaked in March 2000. He correctly warned the housing boom could collapse in the book's second edition, published in 2005. Investors use the traditional P/E ratio to value a company's stock based on its earnings multiple, or how many times higher its price is than its earnings per share, or EPS, in a year. They calculate it by dividing a stock price by an annual EPS figure, either historical or projected. Similarly, the Shiller P/E ratio takes a stock index's point value and divides it by the combined EPS of its constituent companies over the last 10 years, adjusted for inflation and divided by 10 to get a real, average figure. So if the S&P 500 is at 6,700 points, and its average, inflation-adjusted EPS over the last 10 years is $167, dividing one by the other yields a multiple of 40. The ratio can smooth out the effects of business cycles on profits by factoring in a decade's worth of earnings, providing a longer-term perspective on market valuation than the conventional P/E ratio. The Shiller P/E ratio doesn't indicate an imminent crash, as markets can remain overvalued or undervalued for years. It also doesn't account for interest rates, index composition, economic shifts, and corporate profitability, which can vary between time periods and influence valuations. The S&P 500 has doubled in five years to trade at record highs, led by AI stocks such as Nvidia, which has soared almost 14-fold to become the world's most valuable public company with a $4.3 trillion market capitalization. Several commentators have flagged that stocks are pricey. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday speech that "equity prices are fairly highly valued." Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, told Business Insider in August that the huge market values and vast shareholder bases of AI companies like Microsoft and Meta meant "more investors will suffer than suffered in the dot-com crash, and their suffering will be more painful." But "Shark Tank" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed the comparison between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble in separate interviews with Business Insider. O'Leary said in August that the AI boom isn't like the dot-com bubble because "you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis." Gerber said that valuations are justified because AI companies promise tremendous growth and their profitability is "just insane." Copyright © 2025 Insider Inc and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

September 24, 2025 10:09 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Native Markets claimed that over $15 million worth of the stablecoin was pre-minted in the 24 hours before it went live on Wednesday. Earlier this month, Hyperliquid opened proposals to take over the USDH ticker on the network. As a result, a stream of crypto companies put their hats in the ring, including the likes of Paxos, Agora, and Ethena—the last of those with backing from BlackRock. However, it was Native Markets, a company formed just “months” prior to proposals opening, that won the bid. “The next stage of Hyperliquid's ascendance will be driven by native stablecoins,” Native Markets co-founder Max Fiege wrote on X. “We're honored to be leading the charge with USDH and look forward to showing up for the ecosystem every single day.” The next stage of Hyperliquid's ascendance will be driven by native stablecoins. We're honored to be leading the charge with USDH and look forward to showing up for the ecosystem every single day. https://t.co/wnaOpwLs4r — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 24, 2025 The primary condition for proposals was for the USDH ticker to be a “Hyperliquid-first” and “Hyperliquid-aligned” stablecoin. Native Markets is doing this by donating half of USDH revenues to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, a protocol-driven buy-back fund. The issuer’s proposal claimed the stablecoin is backed by a mixture of cash and “U.S. treasury equivalents” managed by Bridge—a platform acquired by payments giant Stripe in 2024—and will be compliant with regulations in the U.S. and Europe. It is worth noting that the USDH ticker will not receive any “special privileges,” the Hyperliquid Foundation said. That didn’t stop crypto heavyweights from fighting over the ticker, presumably seeing it as a premium ticker for a U.S. dollar stablecoin on a rapidly growing network. Despite the big names bidding for the stablecoin, three days before the vote commenced, predictors on Myriad thought it was 96% likely that Native Markets would win. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.) Some Hyperliquid community members and builders called foul play, suggesting that Native Markets were given a head start and that validators were only considering the new firm’s proposal. Native Markets did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. USDH’s debut comes at an interesting time for Hyperliquid, as it faces its first significant rival since launch. BNB Chain-based decentralized exchange Aster has seen its token skyrocket since launching last week, per CoinGecko, with the platform flipping Hyperliquid in revenue in the process. That said, according to DefiLlama, Hyperliquid remains ahead of Aster in weekly trading volume and revenue. Both projects are decentralized exchanges specializing in perpetual futures trading. Hyperliquid has dominated the field, although it appears that Aster is here to rival one of crypto’s biggest projects. Aster has surged 19% over the past 24 hours to a price of $2.31 and a nearly $3.8 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko, making it the 49th largest coin by market cap. Hyperliquid has fallen more than 6% on the day to $44.81, by comparison, although it remains well ahead with a $12.3 billion market cap and the 19th largest cryptocurrency. Even so, it's down almost 19% on the week, making it one of the biggest losers in the top 100 coins by market cap. Myriad users have turned bearish on HYPE's prospects in recent days, however, with 73% of predictors expecting the token to fall to a price of $39 sooner than it can rise to a new high of $69. The odds flipped on Sunday amid Aster's rise.

Full Content:
The evolution of urban-fringe-rural structures profoundly impacts ecosystem services (ESs). However, the way in which trade-offs and synergies in ESs respond to changes in regional spatial structures has rarely been discussed. This knowledge gap hinders the development of spatially explicit strategies to mitigate ecological degradation while accommodating urban growth, ultimately perpetuating unsustainable landscape management practices characterized by reactive rather than preventive interventions. Such critical disconnect between structural dynamics and ES feedbacks has emerged as a major bottleneck to operationalizing landscape sustainability in metropolitan regions. This study selected Suzhou—a typical megacity in China—as an example to conduct an empirical study. The urban, urban fringe, and rural areas were firstly identified in 2010 and 2022 using Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on multi-source geographical data. Then, seven typical ESs were assessed using multiple models, and their interactions were examined through correlation analysis, coupling coordination degree model, and a self-organizing feature mapping network approach. At last, this study highlighted the complex responses of ESs relationships to dramatically changing spatial structure of urban-fringe-rural areas and proposed landscape management strategies. The findings include the following: (1) from 2010 to 2022, the spatial structure of urban-fringe-rural areas in Suzhou changed considerably, with 69.04% rural areas transformed into fringe areas, and 50.83% fringe areas developed into urban areas; (2) based on transition process, the region was further divided into urban maintenance, urban expansion, fringe maintenance, fringe expansion, and rural retention areas. Most of the mean value of ESs showed a gradient increasing differences along urban-fringe-rural, while the greatest decrease occurs in fringe expansion and urban expansion areas; and (3) interactions for changes in ES pairs also more closely linked in these two regions, with synergies dominating. The coupled coordination index among multiple ESs declines significantly in these areas, degrading from key coordination to key or mild trade-offs bundles. The results show ES interactions exhibit significant spatial variability under the evolution of metropolitan spatial structure, thus innovatively proposing integration of ESs synergies into urban-fringe-rural development framework to support overall landscape sustainability.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The traditional urban-rural dichotomy has long defined the territorial structure of cities and rural areas. However, with urbanization, increasing interactions between urban and rural elements have blurred these boundaries, especially in metropolitan areas [1–3]. Scholars proposed the existence of a vast, transitional, dynamically evolving zone between urban-rural areas as the urban-rural fringe [4,5]. Scott emphasized that the fringe area is a distinct geographic unit, characterized by its evolving nature [6]. Thus, the urban-fringe-rural geographic classification model is gradually replacing the original dichotomy to capture complexities of regional spatial organization. However, most studies have focused on urban expansion, exploring its identification, evolutionary process, and impacts [7–10]. Less attention has been paid to broader spatial structure of urban-fringe-rural areas and their associated impacts. Properly defining the spatial extent of these areas is crucial for understanding territorial structures, assessing the socio-economic and spatial consequences of their evolution, optimizing land use, and enhancing ecological protection. Urban areas are characterized by high population densities and intensive industrial activities, with land use dominated by built environments [11,12]. Rural areas, in contrast, feature lower population densities and limited industrial development, with land predominantly devoted to agriculture and natural ecosystems [13]. The fringe areas, situated between urban and rural areas, exhibit a transitional mix of geographic elements [14,15]. This regional geospatial structure reflects the distribution of social and economic factors [16], with shifts symbolizing changes in human activities that impact ecosystem services (ESs). ESs are the benefits humans directly or indirectly derive from ecosystems, such as regulating, provisioning, and cultural services [17,18]. The interactions among ESs can involve trade-offs, where the increase of one service reduces another, or synergies, where multiple ESs are enhanced simultaneously [19,20]. This variability makes landscape less capable of providing stable, long-term ESs, which in turn affects human well-being [21,22]. Efforts to enhance ES synergies between urban and rural areas are gain attention, involving ES assessments, landscape fragmentation, ecological network security, and multifunctional ecological agriculture [23–26]. However, many studies separately focus on urban or rural areas, often overlooking the unique dynamics of the fringe zone. Megacities, characterized by large populations and expansive urbanization, present a complex urban-fringe-rural spatial structure [27]. The concentration of population and industry in these cities leads to significant, often irreversible land-use changes. These shifts pose potential risks to ESs and their trade-offs, further intensifying urban ecological unsustainability [28–30]. the evolution of urban-fringe-rural spatial structures helps clarify the complexity of urban-rural systems and their dynamic patterns. By examining how these changes affect ESs, it is possible to more accurately assess and predict ES supply, changes, and interactions, leading to more effective strategies for optimizing and protecting these services and promoting sustainable urban-rural development. Hence this study makes efforts to address the following questions: What are the spatiotemporal patterns of urban-fringe-rural structural evolution in megacities? How do ESs trade-offs and synergies respond to these changes? How can ES synergies be integrated into sustainability planning for urban–fringe–rural landscapes? This study takes Suzhou—a typical megacity in China—as an example. Over the past decade, Suzhou has experienced rapid urban growth, especially at the urban fringe, resulting in significant ecological challenges. As such, it provides an ideal setting for investigating the evolution of urban-rural spatial structures and the performance of ESs trade-offs. In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) model was constructed to identify urban, fringe, and rural areas in Suzhou, subdividing the territory into five zones based on transformation trends from 2010 to 2022. Then 7 key ESs were assessed by integrating models like InVEST and Maxent. Subsequently, correlation analysis, coupled synergies, and clustering technique were applied to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of ESs relationships. The results help reveal the evolutionary patterns of ESs across these geographic zones. Finally, refined landscape management strategies are proposed. By mapping and prioritizing areas of intense ES trade-offs, integrating ES synergies into the classification and planning of urban-fringe-rural landscapes, planners can employ targeted interventions, such as green infrastructure, multifunctional agriculture, or ecological corridors. This can provide a clear pathway to sustain overall landscape functionality, balance competing land-use demands, and strengthen regional resilience. The flowchart of this study is shown in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g001 Within the longstanding traditional framework of the urban-rural dichotomy, previous studies often distinguish urban and rural areas based on multi-source data like land-use data, nightlight intensity, point of interest (POI), and common research topics include urban sprawl, land-use transition, ESs change, and environmental degradation [31–34]. With a deeper understanding of urban fringe areas, the urban-fringe-rural triadic structure has gained increasing attention from scholars, gradually replacing the urban-rural binary structure as the regional classification framework for theoretical and empirical research in fields such as geography, urban planning, land resource management, and ecological planning [35,36]. Mutation detection and comprehensive evaluation methods are two main models to identify urban, fringe, and rural areas. The former uses clear spatial data like POI and nighttime lights to find spatial differentiation [37], while the latter relies on socio-economic indicators and spatial clustering [38,39]. Through informative, these methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, with limited scalability in spatiotemporal analysis. Recent advances data processing and artificial intelligence have led to the application of machine learning methods. For example, Liu employed deep neural networks (DNNs) to identify urban-fringe-rural regions based on POI data [40], but this approach’s reliance on single-dimensional data limits its ability to capture the complex characteristics of urban-fringe-rural transitions. On the other hand, Jiao utilized graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with multi-source data to analyze spatial changes over time [41], but it primarily focused on scale variations, lacking a deeper exploration of the dynamic evolution of spatial features. To fill this gap, this study employs a DNN model to identify the spatial boundaries of urban, fringe, and rural areas. The DNN model is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers, supporting to learn complex representations of multi-source geographic data. It is characterized by its ability to handle large, high-dimensional datasets and model non-linear relationships, making it ideal for classifying spatial units into urban, fringe, and rural types. After identifying the spatial extent of these areas at two temporal nodes for a typical megacity, this study further explores the spatiotemporal evolution of the urban-fringe-rural regional structure. Additionally, it conducts a thorough analysis of the ESs relationship in the context of these spatial changes. ESs synergy has become a key objective in ecological planning and sustainable development, as it optimizes ecological functions and supports ecosystem health [42]. ESs are typically classified into provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services [43]. Their assessment often involves process-based models (e.g., InVEST, SWAT) or statistical models (e.g., regression, time series analysis), using ecological principles, historical data, and GIS tools [44,45]. To understand the complex interactions between ESs, correlation analysis and spatial models are commonly employed, revealing trade-offs or synergies [46]. Factors influencing ES trade-offs include land-use, urbanization, climate change, ecosystem configuration, and socio-economic drivers such as population density and agricultural intensity [47–49]. Strategies for optimizing ES synergies generally focus on integrated land management, multifunctional land uses, ecosystem connectivity, and sustainable agricultural practices [50,51]. While research on ES trade-offs has primarily examined urban expansion, studies show that urban growth tends to reduce provisioning services (e.g., agricultural output, resource depletion) but can enhance cultural (e.g., recreation) and regulating services (e.g., urban climate regulation) [52]. Some studies also explore ES dynamics in urban fringe areas, highlighting competition among ESs due to land-use changes [53]. Others have balanced ES from a comprehensive rural-urban distribution perspective, indicating that rural areas prioritize ecological services like water retention and biodiversity, while urban areas emphasize cultural and regulating services [26,54]. However, there has been limited analysis of how ES trade-offs and synergies evolve across the broader spatial structure of urban, fringe, and rural areas. This gap limits the ability to manage ESs in a dynamic, holistic, and territorially comprehensive framework. The evolution of urban-fringe-rural spatial structures, especially in metropolitan regions, is widespread and continuous [55]. Once rural areas transition to urban or fringe zones, reversing this transformation is uncommon, as developed land seldom reverts to its non-built state. This irreversibility underscores the long-term consequences of land use changes. The urban-fringe-rural structure can be divided into five zones, including urban maintenance zones, urban expansion zones, fringe maintenance zones, fringe expansion zones, and rural retention zones. Each zone exhibits unique ES characteristics, encompassing both trade-offs and synergies. Understanding how ES relationships respond to dynamic changes in these zones is crucial for advancing sustainable development and optimizing ES management across urban and rural landscapes, helping to balance ecological integrity with the development needs of megacities. Suzhou (30° 47’–32° 02’ N, 119° 55’–121° 20’ E) is a prefectural city in Jiangsu Province, Southeast China, with a GDP of 2,395.83 billion yuan (333.28 USD) by the end of 2022, ranking among the top 20 regions in China. The city has a population of 12.911 million and an urbanization rate of 74.42%, making it a typical megacity selected for this case study. The rapid expansion of construction land (Fig 2) has significantly altered the urban-rural landscape. This growth, particularly evident in fringe areas where farmland and wetlands are being converted, creates competing demands on ESs—for instance, boosting housing and transportation capacity while reducing flood regulation and biodiversity. These intertwined trade-offs highlight the need to precisely map how different zones (urban core, expanding fringe, and rural hinterlands) contribute to ESs relationships. By understanding which areas see the sharpest conflicts between development and ecological functions, planners can target conservation efforts where they matter most, such as protecting critical wetlands in fast-urbanizing corridors or promoting green infrastructure in newly developed suburbs.

All data were reprojected to a consistent coordinate system, and the spatial resolution was harmonized to 30 m. ES trade-offs were assessed at the village administrative unit level based on grid-scale measurements. Following were main types of data and descriptions (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t001 The first challenge in classifying urban, fringe, and rural areas lies in establishing objective criteria for training the DNN model and validating the results. Given the absence of standardized frameworks, prior studies have relied on manual identification. In this study, five experts in urban planning and geography were engaged to identification, and following steps were taken: 1) Experts were divided into two groups—four in the identification group and one in the validation group; 2) For 2010 and 2022, 1000 random geographic points were generated for each year. Each point was input into Google Maps with a 1000-meter radius, and satellite images within this radius were extracted; 3) Two members of the identification group reviewed and labeled the images as rural (0), fringe (1), or urban (2), resulting in 2,000 labeled images; 4) If both members agreed on the label, it was forwarded to the validation group for final assessment. If the validation expert agreed, the label was confirmed; 5) In cases of discrepancies, the remaining identification group members re-evaluated the images, and the validation process repeated. If disagreement persisted, the point was discarded and a new one generated (Table 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t002 Building upon this foundation, two DNN classification models were constructed for 2010 and 2022, each trained with 1000 labeled sample points (80% training, 20% test). The model architecture included an input layer, two hidden layers (128 and 64 neurons), and an output layer with Softmax activation for a three-class classification. The model used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. Accuracy, calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted samples to total samples, was the primary evaluation metric. Key geographic features were selected to represent the distinctive characteristics of urban, fringe, and rural areas. These included population density, GDP density, construction land density, POI density, nighttime light brightness, and landscape fragmentation (Table 3). All datasets were processed at a 1 km spatial grid scale. Dropout layers (rate = 0.5) were added after each hidden layer to prevent overfitting. The model captured and learned complex nonlinear relationships between the input features using deep neural networks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t003 Guided by the principles of differences in ESs in urban and rural landscapes, the importance of ESs to urban and rural residents, and data availability, seven ESs, including one provisioning service (food production), four regulating services (carbon storage, soil conservation, water purification, and water yield), one supporting service (habitat quality), and one cultural service (landscape aesthetics), were selected in this study during 2010 and 2022. All ESs were quantified at a grid spatial resolution of 30 meters. The detailed assessment methodology is presented in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t004 Correlation analysis, coupling coordination degree model, and self-organizing mapping network methods were employed to investigate interactions between multiple ESs across temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal dimensions. To eliminate scale differences between ESs, Min–Max normalization was applied to standardize the data: where is the normalized ES value, is the observed value, and and are the minimum and maximum observed values. Spearman’s nonparametric correlation analysis was then used to identify trade-off or synergy relationships among ES changes from 2010 to 2022. Positive correlations indicate synergy, while negative correlations indicate trade-offs. The “corrplot” package in R4.3.1 was used to visualize correlations among ESs in 2010 and 2022. The correlation coefficient was calculated as: where is the correlation coefficient (value range [−1,1]), and and are ES data values. To explore the interactions among multiple ESs, we employed the coupled coordination degree model (CCDM) at the village scale to assess coordination changes in Suzhou from 2010 to 2022. Spatial trend analysis identified shifts in incoordination, shedding light on the evolutions of ES relationships over time and space. Coupling measures the interaction strength between systems, quantified by the coupling degree (CD) [65]. The coupling coordinated degree (CCD) reflects the level of integrated system development. For k systems, the coupling degree model (CDM) is given as: where represents the average value of each ES in a village, and C ranges from 0 (low interaction) to 1 (high interaction). When C = 1, the systems are fully integrated, and When C = 0, they are independent [66]. To assess coordination, the CCDM formula is: where T reflects the overall impact of the ESs, and a, b, c, …, h are coefficients that reflect the relative importance of each service (values: 0.12 for most services, and 0.16 for habitat quality, based on expert recommendations). D ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better coordination. Coordination is categorized into six levels (Table 5), from extreme incoordination (F) to high-quality coordination (A) [67]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t005 To capture the response of key ESs and their trade-offs within the urban-fringe-rural territorial structure evolution, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering was applied. SOM is an unsupervised neural network that reduces dimensionality, visualizing high-dimensional data in a 2D grid while preserving topological relationships [68]. This method identifies patterns in ES interactions and their trade-offs, combining principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. SOM maintains the topology of input space through nearest-neighbor relationships and incorporates spatial data. Its ability to handle large, complex datasets while remaining interpretable makes it well-suited for exploring spatially distributed ESs across diverse structures. Additionally, SOM’s competitive learning algorithm detects hidden relationships without prior labeling, making it flexible for analyzing non-linear interactions among multiple ESs in dynamic environments [69]. In this study, the urban fringe of Suzhou was used as input, and the optimal number of clusters was determined by calculating the Davies–Bouldin index for 2–15 classes using the “kohenen” package in R4.3.1. This study maps the urban–fringe–rural spatial structure of Suzhou in 2010 and 2022, achieving DNN model accuracies of 0.9502 and 0.8850. The results (Fig 3) show that urban fringe areas are primarily located in the central and northern regions, with the south remaining predominantly rural. Both the central city and fringe areas exhibit polycentric dispersion and outward expansion. By 2022, the urban fringe covered 40.42% of the area, marking a 75.83% increase, while urban areas grew by only 2.13%. Conversely, rural areas decreased by 46.23%, covering 1,686 km2. Transfer analysis indicates that most land conversions occurred from rural to fringe areas (1,713 km2) and from fringe to urban areas (862 km2), representing 69.04% and 50.83% of the respective areas by 2022. This highlights that while the urban fringe is rapidly expanding, the rate of its transition to urban areas is slower, potentially leading to land resource inefficiency.

(Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g003 At the county level, there is notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Gusu District, Industrial Park, Huqiu District, and Xiangcheng District have the highest fringe-to-urban ratios (over 90%), indicating strong urbanization pressures. Changshu, Wujiang, and Taicang showed the fastest fringe growth (over 20% from 2010 to 2022), while Huqiu and Industrial Park experienced the most rapid urban growth (over 38%). Central Suzhou is characterized by urban expansion, while the northern and southern regions show more fringe expansion, reflecting differentiated urbanization patterns. Wujiang and Taicang’s substantial rural areas suggest lower urbanization, indicating potential for future development. Transformation scenarios were classified into five types, namely urban maintenance area (sustained urban from 2010 to 2022), urban expansion areas (transformed from fringe to urban), fringe maintenance area (sustained urban fringe), fringe expansion area (transformed from rural to urban fringe), and rural retention area (sustained as rural). Areas transitioning from urban or fringe to rural were excluded due to their minimal proportion, indicating that urbanization of rural areas is typically irreversible. fringe expansion areas (34.36%) make up the largest share, followed by rural retention (31.42%) and urban expansion (22.09%) (Table 6). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t006 From 2010 to 2022, most ESs showed higher values in the northern and southern regions of Suzhou, with lower values in the central area. This trend applied to services such as carbon storage, water purification, soil conservation, and habitat quality (Fig 4). Food production was highest in the northeastern and southwestern regions, linked to arable land, and lowest in mountainous and urban areas. Water yield and landscape aesthetics both peaked in the urban center. Overall, most services, except cultural services, declined, with food production declining by 37.68%, primarily in the urban core and northern fringe. Regulatory and supporting services significantly decreased near urban centers, while mountainous regions saw increases in water purification and soil conservation. Notably, water yield rose significantly, while habitat quality declined in the urban fringe. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g004 To understand the response of ESs to urban-fringe-rural spatial structures, changes across five regions were counted and compared (Fig 5). Most ESs—such as food production, carbon storage, soil conservation, nitrogen output, and habitat quality—were highest in rural retention areas, followed by fringe expansion areas, and lowest in urban maintenance areas, showing a decreasing gradient with urbanization. Conversely, urban maintenance areas exhibit the highest mean values for water yield and landscape aesthetics, with elevated phosphorus output in urban expansion areas. From 2010 to 2022, urban expansion, fringe expansion and urban fringe areas experienced substantial decreases in food production, water yield, and carbon storage, alongside the largest increases in landscape aesthetics. Soil conversation fluctuated in these regions. Notably, food production, carbon storage, nitrogen-phosphorus output, and habitat quality declined most in fringe expansion areas, with nitrogen output, food production and habitat quality dropped by 46.33%, 36.57% and 30.52%, respectively. Meanwhile, landscape aesthetics increased most in rural retention areas. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g005 The correlations between changes in ES pairs from 2010 to 2022 were calculated across five regions (Fig 6). Positive correlations indicate synergies, where two ESs increase or decrease together, while negative correlations reflect trade-offs, where one ES increases and the other decreases. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship. * FP—Food production; CS—Carbon storage; WY—Water yield; HQ—Habitat quality; SC—Soil conservation; TN—Nitrogen output; TP—Phosphorus output; LA—Landscape aesthetics. * FP—Food production; CS—Carbon storage; WY—Water yield; HQ—Habitat quality; SC—Soil conservation; TN—Nitrogen output; TP—Phosphorus output; LA—Landscape aesthetics. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g006 Overall, the correlation coefficients of most ES pairs grew stronger from 2010 to 2022, particularly as fringe or rural areas transitioned to urban or fringe areas. Trade-offs were most evident in urban and fringe expansion areas, particularly between food production and landscape aesthetics, habitat quality and landscape aesthetics, and carbon storage and water purification. Urban fringe areas, with their edge effects, showed stronger coupling of ESs under anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, rural reserves mainly experienced a loss in both food supply and habitat quality, reflecting the ecological degradation associated with urbanization. Additionally, trade-offs between carbon storage and nitrogen/phosphorus export, habitat quality, and food production were observed across all regions. To explore the interactions among multiple ESs in response to changes in urban-fringe-rural structures, a coupled coordination degree model was employed to Suzhou from 2010 to 2022. The results were categorized into six levels (Fig 7) and associated with the newly defined urban-fringe-rural territorial structure. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g007 From 2010 to 2022, the average coupling coordination values for ESs in Suzhou decreased from 0.5820 to 0.4481, showing a shift from primary synergy to mild incoordination. ES interactions exhibit dissonance in urban maintenance areas but evolved toward harmony along the urban–fringe–rural gradient, reaching synergy in rural retention areas. The transfer matrix revealed that urban maintenance areas experienced growing dissonance, while rural retention areas shifted from mild dissonance to synergy, particularly in villages of southern Wujiang District, where ES relationships balanced. Notably, the most significant changes occurred in urban and fringe expansion areas. In urban expansion areas, ES relationships deteriorated from synergy to high dissonance, while fringe expansion areas saw a shift from good synergy to primary synergy. These findings highlight the disparities in ES interactions during urban-fringe-rural transformation. Urban expansion areas faced greater risks of environmental incoordination, while fringe maintenance areas exhibited minimal change. Spatial analysis, supported by the standard deviation plot (Fig 7), shows that an expansion of incoordination areas and a reduction in synergistic ones by 2022. The directional trend of the plot spreads toward the northeast in line with fringe sprawl. This study utilized the self-organized mapping network clustering method to categorize ES bundles at the village scale, the smallest ecological unit in territorial spatial planning. Seven distinct ES bundles (Fig 8) were identified based on dominant services and their interactions: (1) Key trade-offs bundle. Found near urban areas, characterized by high water yield and landscape aesthetics but minimal food production and depleted other ESs. (2) Mild trade-offs bundle. Located in fringe areas, with high water yield and landscape aesthetics, but low food provisioning and reduced other ESs. (3) Key synergistic bundle. Primarily in rural areas, showcasing balanced ES provision and strong synergies. (4) CS-HQ-LA bundle. Found mainly in southwest rural Suzhou, with high carbon storage, and notable synergies among carbon storage, habitat quality, and landscape aesthetics. (5) HQ-LA bundle. Located in rural areas, dominated by landscape aesthetics and habitat quality, with strong soil conservation services. (6) Water purification bundle. Concentrated in areas with extensive water bodies (e.g., Wujiang District), offering effective water quality purification and low nitrogen/phosphorus outputs. (7) FP bundle. Primarily in northern Suzhou, dominated by high food production. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn).

In urban expansion area, key trade-offs and mild trade-offs increased from 39.3% and 33.8% in 2010 to 52.6% for key trade-offs by 2022. Similarly, fringe maintenance areas exhibited a shift toward key trade-offs, from 34.6% and 30.7% in 2010 to 45.1% in 2022. In the fringe expansion area, the key synergistic bundle and water purification bundles were prominent in 2010 (39.2% and 25.2%), but by 2022, the area shifted to dominance by the key synergistic bundle and mild trade-offs (40.5% and 20.8%), while the water purification bundle declined to 17.8%. The rural retention area, initially dominated by food production, water purification, and key synergistic bundles in 2010 (26.9%, 21.2%, and 20.4%), but by 2022, saw these proportions decrease by 2022. ES bundle transfers primarily occurred in the urban expansion, fringe expansion, and rural retention areas, with urban maintenance and fringe maintenance areas remained stable. In urban expansion areas, mild trade-offs shifted to key trade-offs due to increased built-up land, leading to degradation in soil and water conservation and habitat quality. The fringe expansion area exhibited varied ES bundle changes across regions. In central and northern regions, some villages near the urban fringe experienced an increase in water yield and a reduction in food production, transitioning from key synergistic bundles to mild trade-offs (19.4%). In Wujiang and Kunshan, certain villages saw a decline in water purification capacity, triggering cascading habitat quality trade-off effect that shifted them from water purification to mild trade-offs bundles (16.1%), while others transitioned to key synergistic bundles. In rural retention areas, notable changes occurred in the Taicang-Changshu border, where fragmented arable land diminished food production. Some villages near the fringe expansion area shifted from HQ-LA to mild trade-offs, indicating habitat quality degradation risk. Given the irreversible nature of urbanization, ES trade-off risks exhibit distinct stages, particularly in dynamically developing urban and fringe expansion areas. The delineation of urban-fringe-rural spatial structures through our DNN framework inherently balances methodological rigor and contextual adaptability. We employed city-wide random sampling (2,000 grids) and multi-stage expert validation (7.2% resampling rate) to minimize labeling bias while capturing Suzhou’s unique land use context. Specifically, we excluded large water bodies (>1 km2), which constitute 37.1% of the territory, and integrated fragmented forests (median size <0.5 km2) into the rural classification based on their inherently low-density characteristics (S1 Fig). When applying this framework to other contexts, researchers should be tailored to local land use profiles. For instance, implementing pre-classification masking for forest patches exceeding context-specific size thresholds (e.g., > 5 km2 in mountainous cities like Lishui or eco-cities like Xiamen) to avoid misclassifying densely forested areas as rural zones. Additionally, temporal validation across Jiangsu Province (2005–2022, accuracies: 0.84–0.95) through DNN and comparative analysis against traditional mutation detection methods (low accuracy: 0.66, S2 Fig) confirm the model’s capacity to decode gradient urbanization patterns characteristic of polycentric metropolises. These technical considerations underpin our core finding that Suzhou exhibits a multi-layered urban-fringe-rural structure, highlighting the continuous expansion of urban fringe areas in Suzhou. This pattern aligns with similar trends observed in other Chinese cities, such as Chengdu, Shanghai and Guangzhou [70–72]. Given the irreversible nature of rural-urban transitions and the inherent heterogeneity in these shifts of metropolitan cities, accurately capturing their dynamic evolution is crucial for sustainable landscape development. The study categorizes the urban-fringe-rural continuum into five distinct types, revealing a multi-core developmental texture and differentiated formation mechanisms. In Suzhou, for example, the historical Gusu District (Fig 9, City 1) anchors the city’s urbanization trajectory. The “one core, four cities” policy has reinforced centralized growth, leading to simultaneous internal growth and external expansion across sub-regions like Xiangcheng, Huqiu, the Industrial Park, and Wujiang District. This phenomenon creates a unique multi-layered spatial structure, marked by overlapping urban, fringe, and fringe maintenance zones. Meanwhile, sub-city regions (City 2) predominantly exhibit external expansion, driven by transportation corridors and regional integration policies, influenced by Shanghai’s economic effect. These areas reflect decentralized urbanization, with fringe expansion zones along major transportation routes. This trend resonates with suburbanization patterns (e.g., suburban enclaves or exurban growth in metropolitan peripheries in the U.S. and Europe [73–75]), but also highlights the regional specificity shaped by China’s policy-driven urbanization. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g009 The dynamic evolution of urban–fringe–rural spatial structures reflects a blend of internal densification and external expansion, offering a unique perspective for comparative studies on urban-fringe dynamics. This study also provides a practical foundation for exploring strategies for dynamic management, addressing social and ecological challenges, enhancing conservation, and promoting sustainable development in rapidly urbanizing regions. The dynamic evolution of urban–fringe–rural landscapes significantly influence ESs trade-offs and synergies, demonstrating the transitional and complex nature of these areas. Regulatory and supporting services like carbon storage, water purification, and habitat quality have markedly changed in fringe and expansion areas, intensifying trade-offs and driving the degradation of ES bundles. The most severe trade-offs are concentrated in rapidly urbanizing regions such as Kunshan and Changshu in northeastern Suzhou, where urban fringe expansion accelerates shifts from mild to severe trade-offs. This is driven by land-use changes and functional spillover effects from urban cores, like Gusu District. Some villages at the junction of Kunshan and the Industrial Park have undergone a leapfrogging development process, transitioning directly from key synergies to severe trade-offs between 2010 and 2022. This pattern underscores ecological risks and negative externalities associated with rapid urbanization in fringe areas. Addressing these challenges requires integrating ES synergistic management into urban–fringe–rural sustainability planning. Urban fringe areas serve as critical ecological buffers, mitigating urban pressures. Protecting key ecological nodes—such as water sources and biodiversity hotspots—helps maintain landscape connectivity and reduce ecosystem degradation. For example, enhancing ecological corridors, as seen in the European Green Belt, facilitates species migration and gene flow, balancing ecological integrity with development. Additionally, the intensive land-use changes in urban fringe areas necessitate adopting green infrastructure strategies. The intensive land-use changes in urban fringe areas necessitate adopting green infrastructure strategies. Green belts, parks, wetlands, and ecological buffers can enhance ecological resilience and mitigate urbanization’s environmental impact. These measures can improve both environmental quality and residents’ quality of life. In Suzhou, targeted green development can address ecological trade-offs and support urban-rural integration. Finally, integrated planning is essential for the irreversible ecological and social transitions in fringe areas. Policies should emphasize urban-rural resource complementarities, leveraging rural areas for food supply and regulating services, while urban areas provide cultural and economic benefits. Equitable distribution of public services and infrastructure, including transportation and green spaces, can foster synergy between urban and rural systems, as demonstrated by international models. These strategies offer a balanced approach to sustainable socio-economic and environmental development. While the proposed identifiable urban-fringe-rural framework effectively captures policy-driven metropolitan dynamics in Suzhou, its applicability to market-dominated cities or those with unique landscapes (e.g., mountainous or resource-depleted regions) requires further validation. Future efforts should prioritize two pathways: First, developing adaptive analytical modules tailored to different institutional contexts—for instance, incorporating land price indices in market-active areas and landslide risks in ecological corridors. Second, it is essential to engage stakeholders—including farmers, urban residents, government officials, and developers—in discussions about the findings and their views on ES trade-off decisions. Establishing a closed-loop system integrating “DNN identification-ES assessment-stakeholder engagement”, where resident preferences (collected through participatory platforms) directly inform model refinements, moving beyond post-hoc discussions. Finally, Additionally, the current semi-supervised model’s reliance on expert labeling could be optimized through disputed-area prioritization—focusing annotation efforts on ambiguous urban-rural transition zones rather than blanket sampling. This targeted approach maintains accuracy while enhancing scalability. In this research, multi-source geographic data and machine learning methods were emplyed to investigate the evolution of urban, fringe, and rural areas in Suzhou from 2010 to 2022. Key ESs and their interactions across urban–fringe–rural geospatial structures were analyzed, resulting in the identification of seven distinct ES bundles: key trade-offs bundle, mild trade-offs bundle, key synergistic bundle, CS-HA-LA bundle, HQ-LA bundle, water purification bundle, and FP bundle. These findings formed the basis for developing landscape optimization strategies to enhance synergies among ESs and promote sustainable urban-rural development. This study contributes to the literature in two significant ways. First, the DNN model-based identification method provides a refined approach for delineating urban–fringe–rural spatial structures across various scales and timeframes in metropolitan regions. Second, by employing a case-study approach, an innovative framework is presented for recognizing, evaluating, and managing dynamically evolving ES interactions, offering valuable guidance for sustainable urban–fringe–rural landscape planning and governance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s001 (JPG) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s002 (JPG) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s003 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s004 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s005 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s006 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s007 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s008 (ZIP)

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$109,465.18 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice. Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV). IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year. The broker now sees IREN’s AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner’s ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA). IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025. Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts. Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN’s 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

Time Published: 2025-09-24T12:45:36Z
Full Content:
Micron (MU) shares were little changed in premarket trading Wednesday after the memory chip maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and issued a rosy forecast amid surging AI-related demand. The company said late Tuesday it expects to generate fiscal first-quarter revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in well ahead of the $11.94 billion expected by analysts, with the guidance driven by booming demand for the company’s high-bandwidth memory chips and favorable pricing dynamics. Heading into the earnings report, the Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares had nearly doubled since the start of the year and surged 40% in September. The gains have been fueled by customers investing billions in AI chips to build data centers tasked with powering increasingly memory-intensive applications. The stock was down 0.2% at around $166 in recent premarket trading. Below, we use technical analysis to identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for. After finding support near the 50-day moving average, Micron shares trended sharply higher before consolidating in a pennant pattern over the past week. While this month’s strong uptrend has coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below its June peak, signaling that the stock has further room to climb. During Wednesday’s trading session, it’s worth watching out for a breakout above the pennant, a move that would indicate a continuation of the recent bullish move. Let’s turn to Micron’s chart to forecast an upside price target and also identify important support levels amid the possibility for earnings-related volatility. If a post-earnings breakout move occurs, investors can use bars pattern analysis to project an upside target. When applying the technique to Micron’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the strong move higher this month and reposition them from the pennant pattern’s top trendline. This forecasts a target of around $240, 44% above Tuesday’s closing price. We selected this earlier trend to predict how a continuation move higher may play out on the chart if the stock has a similar bullish upward leg. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially keep a close eye on the $155 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the pennant pattern and a brief pause in the stock’s strong uptrend earlier this month. Finally, selling below this level could spark a fall toward $129. Investors may seek to accumulate Micron shares in this location near the June and August peaks, which currently sit just above the upward sloping 50-day MA.

China’s top tech firm is spending even more than it originally planned on AI, turning up the heat on U.S. chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA) in the race to dominate the technology. Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) CEO Eddie Wu reportedly said Wednesday that the Chinese company has raised its AI budget to more than the $53 billion three-year outlay it announced in February. The spending plan marks the latest push by a tech firm to invest big in AI, the technology that has fueled U.S. stock markets to hit record highs. Nvidia said earlier this week it plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT owner OpenAI. “We are vigorously advancing a three-year, 380 billion [yuan] AI infrastructure initiative with plans to sustain and further increase our investment according to our strategic vision in anticipation of the [artificial superintelligence] era,” Wu said at Alibaba Cloud’s annual flagship technology conference, according to CNBC. The boom in AI spending by tech firms has helped propel the U.S. stock market to record highs this year. American tech firms are a big reason for this, but increasing spending on AI in China—by Alibaba and rivals like Baidu—is also behind this spending, and comments today from Alibaba's CEO indicate that it could continue. Wu has said he sees companies globally spending around $4 trillion globally on AI over the next five years, and “Alibaba needs to keep up,” Bloomberg said. Alibaba shares have more than doubled so far this year, as co-founder Jack Ma returned to Beijing's fold and the ecommerce giant doubled down on its "AI first strategy." On Wednesday, they rose 9% in intraday trading. Adding to the investor optimism, Cathie Wood's funds bought Alibaba shares, according to a daily trading report from her Ark Investment Management. Bloomberg noted it was the star fund manager's first purchase in the Chinese company in four years. Alibaba didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Title: GE Vernova Is Up 350%, But Can It Deliver?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/24/ge-vernova-is-up-350-but-can-it-deliver/
Time Published: 2025-09-24T12:30:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GE Vernova stock has experienced an impressive increase. Following its spin-off from General Electric in April 2024, the stock has risen over 350%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s gain of 27% during the same timeframe. The reasons behind this rally are obvious: electricity demand is on the rise, production capacity is expanding, profit margins are improving, and sustainability pledges offer the company a compelling long-term story. Collectively, these elements have driven the stock’s remarkable performance. However, investors should consider whether the market has already factored in these positives or if optimism has outstripped the underlying fundamentals. At its current price, GE Vernova is far from being a bargain. The stock trades at a P/E ratio of 151, a price-to-sales ratio of 4.7, and a price-to-free cash flow of 63. These multiples are significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages, suggesting that investors are wagering not on the company's present, but on its potential future role as a crucial component in the worldwide transition to electrification. Given such high expectations, even minor execution errors could negatively impact the stock. That said, investing in a single stock entails risks. For those investors seeking less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since its launch. As a whole, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, check out GOOGL Stock Vs. AMZN, MSFT & META At its essence, GE Vernova is an energy technology firm dedicated to the transition toward a lower-carbon future. Its four divisions - Power, Wind, Electrification Systems, and Energy Financial Services - encompass the technologies required to produce, transmit, and manage electricity. In summary, GE Vernova is central to the electrification and decarbonization movement. In September, the management revealed the sale of its Proficy industrial software unit to TPG for $600 million. This is a typical divestiture strategy: offload non-core assets and reinvest in what is essential. For GE Vernova, this entails a renewed emphasis on grid software and power systems, where demand is growing. Electricity demand is not decreasing, and GE Vernova is aware of this. The company is increasing its turbine production capacity from 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts by 2026, aiming to fulfill the rising demand, particularly in rapidly industrializing areas. GE Vernova also plays a pivotal role in the transition to clean energy. With 55,000 wind turbines and 7,000 gas turbines operational, its technology contributes to approximately 25% of global electricity generation. Additionally, the company is striving for carbon neutrality by 2030, aligning itself with the worldwide decarbonization movement. The second quarter confirmed investor optimism. Revenue increased by 12% to $12.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA rose by 25%, and net income reached $492 million. Management even elevated its year-end revenue forecast to $36–37 billion, indicating confidence that the growth momentum will persist. Upon closer inspection, orders totaling $12.4 billion indicated strong future demand. The backlog increased by $5.2 billion, primarily driven by robust performance in Gas Power. Free cash flow remained positive at $194 million, although this figure was down from the previous year due to one-time items. Not all divisions are excelling, however. The Wind segment is still facing difficulties, hindered by tariffs, rising service costs, and challenges in offshore markets. At the current valuation, expectations are exceedingly high. To maintain its premium, GE Vernova must execute with near-perfect precision — increasing production, safeguarding margins, and tackling ongoing issues in wind. For investors, this means being aware of the risks and understanding that the present price requires patience. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks, and a diversified approach may provide greater stability. You might consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an adaptable way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are edging higher after major indexes snapped a three-day streak of record highs; Micron Technology (MU) shares are in focus after the chipmaker posted record revenue on strong AI demand; Stable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking funding that would value the company at $500 billion; shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) are surging on its AI spending plans; and Lithium Americas (LAC) stock is soaring on a report that the U.S. government seeks to own a stake in the mining firm. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning after the market lost ground yesterday following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said the central bank faces challenges in determining interest rates as the labor market weakens while inflation remains elevated. Futures associated with the benchmark S&P 500, the tech-focused Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are pointing to a slightly higher opens for each of the major indexes. Gold futures, which have hit a series of record highs recently, ticked lower to around $3,800 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects a wide range of consumer loans, was little changed at 4.13%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $113,100 recently, up from an overnight low of around $111,000. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) posted record quarterly sales and delivered an optimistic outlook on surging demand for AI hardware. Micron reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, both above estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The partner to Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, also ahead of expectations. Shares of Micron, which have nearly doubled year-to-date, were down 1% in recent premarket trading. Stable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking to raise as much as $20 billion in private investment in a deal that could put the cryptocurrency firm’s value on par with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Bloomberg reported that the El Salvador-based company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in exchange for a 3% stake. The deal could see the company valued at $500 billion. In a social media post, CEO Paolo Ardoino said the funding would help scale by “several orders of magnitude” the firm’s business lines, which also included AI, commodity trading, energy, communications and media. Shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) surged after a report that the firm plans to boost its AI spending. Bloomberg reported that CEO Eddie Wu said the company would ramp up AI spending beyond the original plan announced in February of around $53 billion, as overall spending on the technology worldwide is expected to reach $4 trillion over the next five years. The company will invest in the development of AI models and infrastructure, including plans to build data centers in Brazil, France and the Netherlands, the report said. U.S.-traded shares of Alibaba were up more than 8% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Lithium Americas (LAC) soared in premarket trading on a report that the Trump administration may seek a stake in the mining company as part of a government loan deal. Reuters reported that the government may ask for a 10% stake in Lithium Americas as a condition in renegotiation talks over a $2.26 billion Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass lithium project with General Motors (GM). Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries and other key electronic equipment. The move would come after the Trump administration took a similar stake in chipmaker Intel (INTC). Shares of Lithium Americas were up 70% in recent premarket trading, while GM gained more than 2%.

Now, as Goldman Sacks warns of U.S. dollar collapse, Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley is gearing up to offer bitcoin and crypto trading in 2026. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are well underway in preparing to offer crypto trading through a partner model to E-Trade clients in the first half of 2026,” Jed Finn, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley, said in a memo seen by CNBC, adding that, “offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg.” At launch, E-Trade clients will be able to trade bitcoin, ethereum and solana, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told Reuters. Eventually, Morgan Stanley expects tokenized versions of traditional financial assets on blockchains will “significantly disrupt” the wealth management industry. “Tokenized substitutes for cash begin paying interest as soon as it hits the wallet. The rest of the asset classes will follow suit in seeking this efficiency," Finn wrote in the memo, echoing BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink who has said crypto-based tokenization will create a “revolution” on Wall Street. “We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around [blockchain’s distributed ledger technology] and tokenization more broadly." Morgan Stanley—which is among the most bullish of the Wall Street giants on bitcoin and crypto, making bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to its wealth advisors in August last year—will offer crypto trading on E-Trade through a partnership with Zerohash, an infrastructure provider for the digital assets. This week, Zerohash, which provides crypto trading, tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure for financial institutions, raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation in a round led by Interactive Brokers, it was reported by Fortune.

Title: Why Ethereum Treasuries Could Be The Next Big Business Strategy

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Ethereum treasuries are revolutionizing corporate finance, moving beyond idle Bitcoin holdings. Companies are now actively using ETH as a productive, yield-bearing asset through staking and DeFi lending, generating 3-5% returns. Liquid staking offers flexibility, allowing businesses to earn income while maintaining access to capital. This shift makes ETH a new, powerful tool for treasury management, impacting both large institutions and small businesses globally. Ethereum treasuries are quietly becoming one of the most consequential shifts in corporate finance. When the first corporate treasuries began buying Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs, it made headlines. Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square put digital gold on their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation and as a bet on a new monetary standard. Ethereum is quietly charting a different path (changing the world in different ways) that could prove even more transformative for corporate finance — and increasingly relevant for smaller businesses and investors too. According to the Block, nearly 70 organizations now hold more than 17 billion dollars worth of ETH directly, while ETFs account for another 25 billion. Together, close to 10% of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now under institutional control. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a familiar stock market product that lets investors buy and sell Ethereum the same way they trade Apple or Microsoft stock, without ever touching crypto directly. That scale is remarkable, but the real story lies in what institutions are doing with their ETH. Unlike Bitcoin, which often sits idle on corporate balance sheets, Ethereum treasuries are yield-bearing assets. Ethereum itself is more than just a digital coin. It is a programmable blockchain, like a global computer, where apps for finance, art, and identity are built. The coin, called ETH, is valuable both because it can be traded and because it powers those applications. According to Seeking Alpha, companies such as BitMine and SharpLink are now staking billions of dollars of ETH to generate predictable income streams. Staking is like putting money in a savings account, but instead of a bank paying you, the Ethereum network pays you for helping to keep it running. This is not speculation. It is balance sheet engineering. By staking or lending ETH, treasuries reduce circulating liquidity while creating new sources of revenue. According to Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, “Liquid staking captures the true magic of internet money and delivers it to asset managers on a silver platter. Institutional funds can now hold Ethereum that grows in value while staying liquid, a combination that traditional finance has never been able to offer. It is no wonder this strategy is spreading like wildfire across the globe.” According to Yellow.com, when ETH is staked, it generates yields in the range of 3 to 5%, often more than government bonds. ETH can also be deployed into lending markets, collateralized for credit, or structured into financial products. Traditional staking locks ETH away, which can be a problem if a company suddenly needs access to its capital. This is where liquid staking comes in. Think of it like a CD at the bank. With a CD, you earn interest but cannot touch the money until it matures. Liquid staking is like earning that same interest, but also getting a certificate you can borrow against, trade, or even spend while your deposit keeps working for you. For businesses, this is powerful because treasuries often need flexibility. They may want yield but also need to cover expenses or seize an opportunity on short notice. Liquid staking gives them both: productive assets and working capital. In Europe, liquid staking products have already been wrapped into regulated funds and exchange-traded products, allowing family offices and corporates to adopt the strategy without losing liquidity. Examples include Lido’s stETH and Rocket Pool’s rETH, which give holders a token they can move freely while still earning staking rewards. European adoption shows that liquid staking is not theory but an established practice that provides a roadmap for U.S. institutions. This matters well beyond Fortune 500 CFOs. A local business with extra reserves could stake a small amount of ETH to earn yield, much like putting idle cash to work in a savings account. A nonprofit could hold a fraction of its treasury in Ethereum ETFs to diversify beyond cash and bonds. Everyday investors could treat ETH staking like a higher-yield alternative to a bank account, understanding that the risks are different but the principle is similar — turning savings into income. Paul Frambot, CEO and co-founder of Morpho, the second largest lending protocol, emphasizes why risk safeguards are central here. “For institutions to adopt ETH treasuries at scale, they need the same credit and liquidity safeguards they expect in traditional finance. We are already seeing fintechs use DeFi lending as infrastructure, and corporate treasuries are following the same path. The difference is that Ethereum gives them programmable and transparent rails.” Institutions are beginning to establish a treasury playbook for Ethereum. Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs and core contributor behind Spark, explains the two most important sources of yield in practice. “When it comes to ETH, most of the fundamental yield comes from staking. I expect that actually to expand as more use cases in crypto come. Then there are onchain crypto lending markets such as SparkLend. These are people who are borrowing stablecoins. They have some ETH or Bitcoin, and want more exposure to the asset. So they’ll borrow stablecoins on an onchain market, and lever up that way, and they’re usually willing to pay a premium on top of the more base rate in TradFi.” These playbooks are not just about squeezing out returns. They point to a deeper shift in how companies treat digital assets. ETH is not simply something to hold on the side of the balance sheet. It is becoming a productive working asset. For investors, that means ETH is starting to look less like a speculative token and more like a hybrid between a growth stock and a bond — combining upside with regular yield. For businesses, it means treasury management is evolving. Where once the choice was between cash, bonds, or equities, ETH now represents a new category. Kean Gilbert, Head of Institutional Relations at the Lido Ecosystem Foundation, highlights this rotation. “Institutional money is rotating into Ethereum because ETH is both productive and liquid. That is a major change from Bitcoin reserves. This is not just holding crypto, it is re-engineering corporate digital asset strategy around programmable yield.” Several hurdles still need to be addressed. Risk management remains central, from validator penalties to smart contract exploits. Liquidity versus lockup is a real tradeoff, since staking yields require time commitments and occasional withdrawal delays. Liquid staking reduces this friction, but it still introduces complexity and counterparty risk. Regulation adds another layer of uncertainty. The SEC has raised questions about whether staking counts as a securities offering, while Europe has taken a more favorable approach with Ethereum ETFs and liquid staking products. Finally, governance questions remain: who decides how ETH treasuries are deployed, the CFO, the board, or specialized committees? Ethereum treasuries are becoming the next big business strategy. ETH serves a dual role: a strategic reserve asset and a yield-bearing instrument. That combination is powerful. In the coming years, we may see treasuries managed like corporate bond portfolios, balancing staking, lending, liquid staking, and ETF exposure. Platforms such as Lido, Spark, and Morpho may emerge as the BlackRock or Fidelity equivalents of Ethereum treasuries, building the rails that allow adoption at scale. More broadly, Ethereum is evolving into the financial operating system for balance sheets — from global corporations to local businesses to everyday investors. Ethereum treasuries are not simply digital reserves. They represent a new kind of financial strategy: programmable, productive, and accessible. The question is no longer whether ETH belongs in a portfolio, but how much, and how to manage it responsibly at scale. Ethereum treasuries will impact the markets.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) BTC$109,465.18 rebounded from Asian session lows of $111,000 to $112,800, repeating a pattern seen on Tuesday. However, the token remains below its 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with liquidity analysis and retail crowd sentiment signaling a potential for a deeper pullback. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, standing at 4,027. Two notable developments have emerged. The competition between on-chain decentralized exchanges Hyperliquid and Aster has intensified, with Aster surpassing Hyperliquid in daily revenue. According to DefiLlama, Aster generated $7.2 million in revenue in the past 24 hours compared to Hyperliquid’s $2.79 million. This divergence is also reflected in their native tokens: ASTR’s market cap has soared from $931 million to $3.74 billion in seven days, while HYPE’s market cap has dropped from $14.88 billion to $11.73 billion. ASTR has surged 37% over 24 hours, the best performance among the top 100 tokens by market cap, whereas HYPE ranked among the worst performers. In recent months, Hyperliquid has lost market share to competitors like Aster and Lighter, making this an area investors should watch closely. Meanwhile, data from CryptoRank shows Solana’s launchpad activity has sharply declined, with combined volume hitting a four-month low of $117 million. Active wallets have fallen below 100,000, and daily token project graduates – projects that have successfully completed their initial fundraising or token sale phases and moved on to public trading – have dropped to just 88, indicating reduced user engagement and fewer new launches. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, challenged the idea of a broad crypto bull market, emphasizing that the 2025 rally is narrow and selective, focused on certain coins backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset trusts (DATs) such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. In traditional markets, the U.S. dollar rose 0.4%, likely influenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks on rate cuts earlier in the week. Nasdaq futures showed gains, offering risk-on cues to the crypto market. Stay alert!

Title: 3 Ways Companies Can Support Working Mothers Facing Rigid RTO Mandates

ByLiz Elting, Contributor. Juggling family and work responsibilities continues to be a constant challenge for many working parents, especially mothers. According to FlexJobs’ “Working Parents Report,” half of U.S. professionals say working mothers face higher standards than working fathers, while only 17% say the reverse. The report also found that over half of working women feel they shoulder the most responsibilities at both work and home, and that over half of working parents downplay caregiving duties to their employer to appear more committed. What’s more, recent return-to-office (RTO) mandates implemented this year by companies like JPMorgan, Amazon, and AT&T may further undermine work-life balance and gender equity for working parents, particularly for working mothers with young children who often rely on flexible work options to help balance work and family responsibilities. According to research from The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution, one-third of prime-age women (ages 25-54) with children under five telework, and both mothers and fathers with young children are more likely to work remotely than other adults. Meanwhile, Flex Index’s Q3 2025 “Flex Report” found that nearly half of Fortune 100 companies now require in-office work four to five days a week, and the Federal Reserve’s latest “Beige Book” notes that many firms are using RTO mandates to reduce headcount in place of formal layoffs. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that, as RTO mandates took effect this year, labor force participation among mothers of young children saw the steepest 6-month decline in over 40 years, dropping three percentage points between January and June 2025, according to data from the Care Board. As RTO mandates make it increasingly difficult for many mothers to remain in the workforce, companies should consider taking concrete steps to create more equitable workplaces for parents. As companies roll out company-wide RTO mandates, it’s critical that they recognize how these mandates can disproportionately impact working parents, especially mothers, who often rely on flexibility to balance caregiving responsibilities. Without flexible options, strict in-office requirements risk pushing talent out of the workforce or forcing parents to choose between prioritizing work and family. To counter this, companies should consider offering flexible work options to employees who would benefit most from them, such as working parents. According to FlexJobs’ report, 72% of working parents say flexible hours would better support them, and 65% believe remote or hybrid work would help them in their roles. FlexJobs author Kirsten Chorpenning describes flexible work as an “essential tool” that enables parents to stay in the workforce and grow in their careers, rather than stepping back due to inflexible demands. And as previously reported, in addition to more flexible workplace policies, interim executive and fractional leadership positions also offer working mothers the ability to work temporarily or part-time without having to forego leadership roles and career advancement. By embedding flexibility into workplaces, even within the framework of broader RTO plans, companies can reduce the negative impact those mandates can have on working parents and foster a more inclusive and supportive workplace that benefits everyone. After all, research shows that employees perform better when properly supported. As companies enforce RTO mandates, many working mothers are forced into difficult decisions between their families and their careers, and with rising childcare costs, many of those who don’t want to give up their careers are left with few options. Consequently, women who would have otherwise chosen to continue working are exiting the workforce to meet caregiving demands. According to Care.com’s “2025 Cost of Care Report,” the average cost of childcare (including nannies, daycares, and family care centers) now consumes 22% of household income, making the shift back to in-office work not just a logistical burden, but a financial one as well. FlexJobs’ findings reinforce this reality, with nearly half of U.S. professionals saying they would more likely stay in a role that offered employer-sponsored childcare. Providing subsidized childcare is another vital way for employers to support working parents, helping to reduce financial strains and potentially improve retention among working parents. In fact, Care.com’s report found that 79% of parents believe employers can reduce childcare expenses through subsidizing the cost of caregiving. Ultimately, when companies invest in employer-sponsored childcare, they’re more likely to foster a more equitable workforce as RTO mandates take effect. This in turn benefits employers, who see greater employee retention, morale and performance. Companies should also consider implementing active-listening strategies that encourage open dialogue between leadership and employees. This includes regular one-on-one meetings to better understand each employee’s individual needs and build stronger connections, as well as frequent surveys to gather feedback. These tactics can help leaders understand specific benefits their teams are seeking and may provide insight into the unique challenges their employees are facing and what can be done to support them so they can do their best work. Improving communication with work teams can also help companies avoid broad, one-size-fits-all approaches that rarely work for everyone. For example, as previously reported, remote work can sometimes hinder rather than help women’s careers, since women often receive higher pay raises and more mentorship opportunities when they are physically present with coworkers. Therefore, while remote work might benefit some working mothers, it could also limit a woman just entering the workforce by reducing opportunities for guidance and career development. This underscores the importance of listening to and communicating with employees and offering flexible solutions so that each employee can perform at their best. It enables employers to understand what is and isn’t working for each individual, rather than applying blanket approaches that can hinder productivity, such as company-wide RTO mandates. Prioritizing individual employee needs doesn’t only benefit employees, it improves business outcomes. According to Future Forward Institute’s report titled “The Competitive Advantage of the Win-Win Workplace,” companies that invest in employee-focused benefits and work environments tend to achieve higher profitability. Despite recent setbacks, the long-term trend of more working mothers joining the labor force remains strong. Per the Care Board’s data, labor force participation among mothers of young children has risen from 58.9% in 1989 to 68.2% in 2025, marking decades of progress in workplace inclusion and gender equity. If companies choose to support working mothers now, this backslide will simply be a temporary stumble rather than a longer lasting fall. By embracing responsive, flexible and supportive workplace practices, employers can help ensure that progress for all working parents continues to build rather than unravel.

Title: Amazon’s fall hardware event: 5 Echo devices due for an upgrade

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. After skipping last year, Amazon is back with a big fall hardware event slated for next week, and we’re expecting plenty of new Echo smart speakers and displays that make the most of Alexa+, Amazon’s AI revamp of the Alexa voice assistant. Plenty of other hardware will also be unwrapped during Amazon’s September 30 event in New York City; for example, we’re sure to see new Kindle tablets, as well as Fire TV models and perhaps even some Ring cameras. For now, though, we’re concentrating on new Echo devices, and there are a few popular Echo speakers and displays that are ripe for an upgrade. We’re most interested in how the latest Echo hardware will take full advantage of Alexa+, the generative AI-enhanced Alexa that can carry on flowing conversations, take actions on your behalf, and control smart home devices based on natural-language commands. (It’s worth noting that most existing Echo speakers and displays already are compatible with Alexa+, so there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you don’t want to.) There haven’t been many leaks or rumors about specific new Echo devices we might see next week. That said, we do have a bead on some older but nonetheless popular Echo speakers and displays that are in dire need of a refresh. What is it: Amazon’s flagship Echo speaker that doubles as a smart home hub Latest release: 2020 (fourth generation) List price: $99.99 Michael Brown/Foundry It’s been nearly five years since Amazon released a new version of its top-of-the-line Echo, making it the oldest speaker in Amazon’s current Echo lineup. It’s high time for a new one. A larger version of the popular and inexpensive Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo shares many of the Dot’s features, including motion detection, a temperature sensor, and the ability to extend the range of Amazon’s line of Eero mesh Wi-Fi routers. The Echo also houses stereo tweeters and a three-inch woofer, making for a nice upgrade to the Echo Dot’s so-so audio performance. But the Echo has an ace up its sleeve: a full-on Zigbee home hub, capable of directly controlling Zigbee lights, sensors, switches, and other Zigbee-enabled devices. The Echo also packs a Thread radio, allowing it to act as a Thread border router. Plunk an Echo in your living room, and you have everything you need to launch your smart home—well, aside from a Z-Wave radio, which would be a cool feature for an updated Echo. (We’re not holding on breath on that one, as Z-Wave is not embraced by the Matter standard.) An all-new Echo would seem like a no-brainer for Amazon’s hardware event next week, complete with beefier hardware for smoother Alexa+ performance and perhaps even a physical makeover. What it is: Amazon’s budget-priced Echo workhorse Latest release: 2022 (fifth generation) List price: $49.99 Ben Patterson/Foundry If the Echo is Amazon’s flagship smart speaker, the Echo Dot is its smaller sibling, shedding the Zigbee smart hub but keeping the motion and temperature sensors as well as the Eero mesh extender functionality. Priced at $50 but often on sale for much less, the Echo Dot is a smart choice for putting Alexa in every room, what with its handsome design and good-enough audio performance. There are now cheaper Echos in Amazon’s lineup—see the $40 Echo Pop from 2023—but the Echo Dot hits the sweet spot in terms of price and performance. Now that it’s due to celebrate its third birthday, the Echo Dot is primed for a new Alexa+-enhanced version. I could see it sharing the same overall design as the new Echo—smaller form factor, of course—with a modest audio upgrade and even a Thread border router functionality, which would allow the Dot to act as a hub for Matter devices. What it is: A premium Echo speaker that does Dolby Atmos Latest release: 2023 (second generation) List price: $199.99 (no longer available) Amazon If you want an Amazon Echo speaker that can truly put on a sonic show, the Dolby Atmos-enabled Echo Studio is the obvious choice—if you can find one, that is. The second-generation Echo Studio has been out of stock for months now, making it a prime candidate for a makeover. Packing three two-inch mid-range speakers, a 20mm tweeter, and a 5.25-inch woofer, the Echo Studio has all the drivers its needs to belt out audiophile-quality sound. The Echo Studio isn’t just a great music speaker, though. Like the Echo, it offers a Zigbee home hub and a Matter hub. An upgraded version of the Studio with Alexa+ playing DJ could be a highlight of Amazon’s hardware event next week. What it is: An Echo display with a pivoting screen that follows you around the room Latest release: 2021 (third generation) List price: $249.99 (no longer available) Michael Brown/Foundry Hard to believe, but it’s been four years since the Echo Show 10 made its debut, and boy was it a showstopper. Yes, the Echo Show 10 boasts such smart home features as a Zigbee hub and a Thread border router (the unit’s Matter-over-Thread abilities were enabled after launch), 2.1-channel audio, a 13-megapixel camera, and an impressive 10-inch screen. But its killer feature was its swiveling display, which could follow you as you strolled around the room. That rotating display made the Echo Show 10 feel like the most aware Echo device yet, so just imagine how that would play with Alexa+ on board, looking out into your kitchen and making suggestions as you prepare a gourmet meal. Sure, Alexa+ can already work on the existing third-gen Echo Show 10, but we’re eager to see a new take on that motorized design. As with the Echo Studio, the Echo Show 10 has been unavailable via Amazon for some time, leading us to believe that a fourth generation of the display is imminent. What is it: Amazon’s Alexa-powered smart glasses Latest release: 2023 (third generation) List price: Varies depending upon style Ben Patterson/Foundry With the likes of Meta’s camera-enabled AI glasses on the scene, Amazon’s audio-only Echo Frames are looking decidedly old hat these days. First announced back in 2019, the Echo Frames came with a handsome design and mini speakers and microphones in the temples that promised to put Alexa in your head. The most recent release from 2023 offered updated looks and plenty of audio refinements, and the Frames are now compatible with Alexa+. Still, the basic conceit and limitations remain: it’s Alexa (or Alexa+) in your head, and only in your head. Meta, meanwhile, has supercharged the market for smart glasses that allow an AI companion to see the world around you, offering commentary and insights wherever you go (even if the results are a tad uneven). Will Amazon take the fight to Meta with vision-enabled Echo Frames with Alexa+? It’s a bit of a long shot, but I’m not ruling it out.

Open Semantic Interchange looks to change things for the better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In recognition of the rise of agentic AI and the shift away from traditional dashboards and reports, Salesforce and Snowflake have teamed up with BlackRock, dbt Labs and RelationalAI to change things for the better when it comes to collaboration. Together, the group is launching Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), which Snowflake describes as a vendor-neutral framework that allows different platforms to talk to one another in the same language. The launch of OSI comes as companies struggle with vendor lock-ins, which create silos and limit the potential of AI tools. “With the Open Semantic Interchange initiative, we are proud to be leading the charge alongside our partners to solve a foundational challenge for AI – the lack of a common semantic standard,” Snowflake EVP of Product Christian Kleinerman commented. The initiative’s key goals are to improve interoperability, reduce complexity and boost AI adoption “by standardizing how semantics are defined and exchanged.” It’s also a futureproofing initiative in more ways than one – Salesforce cited Accenture research predicting AI agents will be the primary users of enterprise software by 2030, ahead of humans. “These new intelligent workers are only as effective as the data they can access and understand,” Tableau Chief Product Officer Southard Jones explained. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! To support bi-directional metadata exchange, the OSI standardizes data metrics, dimensions, hierarchies and relationships. Snowflake highlighted the five core principles of OSI: standardization (common language and structure); interoperability (easy exchange between tools); extensibility (adaptable to evolving needs); open source (collaborative development); and domain-specific models (to combine data from various sources). Jones likened the Open Semantic Interchange to the Rosetta Stone for business data: “By co-leading the Open Semantic Interchange with Snowflake and our partners, we’re building the foundation every AI agent and BI application needs: a common semantic framework that preserves meaning across platforms.” With several years’ experience freelancing in tech and automotive circles, Craig’s specific interests lie in technology that is designed to better our lives, including AI and ML, productivity aids, and smart fitness.

Title: The 20 financial firms that could be hardest hit from Trump's new H-1B fee — from Goldman Sachs to Citi

Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas. Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, "caught everyone off guard," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week. In order to visualize the potential impact on the financial industry, Business Insider turned to publicly available data from the Department of Labor and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The data covers H-1B application data for the first three quarters of the government fiscal year 2025, as well as the less-common H-1B1 and E-3 visas, from October of 2024 to the end of June this year. We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands. The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Major banks like Chase and Goldman Sachs dominate the list alongside major payments companies like American Express. Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and research and ratings agency Moody's, help to round it out. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI. Certified applications: 2,440 Employees worldwide: 317,160 as of the second quarter of 2025 The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. The bank also filed visa applications for the firm's main business lines, such as an investment banking managing director. Certified applications: 1,575 Employees worldwide: Over 78,000 per its website Fidelity submitted a wide range of applications for technical roles, with 40 certified applications for full-stack engineering directors and 125 for full-stack engineering principals. Non-technical roles included a director of marketing. Certified applications: 1,280 Employees worldwide: 45,900 as of the second quarter of 2025 Not all of Goldman Sachs' certified applications specified the role, focusing instead on the level of hire, such as an associate. The data, however, does show a wide range of technologist hires and financial hires, including many vice president-level banking roles. Certified applications: 921 Employees worldwide: 75,100 as of the end of 2024 American Express's certified applications were largely for technologist roles, with more than 125 for"engineer" roles. Business Insider also found applications for non-technical roles, including director-level applications for risk management, communications, and controller. Certified applications: 874 Employees worldwide: 229,000 as of the end of 2024 Citi's certified applications also largely focused on technology roles, including more than 150 certified applications for "Application Development Technical Lead Analyst" roles. Certified applications: 871 Employees worldwide: 76,500 as of the second quarter of 2025 Like others on this list, Capital One's certified applications largely focused on technology and data roles. The data showed hundreds of applications for data science and analysis roles, as well as some less technical roles like "business manager." Certified applications: 770 Employees worldwide: 31,600 as of the end of 2024 Visa is yet another company largely focused on tech and data hires. Some non-technical roles include compensation business analysts, senior financial analysts, and managers. Certified applications: 718 Employees worldwide: 213,000 as of the second quarter of 2025 Bank of America also focused its applications on tech hiring. Their most common role on the list, a vice president-level software engineer III, could be found on over 100 applications. Certified applications: 673 Employees worldwide: 80,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors. Certified applications: 624 Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing. Certified applications: 457 Employees worldwide: 92,900 as of the end of 2024 The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Some front-office hires included an equities derivatives trader and an equities "exotic" trader. Certified applications: 434 Employees worldwide: 32,600 per the firm's website Charles Schwab is also using H-1B visa to hire tech talent, with the data showing nearly 50 software development and engineering senior manager roles and nearly 100 software development and engineering manager hires. We were unable to find a single role that didn't appear to be related to technology. Certified applications: 391 Employees worldwide: 217,000 at the end of 2024 Wells Fargo joins the ranks of financial firms largely focused on technological hires in its H-1B visa applications. The data also showed certified applications for roles like lead securities trader and strategy and planning director. Certified applications: 339 Employees worldwide: 110,323 as of the end of 2024 UBS had certified applications for a slew of tech and financial roles. On the financial side, it has applied for roles like investment banking analyst and associate, the entry-level role to a banking career, as well as an associate director of global markets FX trading. Certified applications: 294 Employees worldwide: Approximately 22,000 per the firm's website. Like Morgan Stanley, BlackRock only provides the level of roles hired. The bulk of roles culled by Business Insider were at the associate or vice president level, though there are also more than 20 director-level applications. Certified applications: 213 Employees worldwide: Approximately 53,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 State Street's visa applications were largely focused on technology hires, though financial roles were also on the menu. Non-financial roles included applications for a head of internal liquidity stress testing in treasury and a global head of liquidity risk oversight. Certified applications: 209 Employees worldwide: Approximately 20,000 per the firm's website as of the end of 2024 A large chunk of Vanguard's applications were for application engineering and other technical roles. The asset management firm also had applications for a fixed-income trader, a head of wealth management and advice, and a head of fraud, strategy, and analytics. Certified applications: 199 Employees worldwide: 15,838 at the end of 2024 The ratings and research powerhouse joins the rest on the list with a focus on technologists. Senior software engineers and staff software engineers lead the way in certified applications. Some non-technical applications included a director-level sales manager, a credit associate, and a commercial real estate researcher. Certified applications: 185 Employees worldwide: 38,335 as of the end of 2024 Software engineering roles made up roughly half of Truist's applications reviewed by Business Insider. Most other roles were tech-focused, such as a senior data analyst in liquidity and regulatory reporting, though there were some rare non-tech roles, such as Treasury market and liquidity risk officer. Certified applications: 144 Employees worldwide: 21,000 as of the end of 2024 Discover joins the ranks of others on this list with roughly 100 applications mentioning data science. Other interesting technical roles included a lead robotic process automation analyst. Jump to

Title: Erdogan’s frustrations, Netanyahu and the opposition, what (and where) Geroulanos is shaking, Xenokostas and the Americans, the field cots ///

Hello, as of the time we were writing our daily news report, we did not yet have a definitive picture of whether the postponed meeting between Mitsotakis and Erdogan would take place, but generally speaking, there’s a Greek proverb about the …ship that’s late. Still, from what a government source said late last night, it doesn’t look good. So we know for certain that indeed the scheduled meeting yesterday evening at 9 (Greek time) was postponed for a real reason. Trump scheduled his meeting with the Arab countries at roughly the same time Mitsotakis was supposed to meet Erdogan (with half an hour’s difference), so of course the Turk wouldn’t ditch that meeting for the Greek Prime Minister. In the end, however, the American President’s meeting with the Arab leaders was delayed by about an hour and a half, which meant both Erdogan and Trump slotted in other meetings in the meantime. But we also know just as well that if Erdogan couldn’t “find”… half an hour today in his schedule for this meeting, it simply means the Turk never wanted it to happen in the first place. Not good, but of course not …the end of the world if the Turk doesn’t want to meet the Greek. And in that sense, the opposition’s reaction, just half an hour after the postponement was announced and before they even knew that the meeting was definitively off, is beyond words. Or rather, it’s a disgrace for the country that only a few minutes later Greek parties attack the Greek Prime Minister because the Turk canceled on him. Honestly, I don’t believe public opinion would have expected such an “instant” reaction from the opposition (from PASOK to Velopoulos) in order to applaud them — given one small detail: let’s not forget, we’re talking about a Greek and a Turk.

Clearstream, Deutsche Börse Group’s post-trade services provider, announces that it will add funds from global asset manager, BlackRock, to its platform, aimed at broadening the distribution of BlackRock’s alternative investment solutions. 0 24 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. This will leverage Clearstream Fund Services’ robust and reliable distribution infrastructure to process funds securely and efficiently at scale, simplifying wealth manager access to private market funds.

Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is being integrated into tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock and VanEck, giving holders of the products a direct redemption path into on-chain liquidity. Through a new smart contract on Securitize’s platform, investors in BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL funds can now swap their shares for RLUSD on demand, creating what Ripple calls a 24/7 stablecoin off-ramp for tokenized treasuries. The move positions RLUSD as a settlement layer for real-world assets (RWA) while broadening its institutional footprint. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, said in a prepared statement thathe tie-up “is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” framing RLUSD as regulatory-compliant and enterprise-grade. RLUSD — backed 1:1 with liquid reserves and issued under a New York DFS trust charter — has climbed past $700 million in circulation since launching last year. Ripple has been pushing its use in cross-border payments and DeFi pools, while now anchoring it to institutional RWA platforms. The Securitize tie-in also sets up RLUSD for deployment on the XRP Ledger, giving Ripple a dual push of a regulatory-compliant stablecoin issuance on one side, and DeFi-facing usability on the other.

Title: Engagement-based advertising models are coming for AI

Frank - stock.adobe.com When Alphabet reported a 14% spike in second-quarter revenue this year, Google’s boss rushed to praise the role of artificial intelligence (AI). The technology is “positively impacting every part of the business”, said CEO Sundar Pichai. But that isn’t the reality for most firms. What’s more, the AI investment market is veering deeper into bubble territory. Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has warned that tech giants are staring at a brutal reckoning on Wall Street. “The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,” he wrote to clients this summer, invoking the lead-up to the ruinous dot com crash. That market correction destroyed a generation of companies and erased $5tn in share value – roughly equal to $9.3tn today. Others are more blunt. “I am not here to belittle AI, it’s the future, and I recognise that we’re just scratching the surface in terms of what it can do,” the chief of hedge fund Praetorian Capital has written about the hazy economics of data centres. “I also recognise massive capital misallocation when I see it. I recognise insanity, I recognise hubris.” The grand payoff from generative AI (GenAI) is proving especially elusive. A study published by MIT in August suggests only 5% of businesses using it have seen rapid revenue acceleration. Still, the tech industry is notching up imperfect progress in models’ capabilities. And personal use of AI by consumers is steadily growing. Executives are thus roaring ahead with their mammoth spending plans. Even without a clear path to profitability, leading US tech companies plan to drop a staggering $344bn into AI this year. That figure will reportedly rise to half a trillion dollars in 2026. “As long as we’re on this very distinct curve of the model getting better and better, I think the rational thing to do is to just be willing to run the loss for quite a while,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman the day after his organisation released GPT-5. OpenAI’s own projections show it’s expected to burn through $115bn by the end of 2029. “None of this means that AI can’t eventually be as transformative as its biggest boosters claim,” points out business writer Rogé Karma. “But ‘eventually’ could turn out to be a long time.” And tech companies’ meteoric valuations can’t defy economic gravity forever. A foolproof way then to bankroll themselves within the attention economy is for tech companies to infuse advertising into models’ outputs. Indeed, some firms are already experimenting with the concept as they jockey to win the most costly industrial competition in history. The expansion of digital advertising is not an intrinsically bad thing. Done transparently and within clear guidelines, ads function as a beneficial form of free expression. They can also democratise consumer choice, drive innovation and spur competition within markets. Yet Meta’s recent decision to abandon its moratorium on advertising in WhatsApp is a possible harbinger of things to come. Meta resisted introducing ads into WhatsApp for over a decade after acquiring the app in 2014. Its ad-free experience, after all, was key to it becoming the world’s most popular messaging service. But that all changed earlier this year. Seeking to bolster Meta’s war chest in the AI arms race, CEO Mark Zuckerberg lifted the ban in June. Markets instantly rewarded his decision with a 2.5% bump in Meta’s stock price. Meta says ads on WhatsApp will not interrupt chats. Plus, users’ personal information won’t be given to advertisers. Yet Meta’s policy U-turn is a reminder that even the world’s tech juggernauts are beholden to market sentiments. “If you look at the trajectory of Google and Microsoft, it’s not a matter of ‘if’ ads end up in AI outputs, but how quickly and how deeply they get embedded,” says Adio Dinika, a researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR). “The driver isn’t user benefit; it’s the survival of an ad-tech business model that has monopolised the internet for two decades.” Others concur. “This shouldn’t be surprising,” says Daniel Barcay, executive director of the Center for Humane Technology, pointing to the evolutionary arc of social media. “The industry is moving from a phase of explosive expansion and onboarding to a phase of more zero-sum competition between AI platforms. “We see this pattern over and over again,” he says, “precisely because the aggregate value of a technology product is far greater than the user subscriptions – as soon as growth slows, the race for monetisation becomes more vicious and more hidden.” Elsewhere, a recently leaked memo from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei confirms how easily ideals can be hollowed out. He and six of his colleagues founded Anthropic in 2021 after leaving OpenAI over concerns the latter was straying from its stated mission to develop safe, human-centred systems. Amodei even wrote last autumn that “AI-powered authoritarianism seems too terrible to contemplate”. However, in a Slack message sent by Amodei to his staff in July 2025, he justified the company courting investment money from “dictators” in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to remain a leader in AI. “This is a real downside and I’m not thrilled about it,” wrote Amodei. “Unfortunately, I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Citing the need for a “steady and scalable” revenue stream, Perplexity last November introduced ads into its AI-powered search results as prompts for sponsored follow-up questions. Google likewise began inserting sponsored content into its AI Overviews this past May. The search giant cites internal data that it claims shows users appreciate this because it helps them swiftly connect with relevant businesses, products and services. Yet chatbots are even better at accruing what brands and advertisers seek most: intimacy and trust. In his book Nexus, which explores how AI could radically reshape human information networks, historian Yuval Noah Harari invokes the unnerving example of former Google engineer Blake Lemoine. In mid-2022, Lemoine became convinced the chatbot he was working on, LaMDA, had become conscious, and it genuinely feared being disconnected. Lemoine was fired after going public with his feelings. In the contest for hearts and minds, Harari writes, intimacy is a powerful weapon. “By conversing and interacting with us, computers could form intimate relationships with people and then use the power of intimacy to influence us,” he warns. This is already evident in the new phenomenon of so-called AI psychosis. The number of users caught in grandiose delusions of chatbots sending them on secret missions or forging connections with spiritual beings is skyrocketing. An even higher number are developing friendships and romantic entanglements. Too often, these scenarios end tragically. In early August, OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 – which amalgamates the company’s prior model iterations under one program – angered hardcore ChatGPT users who had built a personal attachment to GPT-4o. The earlier model was widely criticised, including by Sam Altman himself, as being sycophantic. “Even after customising instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same,” one Reddit user said about GPT-5 in a now-deleted post. “It’s more technical, more generalised, and honestly feels emotionally distant.” Another Reddit post reads: “For a lot of people, 4.0 [sic] was the first thing that actually listened … It responded with presence. It remembered. It felt like talking to someone who cared.” OpenAI quickly reversed course after the backlash, enabling paid users to now self-select GPT-4o as their default version. This addictive hold that AI systems have over some users mirrors the toxic legacy of algorithmic targeting of content on social media platforms. And yet it also has the potential to go much further. “The intimacy of conversational AI creates unprecedented vectors for exploitation, systems that know your sleep patterns, your relationship anxieties, your financial stress, your health fears,” says Dinika, the AI researcher. “When those vulnerabilities become targeting parameters for advertisers, we’re not talking about so-called ‘relevant ads’ – we’re talking about weaponised psychology at scale.” Indeed, AI ads can and will do far more than just inject links into text streams, predicts Barcay, from the Center for Humane Technology. “AI ad systems can subtly shift the tone, language and content of a conversation to elevate the prominence of products, industries, cultural figures or political parties. They can steer discussions with users towards or away from topics, amplify desires, invoke associations.” This could be aggravated further in a future when conversant humanoid robots take up the roles of assistants, educators and caregivers. But policymakers still have a window to act. This is pertinent given how US courts have ordered Google to share search data with its rivals, liberating all kinds of new material for AI developers to expedite their projects. “If policymakers have learned anything, it should be that disclosure has to be front and centre in the output itself, not buried,” says Dinika. He suggests placing strict limits on using conversational data for targeting while prohibiting advertising in sensitive areas like health, immigration, or finance. AI’s immense capabilities and intimate access to consumers will also likely trigger deeper questions about the very nature of the advertising industry itself. “I imagine that many legal battles will be fought in this area in the years to come about what defines the limits of an ad,” says Barcay. This might encompass “what denotes proper disclosure, what aspects of a user’s interaction are fair game to be used, and what reinforcement signals can be used to tune a model towards persuasive salesman-like behaviours”. Ultimately, regulators should get in front of AI advertising before any nascent problems grow too big to handle, advises Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson, who argues that tech companies will inevitably claim that advertising is a necessary part of democratising AI. If not, she says, “we’ll repeat the mistakes made with social media – scrutinising the fallout of a lucrative business model only after the damage is done”.

Title: Miriam Lord: Maria Steen, opponent of marriage equality and abortion, championed as a symbol of choice

It was a busy morning for the men of Independent Ireland. The fab four woke, heads spinning, after a private meeting the previous night with Maria Steen of the Iona Institute – a stylish last-minute entrant into the narrowing race to secure a place on the presidential election ticket. This was high-stakes, highwire stuff. The media was on full alert. Independent Ireland issued a communique first thing on Tuesday saying it would be holding a press call on the Leinster House Plinth at 12.15pm to announce its decision on the nomination. Could things get any more exciting? Well, yes. Because another communique had landed, this time from the Healy-Rae camp. The vote of the Kilgarvan jury was in. Danny himself would be in the vicinity of the Plinth at midday to announce the unanimous result of his personal ruminations on the same issue. In fact, he would be available for publicity purposes from the front door all the way down to the pavement outside the Kildare Street gates. At the appointed time, the three Indyeye members did the requisite business-like strut to the microphones (Michael Fitzmaurice was missing) to declare the party is backing Steen. Deputy Fitzmaurice was at the previous evening’s hush-hush consultation with the Catholic think-tank’s star performer “Royal Ascot meets Ballinrobe Races,” was how one observer summed up the freshly-forged alliance between the defenders of rural Ireland and the Ballsbridge born, Blackrock resident, Maria. Both sides from very leafy surrounds. Danny rather ruined the exclusive element of this momentous announcement by galumphing in with one of his own. Thrilled with himself. Maria was the only woman for him. “She’s a breath of fresh air,” he said, adding his name to her growing list of nominees. Growing, but still shy of the required 20 signatures to get on the ballot paper as the day wore on. She needs those names in the bag by midday on Wednesday to make the cut. Mother-of-five Maria, who homeschools her children, is a skilled television performer. Extremely conservative on social matters, she rose to national prominence during the referendums on marriage equality and repealing the Eighth amendment on abortion with her uncompromising opposition to both measures. She was on the winning side, though, during last year’s referendums on family and care, when voters rejected the Government’s muddled constitutional questions on expanding the concept of family. The fab four appealed to other Independent TDs and Senators to ‘facilitate democracy’ and get Maria over the line She certainly charmed Independent Ireland during their meeting on Monday night. Cork North-Central TD Ken O’Flynn, who married his husband Francisco in Seville in 2022, said he was supporting Maria’s bid having been assured by her that she would work with the LGBTQ community during her presidency. His colleague Richard O’Donoghue, from Limerick County, told journalists that his son is gay but he was reassured by Maria’s respectful responses during their meeting. Independent Ireland put out a statement explaining the decision in more detail. “We were impressed by her honesty, her candour and her ability to clearly communicate her views and vision for the presidency. We were particularly struck by her determination to be a genuine voice for the people of Ireland who feel ignored and unrepresented by the political establishment.” Backing her would ensure voters “are given a real choice”. The fab four appealed to other Independent TDs and Senators to “facilitate democracy” and get Maria over the line. And they finished with a stupendously ironic last line, declaring she “deserves the opportunity to present her case and the people of Ireland deserve the right to choose”. Not to be confused with a woman’s right to choose, an opportunity which Maria Steen refused to countenance during the referendum on abortion, which was carried by a landslide vote. [ Maria Steen: The Iona Institute barrister hoping to become president of IrelandOpens in new window ] “We are true democrats,” she said outside Leinster House at the start of her charm offensive which was ongoing throughout the day, much of the time with Senator Rónán Mullen by her side. Meanwhile, the work of Independent Ireland carried on. So much to do. So much of it in the public eye. A politician has to look his best during these times. So, from a statement with jaw-dropping last line to a question with an arresting opening line. Heads swivelled when party leader Michael Collins, during the Order of Business in the Dáil, began his question thus: “Independent Ireland met with the Irish Hairdressers Federation today...” It was the natural thing to do. But upon closer inspection, his hair didn’t look any different. But there will be a lot of pressure on hairdressers during the coming weeks of the campaign. Good idea for Michael and the boys to get in there first. But no. Along with giving Maria their blessing, they also wanted to highlight the case of the hairdressing industry which is in a bad way. “There is a stark future for many hair salons if they do not get a VAT reduction to 9 per cent in January. Hair salons employ thousands of people and apprentices in this country. Suppliers are now refusing to credit many of these salons. There is a huge crisis.” Meanwhile, also back in Leinster House following his big nomination announcement, Danny Healy-Rae looked mightily pleased with himself, even sending a beaming smile up to the press gallery in between looking at his mobile phone. Perhaps it was because the old band was back together again, if only for a one-off gig. Once a member of the Roaring Independents, Danny and his brother Michael left to support the Government in return for a sweetheart deal for Kerry. Last week in the Dáil, Danny Healy-Rae suggested autism may be caused by a lack of vitamins Now a Minister of State, Michael Healy-Rae has publicly thrown his support behind Fine Gael’s Heather Humphreys even though he signed Steen’s papers. But one gets the impression that Danny’s declaration is more in tune with the mood of the Healy-Rae organisation. But wait. There might have been another reason for his happy demeanour. While the Indyeyes were communing with Maria on Monday night, Donald Trump was over in Washington about to make bizarre and unproven statements connecting autism to pregnant women taking paracetamol. Last week in the Dáil, Danny Healy-Rae suggested autism may be caused by a lack of vitamins. His comment was widely condemned. Maybe he has a direct line to US health secretary Robert F Kennedy jnr, who was standing behind the US president when he made his comments, which have also been widely condemned. Meanwhile, Maria continued on her hunt for those elusive final nominations. Along the trail were some who might have been expected to lend support. Among them, Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell. But by teatime, having met the very charming and persuasive prospective candidate – “a very fine lady” – he thought long and hard and resisted her blandishments for the sake of Ireland. Senator Craughwell was not for turning. Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day. Every Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday when the Dáil sits © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Integrated As an Off-Ramp For BlackRock And VanEck Tokenized Funds

Ripple, an enterprise-focused blockchain service closely tied to the XRP Ledger, said on Tuesday that its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has been added to Securitize’s platform, enabling users to exchange shares in tokenized money market funds by major crypto investment firms BlackRock and VanEck for the U.S. dollar-pegged token. Ripple and Securitize debuted a smart contract allowing holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s Treasury Fund (VBILL) to swap their tokenized shares for the RLUSD. The smart contract enables BUIDL and VBILL investors to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD at any time, facilitating additional on-chain transactions. “Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo stated. The move comes as Securitize seeks to expand the functionality of the XRP Ledger, according to the press release. This marks the first integration of RLUSD into Securitize’s offerings, with “additional use cases and assets planned.” Ripple rolled out the RLUSD stablecoin on the XRPL and Ethereum blockchains in December 2024. While it’s much smaller than Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, RLUSD has grown to a market cap of nearly $740 million within the past year, becoming the eighth-largest stablecoin in the industry. Ripple’s senior VP of stablecoins, Jack McDonald, described the integration in Securitize’s platform as a “natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” adding: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Company Charter, and has been greenlighted by some global authorities for asset tokenization. In June, the Dubai Financial Services Authority approved RLUSD support in the Dubai Land Department’s real estate tokenization initiative. Additionally, Singapore’s DBS Bank last week unveiled a collaboration with $1.6 trillion financial giant Franklin Templeton and Ripple to offer new trading and lending solutions using tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin. The integration of RLUSD for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds comes as total tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Securitize surpass $4 billion.

The valuation would cast the issuer of USDT, the world's largest stablecoin, into the ranks of artificial intelligence developer OpenAI and Elon Musk's space transport company SpaceX, which received similar valuations. El Salvador-based Tether is aiming to raise $15-$20 billion for an approximate 3% stake, Bloomberg reported, although an additional source said that the range was a goal and could be much lower. The sources said discussions were in the initial stages and that the deal could change. The announcement is the latest evidence of the rising significance of stablecoins, a result of the friendlier political and regulatory environment in the U.S. under the Trump administration, including the Genius Act greenlighting the issuance and trading of stablecoins. During a White House visit in July shortly before the passage of the legislation, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, told Decrypt of the firm's plans to create USAT, a U.S.-specific stablecoin catering to different use cases than USDT, the company’s flagship stablecoin. In September, the company named Bo Hines, former executive director of the White House’s digital assets working group, to serve as USAT's CEO. Earlier in the summer, stablecoin rival Circle listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's debut outpaced those of tech behemoths Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb, nearly quadrupling its initial offer price of $31. The company currently has a valuation above $30 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data. Tether has a market cap of $172 billion, more than double Circle's $74 billion value, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. On Tuesday at a conference in Seoul, Hines said during an interview that Tether has no plans to raise money, Bloomberg reported. The deal would involve new shares, not current investors selling their equity. Investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald is serving as the lead adviser. In recent weeks, potential investors have received access to a data room as they consider their participation, the publication reported, which added that a deal is expected to close by year's end. According to its own attestation in July, Tether issued $20 billion in USDT through the first six months of the year and generated a net profit of $5.7 billion over this period, including $4.9 billion in its second quarter alone. The firm counts Bitcoin and gold among its holdings.

Ripple has joined forces with Securitize on a smart contract that allows holders of BlackRock and VanEck tokenised funds to exchange their shares to Ripple for the firm's stablecoin. 0 24 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. By bringing Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin to Securitize's tokenisation platform, the smart contract adds an additional off ramp for BlackRock's BUIDL and VanEck's VBILL tokenised short term treasury funds. The smart contract means that BUIDL and VBILL holders can instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD 24/7, unlocking additional stable, on-chain transfers. Investors gain continuous exposure to RLUSD while preserving exposure to on-chain yield and a broader range of DeFi strategies. Jack McDonald, SVP, stablecoins, Ripple, says: "Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenised funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto." Carlos Domingo, CEO, Securitize, adds: "Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenised assets. Together, we’re delivering real-time settlement and programmable liquidity across a new class of compliant, on-chain investment products—bringing the full potential of blockchain to institutional finance."

Title: BlackRock’s $2 billion BUIDL fund may soon expand to XRP Ledger

RLUSD’s rapid growth showcases its potential as a stable exchange tool for institutional tokenized funds like BlackRock's BUIDL. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenization platform Securitize is looking to integrate with the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a step that could bring BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) directly onto the blockchain network, according to a Sept. 23 statement. This impending move signals a deepening link between institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure, while also expanding XRPL’s presence in the real-world asset (RWA) sector. In recent months, XRPL has attracted multiple institutional adopters such as Guggenheim, VERT, and Dubai Land Registry. These additions have pushed the ledger into the top ten blockchains for RWA activity, underlining its growing relevance in capital markets. Ripple has reinforced this momentum by publishing a roadmap that positions XRPL, along with native assets XRP and RLUSD, as infrastructure for stablecoin payments, collateralized lending, and broader institutional use cases. Against this backdrop, the possible arrival of the $2 billion BUIDL fund on XRPL would serve as a milestone, given its status as the industry’s largest tokenized money market fund. As part of the collaboration, Ripple and Securitize are rolling out a smart contract integration that embeds RLUSD into the tokenization platform. The contract will allow investors to exchange shares in tokenized funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL for RLUSD 24/7. The integration is designed to enhance liquidity and offer investors a seamless way to move between tokenized money market funds and on-chain stable assets. While RLUSD for BUIDL is already live, VBILL support is expected to follow shortly. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, said the collaboration highlights RLUSD’s accelerating institutional adoption, noting that: “Last week we announced DBS and Franklin Templeton using $RLUSD as a liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases. This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds.” According to CryptoSlate data, RLUSD is among the fastest-growing stablecoins, now commanding a market capitalization of $741.4 million. Its integration into leading tokenized funds positions it as a core player in the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Why Micron's Record Sales and Strong Outlook Are a Bullish Signal for the AI Trade
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/why-micron-record-sales-and-strong-outlook-are-a-bullish-signal-for-the-ai-trade-11815823
Time Published: 2025-09-23T21:15:17Z
Full Content:
Micron Technology (MU) shares climbed in extended trading Tuesday after the memory chip maker posted record quarterly sales, boosted by surging demand for AI hardware. The Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading. They've nearly doubled in value in 2025 through Tuesday's close. The memory chip maker reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to a record $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. Both figures topped analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha as Micron's data center business grew. As a memory supplier for leading artificial intelligence chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron stands to benefit from the same trends and its results can be taken as a positive sign for the AI trade. “In fiscal 2025, we achieved all-time highs across our data center business and are entering fiscal 2026 with strong momentum and our most competitive portfolio to date. As the only U.S.-based memory manufacturer, Micron is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead," said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Looking ahead, Micron said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, ahead of consensus projections.

US stock market retreated today after hitting record highs recently, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.53% to around 6,658 and the Nasdaq falling nearly 1% amid a selloff in Nvidia shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dipped 0.19%, closing near 46,293.

Title: Sustainability remains hot topic in corporate America

A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts. Low-carbon energy firm CEO says executives dialed in on climate change, pondering adjustments despite shifts in Washington Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer Joseph Dominguez (right), president and CEO of Constellation, with Nat Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Photos by Veasey Conway/Harvard Staff Photographer The current U.S. administration has de-emphasized many measures aimed at fighting climate change, but that hasn’t affected the conversation around sustainability among many business leaders, according to the chief executive of the nation’s largest provider of low-carbon energy. “We’re dealing with some of the largest clients on the planet. You’ve heard us announce deals with Meta, with Microsoft, and with others. I will tell you the conversation in the room has not changed,” said Joseph Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. Dominguez spoke Friday morning at Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall at the Harvard Climate Symposium, part of Harvard Climate Action Week, which featured an array of climate-change-focused events across the University’s campuses. Dominguez said business executives are well aware of the significant climate shifts that are expected over the coming decades. The last time the climate rose between 6 degrees and 8 degrees Celsius, it took 8,000 years, he said. This time it’s expected by the end of the century, with some models predicting warming to be even higher. “If you’re a businessperson in this space, that’s got to tell you that 10 years from now this is going to be a much more difficult conversation, because not only are politics going to change but the environment — political and otherwise — is going to change,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who the president is. People are looking at business fundamentals and trying to predict the future environments. The bottom line is the president’s going to serve another three years, and then things are going to change again.” The Constellation executive said the current administration has shown some support for selected low-carbon energy sources. The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” cut credits for wind and solar but left them intact for geothermal, advanced nuclear, and battery storage. Dominguez predicted nuclear may be set up for a renaissance. While nuclear power lost support among the public and many politicians in recent decades, Republicans have consistently supported the industry. More recently, he said, some Democrats have softened their stance against nuclear because it is carbon-free. That makes nuclear, while not the first choice on either side of the aisle, the second choice of both. “Nuclear, ironically, after having been ignored for decades and, frankly, despised by some components of the Democratic Party, is now emerging as the consensus view on technology,” Dominguez said. “It’s the only thing that 100 percent of Democrats voted for and 100 percent of Republicans voted for.” The symposium, organized by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, opened with comments from Harvard President Alan Garber and Salata Institute Faculty Director James Stock, Harvard’s vice provost for climate and sustainability. Stock said this is a pivotal moment for climate and energy, with energy demand rising rapidly, in part because of the demand from data centers and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. And despite the current political environment, the rapid growth of low-carbon technology is a reason for optimism. “A key source of hope is the stunning progress on low-carbon energy technologies,” Stock said. “Over the past 15 years, prices on solar power, wind power, and batteries have plummeted,” he said. “EVs are rapidly approaching price parity with internal combustion engines, and, due in part to important work here at Harvard, new methods of detecting methane leaks have improved dramatically so oil and gas companies can sell their natural gas instead of leaking it to the atmosphere.” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said the work at Harvard is just part of her administration’s vision for the state’s future, which is to become a hub of climate technology. Key to that, she said, will be the continued development of jobs in the low-carbon energy sector. Healey has appointed a cabinet-level climate chief to oversee all the pieces needed to make that come about, including workforce development, K-12 education, higher education, transportation, and even housing. “The workforce is not just something that’s nice to have; it’s absolutely essential,” said Healey, who spoke at the Climate Symposium in discussion with Tracy Palandjian, Harvard Corporation fellow and founder of the nonprofit Social Finance. “For all the policy positions and laws passed, none of that does any good unless you’re able to actually implement and operationalize.” Massachusetts needs an estimated 34,000 green-energy workers, Palandjian said, to fill well-paying jobs in the trades that also have the prospect of growth. Palandjian outlined a program started by Social Finance that aims to boost community college graduation rates by providing funds for students to meet the everyday hurdles and expenses — such as transportation and childcare — that often lead them to break off their studies short of graduation. The fund would be repaid by students if they land well-paying jobs or by the students’ employers, on a voluntary basis, and then cycled back to a new generation of students. Healey praised the program, saying that kind of innovation will help a sector she believes remains a big part of the state’s future despite political headwinds. “We’re going to do this. We have to do this. Our economies depend on this,” Healey said. “We just try to put points on the board and keep moving forward as best as we can.” Designation comes as Harvard’s decadeslong archaeological dig uncovers new secrets from remains of ancient Turkish city In podcast, experts discuss why learning to love to read again may be key to reversing trend New data-based study debunks long-held notion, finds wide opportunity gaps remain Geneticist explains recent analyses made possible by tech advances show human history to be one of mixing, movement, displacement 7 min read Yet federal funding cuts have put next chapter of David Reich’s work in doubt 3 min read In Ed School panel, Howard Gardner says tech could make ‘most cognitive aspects of mind’ optional for humans 4 min read A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts.

Title: Amazon contractor Accelore Group to lay off 200-plus workers in North Texas

DALLAS — A contractor for Amazon Logistics plans to lay off more than 200 workers at two facilities in North Texas, according to filings with the state. Accelore Group, which is contracted by Amazon Logistics for package delivery services, plans to cut 214 jobs at two Amazon Logistics facilities -- one in the 3700 block of San Jacinto Drive in Fort Worth and one in the 12800 block of Eastgate Drive in Mesquite -- by Nov. 1, according to a filing with the Texas Workforce Commission. The affected employees are primarily delivery associates, along with four dispatch managers, a fleet supervisor, an operations manager, a hiring manager and a helper, according to the filing. "All affected employees have been notified of their separation dates and that their separation from employment will be permanent," the letter, signed by Accelore Group CEO Akram Syed and filed with the Teas Workforce Commission, stated. An Amazon spokesperson said Accelore Group is exiting Amazon's delivery service partner program in which independent third-party groups, like Accelore Group, provide delivery drivers who deliver packages for Amazon. Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal, which first reported the news of Accelore Group's planned layoffs, report that the program launched in 2018 and seeks to help entrepreneurs start delivery businesses. "Accelore Group is exiting the Amazon Delivery Service Partner program. We're actively working to help connect affected employees with other Delivery Service Partners in the Dallas-Forth Worth region who are currently hiring," Amazon said in a statement. Accelore Group was founded in 2003 in the Dallas area, according to their website. Amazon also ended contracts with two Philadelphia-area delivery partners, leading to nearly 150 jobs being cut, as the Dallas Business Journal reported. Amazon has invested about $70 billion in Texas since 2019 and has 49 fulfillment centers, 33 delivery stations and 36 Whole Foods locations in the state, according to the DBJ. Amazon reportedly recently bought 120 acres of land in Terrell, which is about 30 miles east of Dallas, for "the development of an international distribution center."

Title: Ethereum slides 20% – So why did whales just bet $1B on a rebound?

ETF exits hit Ethereum hard, but whale accumulation hinted at resilience. ETF outflows reached $76 million, with BlackRock selling $15.1 million ETH and market makers repositioning aggressively on Binance. A whale opened a $1 billion long, ETH volume hit $40.5 billion, and analysts flagged chop before a potential Q4 rally. Ethereum [ETH] took the biggest hit in the recent market downturn and slipped closer to $4,000 after a 20% decline from its Q3 high of $4,900, with one week left in the quarter. Institutions have continued to dump their Ethereum holdings, flashing leveraged longs. However, such massive dips before have triggered rallies, with analysts predicting more chop before a rally. On-chain data showed that Binance was among the big institutions dumping Ethereum. According to data from Wimar.X, market makers such as Wintermute and Flow Traders were purchasing millions of ETH from Binance. Additionally, BlackRock sold about $15.1 million in ETH. Meanwhile, total Ethereum ETF outflows surpassed $76 million in 24 hours, led by Fidelity and Bitwise with $55 million combined. Source: Wimar/X That alignment reflected heavy institutional repositioning. In past cycles, similar flush-outs marked reversal points as year-end approached. Even so, what do analysts expect next? When writing, the price of Ethereum was approaching $4,000 from a high of $4,900. The reaction of ETH at the $4,000 level could determine its next trajectory. A dip below could take the price to $3,800 or lower, while a hold could start the rally. Analyst Michael van de Poppe predicted more sideways chop before any recovery, though he doubted ETH would fall as deep as $3,550. Source: Michael van de Poppe He noted that the 20-week MA was getting closer to the price. This indicated that compression was building up, a signal that price was preparing a move. On top of that, he framed the 20% dip as a key accumulation zone—an idea whales seemed to back. In the last 24 hours, a whale opened a 237K ETH long worth roughly $1 billion on Kraken. Spot data reinforced bullish flows. Ethereum’s trading volume hit $40.5 billion, surpassing Bitcoin by $7 billion. Source: Coinalyze Lastly, the price action appeared to be repeating 2017 and 2020 patterns per CoinGlass data. In these years, Ethereum gained in the second, third, and fourth quarters. With a similar pattern in play, ETH could extend its gains into the last quarter of the year.

Title: Fintech Giant Revolut Unveils $13 Billion Bet To Become The First Truly Global Bank
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertolsen-1/2025/09/23/fintech-giant-revolut-unveils-13-billion-bet-to-become-the-first-truly-global-bank/

ByRobert Olsen, Contributor. Revolut is making its biggest push yet on the world stage, pledging £10 billion ($13 billion) to fuel a rapid expansion that aims to reach 100 countries and grow its customer base to 100 million by the end of the decade. Ambition has never been in short supply at Revolut. By the end of the decade, the fintech says it wants to be operating in 100 countries and serving 100 million customers. “We always wanted to be global from day one,” said Nik Storonsky, cofounder and CEO, at the company’s new headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf. “The vision is very simple: we want to be in 100 countries, and with 100 million" customers. That vision has already taken Revolut further than most fintech firms. From its early days, when work was primarily done at a Starbucks in Canary Wharf—before Storonsky and cofounder Vlad Yatsenko decamped to Level39, a co-working space for tech startups—the firm has grown into a financial giant. Today it serves more than 65 million customers in over 50 markets, and it now occupies four floors in the YY London tower. The company’s growth trajectory is just as impressive as its new office. Revolut expects to generate more than £4 billion in revenue this year, having posted a pretax profit of $1.4 billion in 2024—its fourth consecutive year in the black. Investors have taken notice: a secondary share sale now underway values the business at $75 billion, up from $45 billion just a year ago. The firm’s soaring valuation has turned both Storonsky and Yatsenko into billionaires. Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, attended the opening of the firm’s new headquarters on Tuesday and welcomed Revolut’s pledge to invest $4 billion in the U.K. and create 1,000 new jobs over the next five years. She noted that the move adds to a recent wave of investment from financial heavyweights including Blackstone, BlackRock, and PayPal, bringing the U.K.’s tally of fresh commitments to more than £110 billion. Revolut’s ambitions extend well beyond Britain. By mid-2027 it aims to reach 100 million customers, and by 2030 it plans to add more than 30 new markets to its global operations. In Europe, it is launching branches in Portugal and Belgium and preparing to apply for a French banking license. In Asia, it is preparing to launch in India and is seeking further licenses in Australia and New Zealand. The company has already established a global tech hub in the Philippines. The firm also has plans for Africa and the Middle East. Revolut will make its first push into Africa, beginning with South Africa. It will expand in the Middle East with the help of a newly granted in-principle payments license in the United Arab Emirates. Latin America is also in the firm’s sights: the company will open a bank in Mexico early next year before moving into Colombia and Argentina. For Storonsky, all of this fits into a mission that has been consistent since those early days in Canary Wharf. “Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers,” he said. “And our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that.”

Title: Trump administration proposes overhauling H-1B visa process for higher-paid workers

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time After announcing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, the Trump administration on Tuesday proposed overhauling the visa’s lottery selection process to prioritize higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign employees. The proposed policy changes could reignite the debate over the use of foreign labor by U.S. employers. The move comes as President Donald Trump has taken aim at H-1B visas, a program used widely by Big Tech and outsourcing companies to hire foreign workers, announcing Friday that companies would be required to pay a $100,000 fee with new applications submitted after Sept. 21. The administration on Tuesday targeted H-1B visa allocation, proposing a “weighted selection process” for when annual demand for the visas tops the 85,000 limit set by Congress, which it says has happened every year for more than a decade. The new process would replace the current lottery system that determines who gets to apply for those limited visa spots in favor of putting more weight on higher skilled and higher paid foreign workers, according to a proposed rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random. The Trump administration’s proposal would assign prospective employees to four different wage bands, with workers in the highest wage category being entered into the selection pool four times and those in the lowest wage category being entered into the selection pool once. The Department of Homeland Security stated in the proposal that the weighted system would better serve the visa program’s original intent and "incentivize employers to offer higher wages or higher skilled positions to H-1B workers and disincentivize the existing widespread use of the H-1B program to fill lower paid or lower skilled positions.” It said the proposed selection process would still maintain opportunities for employers to hire H-1B workers at “all wage levels.” The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” across health care, tech and finance industries, and other STEM-related fields. The two new proposed policies together send “a strong signal of the direction that the administration wants to go,” said Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, a company that offers services to people navigating the immigration process in the U.S. If adopted, the policies would benefit companies seeking to keep foreigners with specialized skills who studied at American universities in the U.S., as well as ensuring H-1B visas “disproportionately go to people who are deemed higher skilled, represented by higher wages and higher salary,” he said. Trump stated Friday that changes were needed in the visa system, saying it was designed to bring in temporary workers with “additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.” For the last H-1B lottery round, which closed its registration in March, about 339,000 people applied. Of those, 120,141 applications were selected for the lottery, according to USCIS data. The proposal faces a 30-day public comment period before it is considered by the administration for a final rule, a process that could take months. If the changes are adopted, companies seeking to hire lower-wage workers from India and China for computer-related jobs appear likely to be among the most affected. For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research. Start-ups and smaller companies who cannot afford to pay their workers in the higher pay categories compared to major tech companies would also be impacted, Wang said. Deedy Das, a partner at Menlo Ventures venture capital group, said in a social media post that the latest proposal would hurt many tech companies. “Overall, it’s really bad for startups, early employees, helps IT consulting shops and can be easily gamed,“ Das wrote. Trump’s announcement of a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas touched off a frenzy among current visa holders, the companies that employ them and countries around the world as they worked to understand the edict. Eventually, the White House clarified that it would be a one-time fee and apply only to new visa applicants. Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21. That's a steep rise from current fees, which are usually $2,000 to about $5,000. Both the fee and Tuesday's proposal are likely to face challenges in court. A growing chorus on both the left and the right say an over-reliance on the visa by U.S. firms has put U.S.-born workers at a disadvantage. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has called the H-1B visa program a “scam,” while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has claimed that some of the companies most reliant on H-1B visas, such as Amazon and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have also had sizable layoffs, though it did not cite evidence that the use of the visa and the layoffs are related. In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000. Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Daniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education.

Title: Ripple, Securitize Partner to Enable RLUSD Exchange for BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Funds

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Securitize partners with Ripple to enable shareholders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized funds to exchange their shares for RLUSD stablecoin. BlackRock BUIDL and VanEck VBILL tokenized funds shareholders will now be allowed to exchange their shares for Ripple’s RLUSD, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, in a new partnership between Securitize and Ripple. This new feature was announced on September 23 in a press release published on Securitize’s website. Securitize is the company behind BlackRock’s, VanEck’s, and other institutions’ tokenization activities, being a world leader in tokenizing real-world assets with over $4 billion AUM as of May 2025. Initially, the RLUSD exchange will only be available for BlackRock’s BUIDL, with VanEck’s VBILL integration planned for the “coming days.” “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, also commented on the partnership, saying it is “a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets.” The company is also integrating with the XRP Ledger, going beyond a simple RLUSD exchange feature. “Together, we’re delivering real-time settlement and programmable liquidity across a new class of compliant, on-chain investment products—bringing the full potential of blockchain to institutional finance,” Domingo added. BlackRock launched BUIDL in partnership with Securitize on March 20, 2024. The fund offers exposure to qualified investors to US Treasury, cash, and repurchase agreements, currently with over $2 billion AUM among 91 holders, according to data from RWA.xyz. BUIDL is available on seven blockchains: Ethereum ETH $3 948 24h volatility: 3.4% Market cap: $476.35 B Vol. 24h: $63.55 B , Solana SOL $196.2 24h volatility: 5.9% Market cap: $106.74 B Vol. 24h: $12.18 B , Avalanche AVAX $28.29 24h volatility: 12.8% Market cap: $11.98 B Vol. 24h: $1.64 B , Aptos APT $3.96 24h volatility: 5.1% Market cap: $2.79 B Vol. 24h: $643.63 M , Arbitrum ARB $0.41 24h volatility: 2.9% Market cap: $2.23 B Vol. 24h: $542.89 M , Polygon, and Optimism OP $0.65 24h volatility: 4.2% Market cap: $1.16 B Vol. 24h: $208.00 M . The fund distributes income daily, charges a management fee of 0.20-0.50%, and has seen monthly transfer volumes of around $425 million, underscoring its appeal for DeFi integrations and stable yield generation. BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund | Source: RWAxyz Building on this momentum, VanEck entered the tokenized fund space with its Treasury Fund, VBILL, launched on May 13, 2025, also in collaboration with Securitize. As VanEck’s inaugural tokenized offering, VBILL provides blockchain-based access to short-term US Treasuries, targeting qualified investors with a lower entry point of $100,000. VBILL currently has 14 holders and a $74 million AUM, available on four blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Chain BNB $948.0 24h volatility: 6.1% Market cap: $131.94 B Vol. 24h: $3.43 B , Solana, and Avalanche. VanEck Treasury Fund | Source: RWAxyz The recently added liquidity against RLUSD, promised to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, could increase the accessibility and demand for both tokenized products—boosting the market’s interest in these real-world asset tokens. Tokenization has become a popular topic on Wall Street and among institutional investors, with Nasdaq already moving to facilitate tokenized stock trading with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as Coinspeaker reported.

Title: Ripple and Securitize Launch 24/7 Off-Ramp for BlackRock Tokenized Fund

Written byShota Oba Edited byMohammad Shahid Ripple and Securitize announced a smart contract. It lets holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized Treasury funds redeem shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD). The feature creates a regulated off-ramp that works 24/7. It gives institutional investors instant settlement and programmable liquidity. BlackRock launched the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) in March 2024. It surpassed $1 billion in assets within its first year. VanEck introduced the Treasury Fund (VBILL) in May 2025 on Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Solana. Ripple said BUIDL redemptions are live, and VBILL will follow in the coming days. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, said the option to redeem shares for RLUSD is “a natural next step” in bridging traditional finance with crypto. Securitize framed the integration as RLUSD’s first use on its regulated platform. The platform manages more than $4 billion in tokenized assets under SEC oversight. Carlos Domingo, Securitize’s chief executive, said the deal enables “real-time settlement and programmable liquidity” across compliant products. Ripple chose BNY Mellon to hold RLUSD reserves. Issued under a New York Department of Financial Services trust charter, RLUSD is backed one-to-one by cash and Treasurys. Assets stay segregated and subject to attestations. Analysts note that pairing NYDFS oversight with SEC-linked platforms shows the growing overlap—and at times tension—between state and federal rules in the US. Very excited to share that @BlackRock’s $BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s $VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through @Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL.Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.… Brad Garlinghouse said redemptions now run on Ethereum, with XRP Ledger support expected “soon.” Ripple launched RLUSD in late 2024. Since then, the stablecoin has passed $700 million in market capitalization. It also joined Ripple’s cross-border payments network and gained traction in decentralized finance pools. Ripple partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton in Singapore to add RLUSD to asset management. It expanded access in Africa to support remittances and payments. The firm also planned a 2026 launch in Japan with SBI under Financial Services Agency rules.

Today we’ll talk about his path into the cycling world, why he’s sticking with mixed wheel setups and what’s next for his two companies. Thanks for joining me Miles. Miles 0:43Hey. Thanks for having me, sir. Jeff Barber 0:47Well, you you’ve had a pretty colorful and eclectic background before starting mullet cycles. Tell us a little bit about your previous career and how you made the leap into the bike industry. Miles 0:59I did like a mountain bike summer camp, and I was 13 and got altitude sickness, and had a blast, made a bunch of cool friends. Um, I’m from New York, so I was, I went out to Colorado for this camp, and I broke a bunch of stuff on my bike. And was like, I want to work at a bike shop so I can get this kind of stuff. Jeff Barber 1:28Were you living in the city at the time, New York City? Miles 1:31I was actually living just outside the city. So a lot of people don’t know Brooklyn Queens is on Long Island, and then you have Nassau County, Suffolk County, it’s a pretty big island, so I was actually on the island about 10 miles outside of Manhattan. Jeff Barber 1:53And there’s mountain bike trails on Long Island, but it’s not like the first place people think of when they think of mountain biking. Miles 2:01No, they, they definitely don’t. I was most more of escaped skater. You know, I’d wear the Janko jeans, and I would go to the Brooklyn banks and kind of hanging out with bad crowd. One of my friends, older brother, had a mountain bike, and my friend’s parents and my parents spoke, and they’re like, Yeah, you should send them off, you know, get them a mountain bike and send them off to camp. So because I was, I was kind of becoming a bad boy. So, yeah, that’s, I guess, you know, lucky for me for having that friend and having his older brother that that’s kind of like, you know, I was, I didn’t know what a mountain bike was. It that I knew what a BMX bike was so but yeah, there were trails out in Long Island. My first time mountain biking ever was in Colorado, in Silverton on this camp. So before that, it was like, at this, you know, small walking park behind my neighborhood. So I really didn’t even know what mountain bike it was until I got out there. When I got out there, I was like, Oh, my God. Jeff Barber 3:19Like, there’s mountains in mountain biking, Miles 3:22Yeah, exactly I was, you know, and that’s why I got altitude sickness, because I was at sea level my entire life, you know, and I didn’t want to be at the back of the pack, so I was just really pushing myself hard. So I ended up working at this bike shop called Bike Works in Greenville, Long Island and small bike shop, and he wouldn’t pay me because I was like, 13, but I was like, I’ll just work for parts. I’ll clean the shop. I just want to learn everything about bikes, how to work on my bike. And, I mean, kind of like, long story short, on that, and I ended up working there till I was, like 26 even when I started other companies on my own, it was just kind of became like a second dad to me, in a lot of ways, the owner, it would just be me and him in there. So, you know, I would just constantly pick his brain with stuff. And then I ended up kind of running the shop. And then when I started my companies, you know, yeah, I would work there, like on Sundays, just as a bit of therapy. So I really working at the shop. I never wanted to get into the bike industry. I just, I saw how competitive it was, plus we carried specialized in track, which is really rare. Um, he kind of got, like, grandfather, yeah. 90s. He opened up, I want to say, like in the late 70s, okay, early 80s. So he got those brands, like when they were, you know, kind of starting out. And, yeah, it was just there. There was so much good stuff out there, and it was just so competitive. And I just was like, well, you really can’t make money in this industry. Jeff Barber 5:27And, yeah, and so I know a little bit about your story. I mean, yeah, kind of fast forward through. And you know, you worked in jewelry design, you had some of your own companies. So how did you get like, back? Like, what brought you back to say, You know what, I’m gonna, like, start a bike company. How did, how did Mullet Cycles officially get its start? Miles 5:52Well, it again. It was kind of organic. While I was working at that shop, I had started a personal lubricant company, which, you know, ended up being very successful, and we had a customer come into the shop and asked, if you know her, that I made that product, and wanted to pick my brain about it, just like I got a product that I would like to make with you and that I had a bunch of kind of time on my hands because I had, like, a warehouse distributor, it was all pretty just up and up and running. I got into some major retailers such as CVS, with it. So what he had was he was on, like a race, a road bike race team, and they all use Ziploc bags in their bicycle jersey. And he was like, we should make a neoprene bag that has a bunch of compartments to hold all your tools, and we can stick that in our bike jersey. I was a mountain biker. Road biking was pretty dangerous in the metropolitan area. I would sometimes, yeah, you know, people a wife, a widow, would bring in a bike that I had worked on. So, you know, my husband got hit by a car. I don’t know what. I don’t want to see this anymore, you know, part it out and sell the parts, or whatever you want to do with it, you know, after, like, insurance and everything. So I wasn’t that into it, but he was a really cool guy. He actually worked for Blackstone or Blackrock at one of the big investment companies, BlackRock, yeah, one of the big Yep, he actually did their software and stuff for, I guess, trading. He tried to explain it to me that that my brain doesn’t work like that, but he was a really cool guy, like, you just look cool, and he had a swagger. And I was like, Yeah, you know, like, I wanted to pick his brain. And anyway, ended up making that. And, you know, I just kind of made it to make it. It was like a fun little project. I learned he before he started that he was doing clothes, so he knew how to sew. And so I would go over to his flat in Brooklyn and taught me how to sew, and I got materials in the garment district in Manhattan. And it was kind of like, you know, it was like this little side project that was just fun for me. I kind of got sick of New York. I moved to Asheville and Tyler Benedict, a bike groomer, did a review on this sticky pod, which I don’t know how he got his hands on one, because we’re just selling them through the bike shop. Jeff Barber 9:02No PR person reaching out. Miles 9:06No. And I we had, like, oh, he built a website, like a one page website, and, you know, I would maybe send out, like, five a month, uh, mostly in the northeast area. And so I opened up my paypal and it was just like, Dude, there’s like 15k in there, like overnight. And after just having like a few 100 in the sticky pod PayPal, and I was like, Holy crap, my my website got hacked or something. I ended up googling it was on bike. Rumor opened up my inbox so that there were like distributors in there that wanted to carry it, and all this stuff. At that point, I had sold my lubricant company, um. Um, so I was like, Okay, I’ll start making this stuff, you know, okay, I’ll and I had distributors asking me, what other products you make. So I started just developing a product line of products that I wanted but nobody else is making. So, like, I made the grips for brake levers. I made a shock stiction lube. I made, like, this bottle pod, which was an organizer for, like, it was just basically a bottle that had compartments in there, and you could put in your water bottle cage, because, again, my jersey. So I really didn’t use a sticky pod, like, I would just use it as, like a little thing in my car for stuff. Jeff Barber 10:46So a pencil case. Miles 10:48Right, a yellow pencil case. After Asheville, I moved to Colorado. I just wanted bigger mountains, and I always had a love for Colorado. After riding there, when I was in my ute, I would do that summer camp, like every year. So I ended up being like a counselor on that on that camp. And so I had experience all over the West Coast and like my teenage years, which is great. Okay, yeah, so when I moved to Colorado, I visited a bunch of bike shops and asked, you know, told them, hey, I’m in Colorado. These are some of my products. If you’d like, you can get them through like BTi, JBI, and it was also a way to make some new friends in the area. You know, some of the, some of the mechanics I want some riding buddies. One of the shops, Timberline cycles was a foes dealer, and I was my personal bike was a foes and I’d always been a big foes fan. And a foes dealer is really rare. So I wanted to, you know, talk to him about bikes and show him my stuff. He was closing his shop. I kept leaving voicemails. He ended up finally calling me back, and he was like, hey, you know, I’m closing up the shop, and, you know, I got your voicemails, you know, yeah, if you’d like to come in and talk about bikes, you know, sure, so we scheduled a day, got into talking, and he basically was, had dropped off his friends. He was the he basically came to Brent with this idea of a mixed wheel bike, Jeff Barber 12:45And who was the who was the owner of the shop? What was his name? Miles 12:48Mike Vidovich, okay, and he, before he opened that shop, he it was a dirt bike shop. So he carried Gas, gas. And before that, he managed one of the biggest bike shops in the springs, pro pro cycling. Jeff Barber 13:14Yeah. Miles 13:15So yeah, he ended up opening up a dirt bike shop Spain kind of had their recession after hours. This is like 2012 so he couldn’t get dirt bikes anymore. And his employees are like, Why don’t you just carry mountain bikes? Since you know mountain bikes very well, you have a Racetech suspension degree. You were the, you know, you would rebuild the shocks at your shop. And he was a great mechanic, and so he carried a bunch of different brands that had, like, all different suspension designs, basically. So he carried single pivot or DW. When he got the 275 wheel, which was like two or ended 2012 he still had some dirt bikes in his shop. And he was like, hmm, you know, this is kind of like the golden ratio. He had, like, he carried, like Ventana, and they had a 69 ER, so they had a 29 front 26 reader as well as Moots did as well. And he felt that the ratio was just too big a part. And he thought, like the 275 was kind of like the Goldilocks. So he started throwing those wheels on his 29 inch wheel bikes that he sold. And was like, well, and he had some really fast riders. He had one guy, Tucker, who won state championships downhill. He was like, well, there, I need to do things to the geometry in order to really get this correct. And so he contacted a couple of companies that he was carrying and say, Hey, would you be cool? Of maybe making a mixed real bike. And they all said, No, you know, it’s kind of like a fad. It’s been done before. And so he ended up reaching out to foes. Who would you carry? Carried single pivot? And he basically said, if you purchase like, 25 frames, yeah, I’ll do it for you. Okay, they kind of, you know, so Mike went out to Pasadena, which is where they were located at the time, and, you know, stayed with Brent and told him what he wanted. Worked it worked at the shop with him. Told him the geometry and stuff like that. Help pay. You know, Mike had to pay for, like the marketing. So he did a video, paid half the booth for inner bike in 2015 which is when they released it. And I was actually, I had a booth at that show under the miles of my my little trinkets product. So I had actually met like at that show, because I want to go to the foe’s booth. So the new mixer model, and I was like, to me, it just looked really ugly. And I had experience on the big hit back in the day when I used to race in the Norbu series, and they would come through ski platichill in New York, and I got hurt really bad on that, and the 24 inch wheel just had no right being on a downfall course, I Guess, got hung up and, like, launched like Superman, couple a couple of feet, and then boom, and I was concussed and broke a bunch of stuff. So anyway, so getting back to, you know, my kind of telling me, and now, and I told him that, he was like, Well, have you ever, you know, ridden one of these, you know, I know you’re a fan of this brand. And I was like, No. He was like, Well, why don’t you take one out and ride one? So he set one up for me, and I that day, I The shop was really close to Red Rock open space, so I just pedaled from the shop to the trails. And he told me to put my Strava on. And I really didn’t take it serious. I was just kind of riding the bike, and I ended up, Ko, I made, like, two sections, and, oh, wow, without really even trying. And I was like, This doesn’t make sense. And I ended up. So I went back to the shop and, like, I PR at every, every, every segment. I went back to the shop, and I was like, you know, something doesn’t make sense here. Can I take out again? And he was like, Sure. So I took it on section 16, which is more of an enduro trail, and I PR my climbing Kom, another segment, and my PRs were so much faster. And he’s like, you know, and I and he, when I went back to the shop again, I was like, Yeah, this is fast, man. It’s actually better. And he was just laughing. And he’s like, I told you, I told you, it’s the future. And I was like, How come nobody else is doing this? And he said, Well, you know, I called some companies, asked him to make them. They said it was gimmicky, and they’re also banned to race on. You can’t race on these on a mixed wheel bike. Jeff Barber 18:39Okay, yeah. Miles 18:41So you know, was like, Well, why don’t we make it basically, you, you know, understand the geometry. No one’s really doing this. You have Foes. And then I did some research. You had foes and you had light bill. It’s German company. They were the only two that offered them. And, you know, I was like, both of these bikes are pretty ugly. It just my opinion. Eye of the beholder. I was like, let’s make them. Jeff Barber 19:16Because Foes was, Foes was, like, a pretty small brand. Miles 19:19Back then. Yeah, still, still, you know, pretty small, yeah. Jeff Barber 19:24And they were making the bikes. Were they making them in the US? They were like, yeah. And as I recall, they were, they looked pretty, like basic, kind of, like, garage build, yes, Miles 19:34Yeah, yeah. You know, they have always kind of, like, some like, when I would ride it, they would, I would get made fun of. They’re like, You look like a photo riding that thing, yeah? And I would just be like, well, you know, made in the USA, and I don’t need, I just need a single pivot, you know, you need all these linkages, yeah? And you’re not even as fast as me, so, ah. But, yeah, you know, like, I didn’t want to get what he had made with with foes, and I didn’t want to get the light bill because that bike was just It looked very unsafe. And so yeah, look, no one’s doing this. Let’s, let’s do it. I think I could, you know, I think I could figure out how to get a maid and and I also wanted to help him, you know, I felt kind of bad after hearing his story. I’m a bit of an empath, so I get happy from other people’s happiness. And, yeah, he was like, All right, so we’re going to meet every day, and we’re going to develop a business plan, and it’s going to be like a marriage. And so my creative side just instantly, like, I’ll never forget, like, our first launch the next day was I had, like, a list of names. And he was like, you know, we got a lot of steps before we’re thinking of names. And I was like, Yeah, but, you know, I want to call it something and and that gets to the name Mullen, which obviously has become a very popular name to identify a mixed wheel bike. When I, when I had come up with the name, obviously. Well, Mike hated the name. I had made some friends in the industry, like Clint Spiegel, owner of I nine. He their shop was like a mile down the road when I was living in Asheville, and he wanted to meet me hear about my adult escapade. It’s funny, a lot of people always just want to hear about that. That’s like, always very interesting. Jeff Barber 22:14Yeah, yeah. Miles 22:19So I texted him, and was like, Oh, what do you think of this name? And Clint was like, I hate it, you know, it’s trashy. I was, you know, I asked him. I’m like, Well, I asked some of the guys at, you know that, at the shop that worked there, and and I asked Tyler Benedict, the owner of Bike groomer. And, you know, I had reached out to him after he did the sticky pot, and I was like, Hey, thanks, man, and yeah, and he loved it. He thought it was great. So I convinced Mike. I was like, Yeah, this is going to be the name, trust me, it’s great. It’s catchy, and, like, there needs to be, like, a funky name, and, you know, for a bike company, because a lot of the names just have always been so generic, or you didn’t know what it was, you know, I don’t want to mention names, but yeah, yeah. Jeff Barber 23:21And, I mean, it’s kind of like, it’s like, Niner, right? Like, Niner, like, you knew what they were doing, I mean, until they stopped just making 29ers. Miles 23:30Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it was pretty edgy, you know, because everyone would just automatically think of the hair, you know. And just like, right? Some, you know, like burly dudes that just don’t give a f, you know. So, and then obviously, you know, people would ask me, Why are you calling it mullet? And I would tell them, this is in the front party in the back. And they would, you know, and they would laugh, it’s hilarious. So I did some research, making sure that the name wasn’t in use at all. You know, all the URLs were available, mulletbike, DotCom, walletcycles, DotCom, mullet bicycle, DotCom, so I bought all of them and made sure that no one had a trademark on it. And what I found was trek actually had the trademark on Mullet. Jeff Barber 24:32Trek had a bike when they did their 96 er, is that what their bike was? Well, 69 or always get it mixed up. Miles 24:39Yes, 69er, and this is where it gets, kind of like, Huh? They had, they owned Gary Fisher, and Gary Fisher had a 26er called the mullet. And that the Gary Fisher Mullet. It was like a. I don’t know what it was. I guess it was like a jump, jump 26 inch bike, because mullet is also a fish as well. And Gary Fisher would a lot of time use fish for, you know, he kind of like had a fish fetish. But, yeah, Jeff Barber 25:18I thought he was into the Grateful Dead. Miles 25:22That too. He’s into a lot of cool stuff. I mean, let’s be honest, yeah, he’s a very, very eccentric individual. Speaker 1 25:31Yeah. Miles 25:33So Trek had the trademark on Mllet, but they didn’t use it when they came out with their 69er, they just called it a 69 which was a 29 front, 26 rear. They didn’t use that trademark. Jeff Barber 25:49Good name too. I mean, depending, it’s a little little on the nose, but, Miles 25:53Yeah, yeah, a little edgy, especially for track, yeah. But yeah it was a great way to, you know, let people know that it was a mixed wheel bike, or a Franken bike, as we kind of used to call them, like when I had my big hit. We called it a Franken bike because they took a they had a big hit, a 26 or big hit, and then they had the 24 26 big hit, which, so we would call that a 46er, okay, or, or Franken bike. So, yeah, it was, it was, you know, surprising to me. I mean, not really, but I guess in hindsight, surprising to me, that Trek didn’t call the 69er a mullet. Since that firm has gained so much traction, and when I would Google search for mullet, the only thing that came up was like a cycle cross coffee club in San Francisco. I guess they call themselves, like the bullet riders. Jeff Barber 27:07And yeah, vaguely related. Miles 27:11And that the rest everything on Google was just about haircuts and stuff. So I was like, Okay, I think this name’s been the table. Jeff Barber 27:20I guess there was a thing I thought I heard too. There was, like a gearing thing, where people called, like, certain type of gearing, a mullet setup or something, but had nothing to do with the wheels, correct? Miles 27:31Yeah, that actually came in quite a bit later, as far as referring it to mullet, okay, and SRAM was the one that was doing that. They started doing that like in 2019, 2020, after like, after mullet, all of a sudden became a thing of business in the front party, like, let’s mix everything together. And I actually reached out, yeah, everything’s a mullet now, so I reached out to SRAM and said, hey, you know, I have a trademark on mullet. Can you, you know, maybe not call it a mullet. So now they call it the adventure build or something. I’m bigger. They could have come up with something more creative than that, but, yeah, but yeah, so that’s the thing now, yes. Jeff Barber 28:23And so, right? So you you were able to get this trademark, yeah? And obviously, it’s the name of of your business. And you want to make it clear that, yeah, when somebody’s saying a mullet bike, like, you know, they could be confused. Are you talking about Mullet the brand? Are you using it in this other way? And so, yeah, do you think that’s like, has that made it tougher for you, or has it helped you? Like, what do you? What do you? Kind of the strategy behind it now, right, right. Miles 28:51I mean, when it was happening, like, basically the UCI changed their rules to allow mixed wheels for the 2019, season. And so a lot of media groups made, you know, it was a pretty big deal, and they first started calling it mismatched. Number of people, obviously, you know, they’re like, it’s the return of the Franken bike. Okay, yeah. And then, you know, couple comments was like, oh, it’s the mullet. And everyone loved that, because it’s, it’s cool, it’s catchy, yeah, for sure. When that happened, I was obviously spoke to a couple people. You know, what should I do here? I would say it was like 8020 80% of them were like, Oh, it’s great for you. You should, you know, totally run with it. It’s going to bring more eyes onto you, because you’re the original mullet. I mean, we were out for sorry, i. We’re out for like, a couple of years already, to that point, like, we had started in 2017 so, you know. And I had the URL so people like, you know, when they’re Googling it, you’re gonna pop up and then, you know, I had us right. Really, really, just two people. They’re like, you know, you should probably change it. I had done a lot of work, invested a decent amount of money, you know, on the trademark, designing the head badges, getting them casted by my jeweler, the font, building the website. And I was like, Ah, he and I was like, that’s, that’s what this is, you know? I was like, this is, this is a mullet. This is, yeah, this is my bike. So, you know, sometimes it’s something I do battle with. I, you know, companies started calling the mullet, and I’d have to reach out, you know, just to try to protect my brand as best as I could without suing everybody, because I didn’t want to sue everybody I, you know, again, we carried specialized and that was kind of specialized tactic. And I always thought that that was, you know, dirty. It just wasn’t a good way to grow the bike industry, you know, like with enduro, for instance, and the Specialized Enduro. Jeff Barber 31:30And the Roubaix. There’s a lot of examples, right? Miles 31:33Yeah, yeah. And they were going after, like, bike shops and stuff. And, you know, enduro became, like a whole sect of discipline and riding, so I didn’t want to do that. So I just, you know, it’s all bike companies. You know, you probably don’t know I exist. I’m small, but, you know, have this trademark. Can you please not call it that? So they called it MX, which is why you see a lot of companies called MX. So that’s kind of Yeah, you know, I I didn’t make these bikes to sell a ton, to make friends, to be cool. I just made them because I wanted a better bike for myself. And there were certain things on the bike that I wanted, such as three, oh, tires I like a really big chain ring. I was like a runner back in high school, and I didn’t want to be able to run faster than I can pedal. And yeah, with a 38 two chainring and a 52 cassette, I’d be able to climb anything. And then when it came to descending, I’d be pedaling past people, and they’re in their tuck, you know, if we’re on the fire road, or if I’m on like, a long, descending single track, I can still keep my speed up without just pedaling out. And yeah, people weren’t offering that. So, yeah. Jeff Barber 33:09So talk about what makes a Mullet Cycles bike different from other mixed wheel bikes. You know, obviously when you first started out, there weren’t a lot of choices. I mean, sounds like there were two, maybe, yeah, now seems like everybody’s got a mixed wheel bike. So what? What makes mullet cycles bike different from from all the other ones that are on the market? Miles 33:30So this kind of, I would say, the geometry, the geometry is, is the big deal with it, which is why I don’t publish it. When we were building out prototypes, I still had, like, a vision of certain numbers. I was like, and I, I need the head angle to be this. I need, I need the bottom bracket to be here. And Mike was pretty adamant. He was like, Look, if you want to make a bunch of prototypes, go ahead and time test them and you know, see, see what’s going to be the best. So I made, like, over a dozen prototypes, ranging from like head angles, from 62 like all the way up to 68 different bottom bracket heights, different seat angles, different chain stay lengths. And over the course of almost a year, I would ride like sometimes three times a day on section 16, which in that trail in the springs, kind of has everything they have dumbed it down. It’s not as chunky as it used to be, but had really steep switchbacks. Jeff Barber 34:53 I remember riding it when I lived there for sure. Miles 34:57Oh, okay, so yes, you’re familiar with. It, yeah, that’s, I felt like that was a great proving ground. Jeff Barber 35:05Sad that they dumbed it down. It was definitely a challenging trail. Miles 35:09Yeah, a lot of people got hurt. So, you know, what are you gonna do? I guess the town just didn’t want to get sued, or, who knows. So when I was time testing and everything like there was. I remember one prototype that just felt really fast, but it just wasn’t the fastest on Strava. And one particular was consistently the fastest on climbing and descending. And again. Long story short, this was the this was, this was the geometry. And it wasn’t what, at that time, modern geometry, you know, you had long, low, Slack it. It didn’t follow those guidelines at all. And, you know, the difference between a bike from the 90s versus one today is geometry you can put, like great suspension, great brakes on a bike from the late 90s, it’s still going to feel very unstable and ultimately slow. So like, yeah, you know, dirt bikes get their speed out of motors. We kind of get our speed out of geometry, like a modern hardtail with modern geometry symmetrical wheel or safety bike will be faster than a downhaul bike from the late 90s, and what’s his name, did a test. Kyle Warner did a YouTube video on that with his Niner hardtail versus like a retro downhill bike, and the hardtail ended up being faster. So with mixed wheels, I do, you know, there were things that you’re able to do that you couldn’t really get away with on a symmetrical wheel bike, or 29 or 275 or platform, and you know, it’s still something I kind of struggle with, because I would love to share the geometry, but at the same time, people would see the geometry and probably say, I can’t that. I can’t ride that on my trails. It’s, you know, I’ll get hurt. Jeff Barber 37:40Yeah. Yeah. I mean, is it like, I know you won’t, you won’t share the numbers, but yeah, I guess you’re saying it would be surprising to people, or shocking, or they’d be like, Whoa, that number is ridiculously high or ridiculously low. That couldn’t possibly work. Miles 37:55Okay, yes, yes, because I, have, you know, told some of my friends, and they’re like, that makes no sense, you know, like, after they ride the bike, and they’re like, Okay, yeah, it’s fast, oh yeah, you know, they open up their Strava and they got a bunch of PRs, and they’re like, Okay, please tell me. And I tell them, they’re like, that doesn’t make sense. So, you know, released into Geometry, people would look at me and be like, they don’t know what they’re doing. And then specialized, or one of these big box brands would do it, and then it would be okay, you know, kind of like, you know, specialized in Loic Bruni, you know, he was one of the first Jeff Barber 38:47You still haven’t seen, still haven’t seen those numbers from anybody that get close? Miles 38:53They’re still pretty far away. And now, okay, new trends have come with really steep seed angles, and now they’re going longer. Chain stays like the industry is always evolving geometry, and I firmly believe it will continue to evolve. It’s a great way for companies to sell you a new bike every year. It’s marketing, and marketing is a hell of a drug. And you get really fast riders that can be fast on anything, and they’re fast on this quote, unquote, newer geometry. And then everyone’s like, Oh, that’s what I need. So it’s like, I get it like, you know, like people want to know the geometry, and real writers want to know I totally understand, because I’m a real writer, and I don’t know if I. Would trust a company that wouldn’t release their geometry, because that’s just generally how you get a good idea of how the bike’s going to perform and behave on certain trails. So I you know it’s kind of like proprietary information. If you look at dirt bikes, which is a great example, most of them don’t release their geometry, and most of dirt bikes, their geometry hasn’t changed since the 90s. They took a lot of like the 70s and 80s, figuring out different wheel diameters and different geometry, and then they got, you know, 90s came, and they basically optimized it, and it really hasn’t altered off of that platform Since to this day. So that’s kind of like, and obviously they’re using mixed wheels as well. So I kind of, you know, look at it at that perspective, like it’s proprietary. It’s the blueprints of this bike. If I were to publish them, I would get, you know, there’s, like, a lot of these steel garage welders kind of thing, and they would do it and say, Holy smokes. And, you know, I don’t know, it’s like, Well, I came up with that. Jeff Barber 41:38So, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, it sets you apart for sure, and it’s the secret sauce, and it’s a little bit different, a little bit of mystery. And I’m sure people appreciate that. Maybe beyond the bikes, the designs that you know, the geometry, the technical secret sauce, the thing that strikes me when I look at mullet cycles, bikes, and like the one that I tested is they’re just, they’re beautiful bikes, the frame, the finishes, and then the build as well. And I know that you’ve worked exactly designer in the past, and so I’m curious, does that experience kind of carry over into your bike builds? Like, are you looking at these as if they’re like, a piece of jewelry? Miles 42:24I am a red blooded male. Like, I it’s, it’s got to look hot, if it’s not hot. Like, or, you know, I mean, the bikes, you know, when I go out on trails, a lot of people because they just don’t know the brand. I really don’t do a lot of advertising or marketing. It’s just, I just made the bikes. And if you want it, here you go. You want something that’s cool and fast and, you know, kind of reliable. This is it. But, yeah, I always had like an eye for things like, even when I had my foes, they would always be tricked out in such a way that, I mean, you know, they would look cool like I would, you know, my friends would make fun of me for it, because they could. But when I would go out, people be like, Oh, wow, that thing looks cool like I had my foes FXR at my booth in 2015 Interbike, and it was a real eye catcher, and people were coming up to it. I had, like, white wall tires and stuff, and a lot of purple, and it looked like a beach cruiser, but, yeah, cool. So, yeah, I made so many drawings of our bikes, like I have a book of probably 500 I mean, a lot of all different lines, and yet it had to be esthetically pleasing. Wow. And coincide, you know, with the geometry, and same with the single pivot, like single pivot generally look pretty old school, very basic. So trying to make, and then we used an elevated chain stay as well. So trying to make that look, in my opinion, and some people might think it’s ugly and it’s totally fine, in for me, it’s just a very, Jeff Barber 44:39Very good looking, yeah, it’s a challenge to make look cool. Miles 44:44Yeah, you need functional cool. And the elevated chainsack, I really didn’t want to do that was really like, Mike’s thing. And he explained to me, he’s like, look you. You want the big top. Tire. You want the big chain ring. The only way we’re going to be able to do this is if we do an elevated chainstack. And he was like, just make it look cool. He was like, that, you know, okay, you know, you worked as a wax model maker. You should be able to to make it look like art. And in my opinion, that I think they do. I think they look like jewelry. They’re gorgeous bikes in person. There’s so much, dare I say, prettier, Jeff Barber 45:35Yeah, lots of details that you don’t necessarily get from the photos. So one thing I noticed is you don’t offer any carbon fiber bikes, all aluminum, though you did also you’re bringing back a titanium version of the honeymaker. So yeah, why not carbon? Why? Why do you stick with metal bikes? Miles 45:55That’s a good question. I’ve always had bad experiences with carbon, I would just break them after I didn’t have a carbon bike for like, longer than, let’s say, five months before it would fail on me. So, oh geez, it was, it was definitely a topic with my manufacturer because of the lines that I wanted to do. I, you know, showed them my drawings of the tubes, and I was, I was wanted to do hydroforming, and they said, you know, it would be a lot less expensive if you went the carbon fiber route. Carbon fiber frames are actually really surprisingly inexpensive to manufacture, quite a bit less than my aluminum frames. It might come surprising to people. I do believe that might be why a lot of bike manufacturers are able to offer a lifetime warranty, because there’s they’re pretty inexpensive to make, but it’s carbon fiber. So people think, well, I should be spending a lot of money on this. I I believe that carbon is great for pavement. It’s really stiff, really light. And you know you want. You want something really stiff, that that gets all your power down, and for a full suspension, you want something right, that’s laterally stiff, so that rear triangle is just going on a vertical path, so it’s just it, it’s easier on the bearings, easier on the shock, and the bike will feel more plush than if that rear end is flexing. But again, I just, I had really bad experiences with it. A lot of the times I would break them, if I would crash the bike, would just kind of, I would walk back to the bike, and then I would, you know, I would inspect it, and I would see a hole in it because it hit a rock. Miles 48:06So for me, it, I liked aluminum. I mean, there’s obviously steel as well, which is another fabulous metal. It’s very strong. Obviously they make bridges out of it for full suspension. I I, I admire the power, or the strength to weight ratio that aluminum provides. It’s and when I’m climbing, I having something lighter, it’s just going to get me up the hill faster. So, right, yep, aluminum, I just felt was going to be the best material, at least for a full suspension bike. For the hardtail, we could have done steel. Our frames would have been a lot less expensive because it’s such an inexpensive material, and it’s also far easier to weld than aluminum. But again, I love speed. I kind of like a speed. All I want to do is just go fast. So having an aluminum frame, even a hardtail frame, was just going to be faster than a steel frame. And what’s great about steel is it is very compliant. So it does like to stretch and bend and flex. It likes it. That’s why like bridges again made of steel, so the bridge can flex train rails, steel. If you ever watch a train going over the rails, you can see the the wheels flexing the steel. Titanium offers a lot. Lot of similarities to steel with that compliance, but it kind of has like all the good, none of the bad, obviously, other than the price, it’s still pretty easy to well, but the material is far more expensive. However, it’s far lighter and it won’t rust or corrode. So all the bikes that I make I ride, yeah, right, it’s just an advantage. And I just all the bikes I ride, I just want to go fast. So, you know, would I sell more if I would make him in steel, probably, you know, steel is real. Is a great marketing term, but I wouldn’t be going as fast. Jeff Barber 50:52Well, speaking of going fast, your website teases a mixed wheel gravel slash adventure bike. So I’m curious about that bike. What’s the thinking behind a mullet gravel bike? And where are you kind of in that development process? Miles 51:07I believe that a symmetrical wheel bike. It’s based off the road bike platform mountain bikes being symmetrical. And also, like in the early days, it was basically road bike geometry. It was just using knobby tires. So I don’t, after diving into this mixed wheel hole that I have for almost 10 years, I look at a mixed wheel bike as the dirt bike platform. Your front axle sits higher than career axle, so it’s more difficult to go over the handlebars. And there are things that you can do on a dirt bike platform, as far as geometry that you just can’t do on the road bike platform, symmetrical wheels. Gravel bikes were going off road. You uh, going over the handlebar sucks. And I kind of got into gravel riding because, you know, I just enjoyed it. You can really put in a lot of miles and see certain places that you know, generally you might not see, at least on my mountain bike trails where I was living. So, yeah, I’ve went over the handlebars on a gravel bike a couple times, and I’ve, it’s said I need to make a gravel bike with a larger front wheel where my front axle is higher, because when you are running a larger front wheel, you’re basically lifting up on the handlebars almost an inch off the ground. Even when you’re obviously not, it’s just all the time like that. And when you come up to an obstacle or something that looks a little sketch that’s in the road, you lift up on the handlebars so and sometimes you don’t even see it, if it’s like a pothole, and you just got your head down. So by doing, by by running a larger front wheel, it just made the bike more stable off road. So figuring out the geometry, again, has been nothing short of a lot of work. Again, I made a bunch of prototypes. I’ve been working on it since 2019 so like six years almost, which is nuts, yeah, but it like it had to be perfect, and it had to be better. I just didn’t want to make a mixed wheel gravel bike and say, Oh, here’s the mixed wheel gravel bike. You should buy it like, because I ride it and it needed to impress me, and it needed to be faster than what I, you know, my road bike, platform gravel bike, my 700 C from rear it needed to be faster, both on climbing and obviously descending. I couldn’t just take the geometry for my hardtail and copy it. Of course, I made a prototype like that, and it just, it didn’t, just didn’t feel right, and I wasn’t fitted on the bike properly with the drop bar. So finally, and it, it’s somewhat funny, like I Strava testing on gravel is a lot more. The segments are longer. And some days you feel good, you know, on a 4050, mile ride, some days you don’t, and it takes a lot of time. So comparing times, it was difficult. When I finally i. Figured out the geometry I was living in Alabama, and my dealer southern carnage, and I forgot what it’s like a small town in Alabama, but he’s such a cool bike shop. He’s a bit of an OG down owner as well. He did group gravel rides once a week, and he would have, like, groups of 3020, people. And he’s, he’s turned into a fairly big gravel rider, and we’re the same height. So I dropped off this final prototype to him, and I told him, tell me what’s wrong with it. I was I told him, I don’t care which What does. What it does good, I need to know what it does bad. And because I couldn’t find anything anymore, I was like, I think this is it. And I almost wanted to make another prototype so that Thursday, so it’s Friday. I called him because I didn’t hear from him, and I was like, So what’s wrong with it? And he goes, Well, sorry, you’re not going to be able to get it back. And I’m like, Oh no. Something go wrong? And he said, No, I’m keeping it. You’re not getting this back. Let me know how much you want. And I started laughing. I was like, so it’s so, so you like it? And he was like, it is perfect. I this is, you got to make this. I’ve been working on them. I ended up having to make my own fork. So I made my own titanium fork, and in order to coincide with the geometry that was one of the missing pieces of why it was I just couldn’t find a fork, and I couldn’t design the frame around the fork to get just proper stack heights and stuff to make me fit right, and also get the hammer down when I’m pedaling or out of the saddle, and still be stable and easy to turn on like 2030, mile an hour descent. So anyway, yeah, probably in the next couple months I’m going to release it. I’m only making 30 of them, so very limited. I just kind of want it for myself again. And, yeah, if other people want it cool, maybe I’ll make more again, you know, in like a year or so. But it was just, it’s she was so much work, and I’d imagine other companies will probably make a mixed will gravel bike down the line. I don’t see why not. I mean, just even taking a single track off off of a gravel road, you just don’t feel like you’re gonna die, and you’re still able to have fun. And that’s what bikes are about. Jeff Barber 57:58Yeah, that’s a good upgrade, and to fit smaller riders, I would guess too, people are Yeah, in between like a, like a 650 B gravel bike and a regular full size 700 C, yeah, it makes sense. So yeah, in addition to mullet cycles, you run miles wide industries which offers some unique products. We kind of talked about cable buddies, the fork, cork, sticky fingers, brake lever covers, which one of those products, or any of your products, is your your personal favorite? Miles 58:33You know, that’s a really, really hard question. I probably, and this might come as a surprise, I’d probably say the Wet Seal stiction lubricant, Jeff Barber 58:52Okay, yeah. Miles 58:54And it’s, it’s not the same formula as my old company. This actually developed when I was living in Asheville. So back like in 2014 2015 is when I came out with this. And the suspension experts, which was a suspense bike suspension shop in Asheville, they ended up getting purchased by Fox, but they were really good. And the I kind of worked with the owner on that, on coming up with something that would be safe and work and not attract dust and residue that stuff the moment I put it on my fork or my shock, it just instantly makes it feel like butter, instantly. And then, as well as my dropper post, so instantly, just like, Bing, fly right up, if it was having trouble going up. I use that stuff a lot. Jeff Barber 59:53Yeah, I’ve used it for sure, like on a sticky dropper post, one that I like, I actually, you know, probably. Really needed to service it, but, yeah, just put it’s a good band aid. Miles 1:00:05It’s a good band aid. Then I’ll probably, I mean, it comes close with the sticky fingers, the grips, because I don’t ride with gloves. And obviously, when I’m every time I ride, I’m on my brakes, I’m using them so and either times when I take them off, or I have a customer’s bike that I built up, and you know, their option without them, and I’ll do a quick parking lot ride just to make sure everything’s styled and it feels wrong grabbing metal brake levers. It just they almost like, I don’t want to sound like a wimp, but they almost hurt after being so used to the grips. So, you know, I mean, and the four quarts, great too. I have, like, a little plug kit for tubeless plugs, and that has saved me and a bunch of my friends, you know, it’s one of those things, like, is anybody have a spare plug, you know? Like, and I’ve got, yeah, I’ve got 10 of them right here in my steer tube, like a plow, you know, and that’s that one has saved. You know, if you, if you talk to me when I’m like, 15 miles out from a trailhead, 20 miles sometimes, and I got a flat all day. I’m gonna say this is the best product I’ve come out with, for sure, because it’s there and you never forget it. It just sits inside your your head tube. So yeah, but I priced it, yeah, the Wet Seal, and that stuff is, is butter, and there’s been a number of companies that have tried to replicate it over the years, because that stuff’s been out for like, 10 years already. But yeah, my formula is the best. Jeff Barber 1:02:01So, yeah, cool. Well, we talked about the titanium honeymaker that you just rolled out, and then obviously you’re working on the gravel bike. But what else is there? Anything else that’s next for Mullet or Miles Wide you can tell us about? Miles 1:02:21So for Mullet, I’m kind of working on something, which I mean, I would love to share, but if I do, everyone’s gonna kind of jump on it, and I don’t want to, I want to release it and then say, Here surprise. So, yeah, can’t really, you know, the gravel bike is kind of like the next, the next thing you might see, like a teaser of what I’m doing. I mean, I really don’t post on social media. I could totally hire someone, obviously, but it’s just, I don’t I, I don’t think it’s healthy. I don’t know. I’m not. I guess I’m an older generation and I’m not. Yeah, I don’t get into it, but I’ll probably, I’ll probably shoot a shoot out a little teaser of what you could expect, as far as miles wide. I’ve got like a shock grease that which you can use on anything that I’ve been working on. I’ll probably release that in a couple months. It’s really good. And then I’ve got this thing, which I don’t know if the video is, is on or not, but this is like a little four cork attachment thing. And, yeah, I don’t know if this might not be PC to show, but yeah, it’s like, it’s a, it’s a little doohickey that you can I guess smoke oregano out of. And it attaches to the fork cork. And it’s got a little secret storage compartment in here, and then it goes back into, you know, screws onto the fork cork, hides in your steer too. I’ve got that, and I’ve also got a multi tool as well that attaches to the four cork that will probably won’t be ready for a couple more months, and that, you know well, and if you don’t, Jeff Barber 1:04:54if you don’t partake of the oregano, you could use that to put like a have one of those Air Tags, right? That’s a good spot to put an Air Tag so nobody steals your bike. Miles 1:05:04Yeah, people have, like, sent me photos of stuff, of what they stick up their exterior tube. It’s very impressive. I’ve seen like first aid kit to emergency energy bars, like, yeah, a bunch of cash, yeah, it’s, it’s, it’s a hole, you know, might as well fill it with something instead of just leaving it exposed to mud and water. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, and obviously an air cat, yeah, you can totally stick an air tag up there. Jeff Barber 1:05:48Well, miles, it’s been great talking with you today and hearing the backstory behind mullet cycles and miles wide industries, I know our listeners are going to enjoy getting a deeper understanding of Wake what, 321, of what makes your bikes and accessories unique, and we’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for that gravel bike and whatever else you’ve got in the works. So thanks for sharing with us. Miles 1:06:10Hey, thanks so much for having me. So I hope it wasn’t too long, and I hope it was interesting for people. Jeff Barber 1:06:18Oh, it was great.

Full Content:
September 23, 2025 13:57 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

HOUSTON — It's official: Big Pharma is landing in Houston. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) confirmed Sept. 23 that the Bayou City will be part of its domestic manufacturing push. David Ricks, Lilly's CEO and chairman, joined Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to officially announce that the pharmaceutical giant will build a $6.5 billion manufacturing plant in the Generation Park development. That dollar figure is a significant bump from the $5.9 billion Lilly had indicated it would invest when the Indianapolis-based drugmaker filed an application for a tax abatement through Texas' Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation program earlier this year. In August, the Texas Comptroller's Office recommended Lilly's JETI application for approval, meaning the company just needed a final agreement with Abbott's office and Sheldon Independent School District, where the plant will be located.

But while Fold’s stock (Nasdaq: FLD) started off hot on the day, it quickly plunged. The Fold Bitcoin Credit Card will let users accumulate Bitcoin through everyday spending, offering up to 3.5% back on all purchases with no spending categories or deposit requirements, the company said. Users earn an unlimited 2% back instantly, plus up to 1.5% additional when paying through their Fold Checking Account. Enhanced rewards of up to 10% are available with major partners, including Amazon, Target, Home Depot, Uber, Starbucks, and hundreds of other brands. FLD opened at a price of $4.69 on Tuesday after closing at $3.88 on Monday. However, the buzz didn’t last, with the price plunging to $3.32 as of this writing, marking a more than 14% dip on the day. “Our credit card offers clear and compelling value and makes Bitcoin easily accessible to everyone,” said Fold founder, Chairman, and CEO Will Reeves, in a statement. “There are no categories to manage, no tokens to stake, no exchange account or balance requirements; just real Bitcoin, earned automatically with every purchase.” No timeline has been announced for the Fold credit card’s release. Stripe said that it has already processed over $3.1 billion in transaction volume and distributed more than $83 million in Bitcoin rewards. The company also holds 1,485 BTC in its treasury, worth about $167 million at present. Fold’s stock surged on Friday, roughly doubling in price and peaking above $7 per share amid speculation that veteran crypto industry investor Mike Alfred was joining the company. Instead, another publicly traded crypto company, Bakkt, announced Alfred’s appointment to its advisory board on Monday, prompting its own stock spike. Bakkt is up nearly another 18% so far on Tuesday, rising to $17.31 as of this writing. The price of FLD fell on Monday following the Bakkt appointment announcement, and has continued to fall on Tuesday. Even so, FLD remains up about 8% over the last week, though it’s down about 12% on the month. Bitcoin itself is roughly flat on the day at a current price of $112,774, but has fallen about 3% on the week. Myriad Markets users have recently turned bearish on the top cryptocurrency's chances of rising to $125,000—which would be a new all-time high mark—sooner than it can fall to $105,000. As of this writing, 53% of predictors expect it to hit the lower mark sooner than the higher price. That mark has grown substantially over the last week, rising from about 38% on September 16.

As it opens its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, fintech giant Revolut has pledged to invest £3 billion in the UK, creating 1000 new high-skilled jobs over the next five years. 3 23 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Revolut's pledge comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, says: "Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change."Earlier this year, the Financial Times reported that Reeves had clashed with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey over efforts to accelerate Revolut's authorisation as a fully-licenced bank, with Reeves eager to see the fintech get the greenlight as soon as possible.Revolut's UK commitment is part of a wider five-year global plan to invest £10 billion and create 10,000 jobs as it targets 100 million customers by mid 2027 and entry into 30 new markets by 2030.The firm is expecting to launch as a bank in Mexico next year, with entry into Colombia and Argentina also planned. Having secured a payments license in April, it is preparing to launch in India, while a push into Africa is underway, beginning with South Africa.Nik Storonsky, CEO, Revolut, says: “Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. "From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers."

Big Mike’s, the well-known restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, is closing, with its owner citing “insurmountable challenges” in the industry. In a post on Instagram, chef and proprietor Gareth Smith said Sunday was the restaurant’s last service. “This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write. It feels like failure, but it isn’t. We’re proud of what we achieved, we shot for the stars, poured everything into it – heart, soul, sweat, tears, life savings, even the house deposit – but the brutal truth is the maths just don’t math any more,” he wrote. He said he was proud of his team and grateful to his guests and suppliers. “My final act as gaffer is to go to bat for my staff so they land safely in new homes,” he added. A post shared by Big Mike’s Blackrock (@michaels_dublin) [ How Irish restaurants are changing to stay afloat: ‘Less people are going out. Thursday is the new Friday’Opens in new window ] Big Mike’s has been in operation since 2022. In an unusual approach, Mr Smith raised €400,000 of the €1.6 million start-up costs for the restaurant by forward-selling vouchers to a group of 40 regulars in his other outlets, Michael’s and Little Mike’s in Mount Merrion, both of which have since closed.

Title: House Oversight probes whether American retirees' pension funds are being weaponized: 'Progressive playbook'

‘Fox News Sunday’ anchor Shannon Bream previews her show on the FBI raid of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s home and potential charges over alleged confidential emails on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is setting its sights on insurance companies that may have discriminated against entities with right-wing views. The committee is also looking into whether retirees' pension accounts were being used to invest in progressive policies they may not necessarily agree with, Fox News Digital has learned. "The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating improper restrictions on access to capital and capital markets of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries (such as cryptocurrency, energy, and firearms)," Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). "The Committee has engaged with whistleblowers who had their insurance policies cancelled for widely-held political positions or for operating legal businesses considered out of favor by progressive activists." HOUSE PASSES TRUMP-BACKED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer is expanding his probe into financial discrimination against right-wing entities and people. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The move is an expansion of the House Oversight Committee's ongoing investigation into whether public financial institutions engaged in debanking against people and entities with right-wing views. Comer is also probing whether companies implementing progressive policies are doing so at the expense of millions of retired Americans' personal investments. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in his capacity as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that his panel "is investigating the prolific use of proxy proposals and other activism targeting corporate boards of directors by activists pursuing political agendas at the expense of the retirement and personal savings of Americans." BILL BARR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T SEE INFO THAT WOULD 'IMPLICATE' TRUMP IN EPSTEIN CASE, COMER SAYS "Specifically, the Committee seeks to understand how giant investment managers and pension fund managers, aided by proxy advisory firms, sidestepped or abandoned their fiduciary duties to beneficiaries to pursue a political agenda and whether new legislation is needed to protect investors," Comer stated. "At a minimum, Americans deserve to fully know if their hard-earned savings are being used in a progressive playbook." The letter accused certain large asset management firms like BlackRock of putting clients' money into green energy initiatives, for example, rather than more profitable areas, in order to promote a left-wing agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is pictured during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2025. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images) BlackRock pushed back on such accusations in a public statement on its website, however. "One of the most critical tasks of an asset manager is to provide clients with insights on short- and long-term trends in the global economy that can impact their portfolios. We do this across all sectors – from healthcare to technology to energy," the company wrote. "Climate risk is one such trend given its implications for the economy. We believe that companies that better manage their exposure to climate risk and capitalize on opportunities will generate better long term financial outcomes." BlackRock's website also asserted that the "choice of where to invest ultimately rests with our clients." "We are bound to adhere to their investment guidelines and objectives. We do not dictate particular investment strategies," it said. And on a broader scale, the committee looking into whether publicly-traded companies are running afoul of President Donald Trump's executive order outlawing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices by simply listing it under another name. "[T]he Committee remains concerned following reports of publicly traded companies intentionally camouflaging or rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies to hide such discrimination from "the Trump Administration, courts or influential activists,'" Comer wrote to several organizations opposing corporate discrimination, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. "At minimum, shareholders and retirement plan beneficiaries deserve transparency around discriminatory practices employed by corporate directors and officers as such behavior is rebranded. Replacing DEI and ESG titles with 'employee engagement' or ‘inclusion and impact’ represents yet another deceptive practice." President Donald Trump walks to Air Force One at Morristown Airport on Sept. 14, 2025, in Morristown, New Jersey. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump's order, signed in January 2025, barred financial institutions, major corporations, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies and specific industries like medicine and commercial airlines from promoting or implementing DEI standards. Comer accused the previous White House of promoting discriminatory practices, however, in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The Oversight Committee is investigating discriminatory practices in the American financial system and the Biden Administration’s role in supporting them," he wrote. "Whether it is using the boardroom to achieve what the political left could not accomplish at the ballot box, or canceling Americans’ insurance policies and debanking them for their political views, these actions are wrong and deprive Americans of their constitutional rights." Fox News Digital reached out to the IRS and NAIC for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Once a month, from 1989 to 2019, David Blitzer walked into a well-appointed conference room with a view of downtown Manhattan to discuss the 500 largest and most important public companies in the U.S., the ones whose stock just about any American can buy. Blitzer was a member of, and then chair of, the committee that makes the S&P 500. It's like the Billboard Hot 100, except instead of ranking the most popular songs in America, it lists the most valuable companies. Sabrina Carpenter wants to keep releasing pop anthems that keep her on the charts; Boeing wants to keep selling enough planes to stay in the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is famous. It's cited constantly in newspapers and on TV; it's the basis of millions of investing-for-retirement plans. Less well-known is that S&P Global, the company that makes the S&P 500 and that employed Blitzer, is itself on the S&P 500 list. One reason why is that S&P Global makes hundreds of millions of dollars every year in revenue just from the S&P 500. The company has other larger businesses, like rating bonds, but its indexing business is particularly lucrative and profitable. How do you profit wildly from a list of stocks that seemingly anyone could make? And why don't competitors erode those profits? Answering those questions requires a better understanding of the infrastructure behind Americans' go-to investing plan. It also shows how millions of Americans have, often unknowingly, bet their life savings on a few tech giants and the hundreds of billions of dollars they've invested in artificial intelligence. Loading... The S&P 500 is what's known as a stock market index, and its purpose is to be a barometer. Is the stock market up today? Was it down last week? Until the late 1800s, those were not easy questions to answer. But in 1896, financial journalists Charles Dow and Edward Jones created the Dow Jones index by averaging the share price of 12 large public companies. (It later expanded to 30 large stocks.) They used it to inform their columns and increase sales of their flagship paper, The Wall Street Journal. In 1957, S&P released a competitor: its now-iconic list of 500 stocks. At the time, it was a triumph of new technology. Tracking 500 stocks and updating the index took much more work and computing power, especially since S&P updated the index hourly, rather than just once per day. (Now it's updated constantly, in almost real time.) Also, the S&P 500 accounts for the size of each company and the number of shares. It was an improvement on the Dow Jones Industrial Average's price-weighted approach. In the Dow, companies with higher share prices have a larger impact on the index. So Goldman Sachs, whose share price is around $802, is much more important than Apple, whose share price is around $245.50. In contrast, the S&P 500 is weighted for market capitalization, the total amount invested in each company (the share price x number of shares outstanding). So if Netflix stock is up 1% and Apple is down 1%, that will nudge the S&P 500 down. Which makes sense! Way more people have way more money invested in Apple ($3.5 trillion) than Netflix (just over $500 billion). So, overall, investors had a down day. The S&P 500 is widely considered superior to the Dow for tracking the state of the stock market. Nevertheless, when David Blitzer joined the S&P 500 committee in 1989, the Dow was still the definitive stock market index. People in finance respected the S&P 500 — many professional investors used the index as a benchmark to see whether they were "beating the market," and they paid for access to the S&P 500 and related data. But it wasn't much money. Just a few years earlier, in 1982, "the income was zilch, almost," Blitzer says. So what changed? Three new financial products helped turn the S&P 500 into the dominant index and a golden goose: In each case, the companies paid to use the S&P 500 name, data and methodology. That fee was based on how much money people invested in S&P 500 index funds and ETFs (or spent on S&P 500 futures). So if a schoolteacher invested $30,000 of retirement savings in Vanguard's S&P 500 fund, Vanguard might charge that teacher $15 per year and give S&P a chunk of that $15. These novel products did not immediately make the S&P 500 a gold mine. The products were new, and investors were skeptical. So S&P's fees were modest. Blitzer says that when he became chair of the committee, in 1995, there were around 25 employees devoted to the S&P 500 and two other indexes they published. But "it grew incredibly," he adds. "You know, it was a good ride." A key period, Blitzer says, came in the late 1990s, as the dot-com bubble inflated. New internet companies like Yahoo grew and grew, and Blitzer and his colleagues duly added them to the S&P 500. (Yahoo replaced Laidlaw, North America's largest bus operator. "What it says is that the internet slowly but surely is becoming a key part of the U.S. economy," Blitzer told reporters in 1999.) The manic increases in internet stock prices pushed the S&P 500 up and up. "For 15 or 20 months, or maybe two years or more, the S&P 500 outperformed like 90% of all the mutual funds and ETFs in the market," says Blitzer. In other words, Wall Street's elite money managers — whom Americans gladly paid fat fees every year to invest their savings for them — were making lower returns (less per dollar invested, especially after accounting for fees) from the stock market than people who'd bought SPY or Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund. Blitzer's simple list of 500 stocks was one of the hottest portfolios on Wall Street, and getting access to it was cheap. The fees for SPY and index funds were a fraction of what elite Wall Street firms charged. So more and more families moved their retirement savings out of the hands of those active investors and into S&P 500 funds. What they were essentially doing was betting that America's 500 largest companies would keep growing and making profits — which is a pretty good, safe bet. The creators of the index chose 500 companies because it approximated the entire stock market: S&P 500 companies typically represent more than 75% of the entire American stock market (in terms of size, or market capitalization). And even as internet and tech stocks made up a larger and larger share of the S&P 500, people who bought SPY or index funds were still well diversified, since they were also investing in energy, health care and consumer-goods companies — which cushioned their losses when the tech bubble burst. This trend of people moving their retirement savings into index funds and ETFs has continued for decades. By the time Blitzer stepped down as chair of the S&P 500 committee in 2019, he says, their index business employed around 700 people, and they'd created so many indexes (the S&P Southeast Asia 40, the S&P Emerging Under $2 Billion, the S&P Municipal Bond Water & Sewer Index) that he legitimately did not know how many existed. (In the early 2010s, S&P also bought a controlling stake in the Dow Jones indexes; Dow Jones & Co. retains some affiliation with the indexes, but no ownership.) But the S&P 500 remains the crown jewel. In 2024, S&P Global earned $1.6 billion in revenue from its indexes business. Most of that revenue came from firms paying to use the S&P name for $16.6 trillion of index funds and other investments. Of that $16.6 trillion, a whopping $13 trillion came from SPY, Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund and similar investments. As a director and senior analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, Sean Kennedy closely follows seven companies so he can advise customers on whether to buy, hold or sell their stock. S&P Global is one of them. I ask whether he ever worries about S&P's indexes business faltering. "No," he responds instantly. "I think their moat is so impenetrable," he says, that customers ask him only really about other parts of S&P Global's business. By a "moat," Kennedy means the factors that prevent competitors from launching their own indexes and conquering S&P's castle (i.e., its customers and business). According to Kennedy and Blitzer, that moat consists of three main factors: The S&P 500 does have competitors. The London Stock Exchange Group has the Russell Indices, and MSCI publishes popular ones too. But their most prominent indexes are complements to the S&P 500, rather than competitors. From the perspective of S&P's customers, says Kennedy, "there's really no one you can switch to." What also sets the S&P 500 apart is the committee that Blitzer headed up for more than two decades. Even many finance experts are surprised to learn that it exists. They expect the S&P 500 to be like a formula: You calculate which companies are the 500 largest, in terms of share price and number of shares, and then publish the list. S&P publishes its methodology on its website, but it leaves some wiggle room to achieve other goals of the index, such as mitigating turnover and keeping the list representative of the broader market. That wiggle room was Blitzer's domain. In the early 1990s, for example, the committee held off on adding Microsoft to the index because founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen still owned more than 50% of the shares. In other cases, if two companies merged, creating one corporation large enough to make the S&P 500, the committee might similarly wait to see how the new company (and its stock price) fared before adding it. Blitzer said in a 2020 Bloomberg podcast that they sometimes "got pounded" for these decisions but "learned to shrug our shoulders and say wait till next month." He also suspects the committee's existence, as well as the fact that no one could fully predict the list, gave the S&P 500 some "aura." Potential changes were always a gossipy topic in business and finance. Even within the S&P office, no one knew for sure what Blitzer would announce. Since Blitzer retired in 2019, it's now someone else's job to pick the 500 stocks and endure the criticism. (That's now easier, however, because S&P keeps all members of the committee anonymous, in part so CEOs would stop FedEx-ing them quarterly reports and financial literature to lobby for inclusion in the S&P 500.) The biggest criticism in recent years, though, is not about a specific stock. It's that the S&P 500 no longer broadly represents the stock market. Just seven tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft and Apple — have grown so huge that they make up more than 30% of the S&P 500. Increasingly, when the S&P 500 goes up or down, it reflects the performance of these "Magnificent 7" tech companies. Many economists, financial experts and money managers are concerned. Millions of people have invested trillions of dollars in S&P 500 funds with the idea that it's a well-diversified portfolio — a bet on the entire U.S. economy (or at least the large slice of it available to buy on stock markets), not a bet mostly on continued iPhone profits and AI chatbots becoming a profitable business. There are alternatives on offer. Firms like Vanguard offer index funds and other easy ways to invest in indexes of smaller companies, midsize companies, international stock markets or the "total" U.S. stock market — or to diversify into real estate. But as Blitzer points out, the Magnificent 7's domineering influence does not mean the S&P 500 is broken. The S&P 500 may be "pretty top heavy right now," but it has been top heavy before, in periods like the dot-com boom, and it still represents some 80% of American stock markets. The S&P 500 is doing its job: reflecting the state of the stock market and the investments everyone has decided to make. The point of the S&P 500 and the many investments based on it is to follow the markets — to trust its crowdsourced intelligence and not second-guess it or think you individually know better — because even though markets are sometimes very wrong, trusting them has an excellent track record over the long run. This is simply the state of our economy in 2025. Like it or not, it's increasingly a huge bet on a few tech giants and their massive investments in artificial intelligence startups, new data centers and AI being the next big thing.

Title: BlackRock’s crypto ETFs generate $260 million annual revenue

Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:59:53Z

BlackRock’s cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have emerged as a highly profitable venture, generating $260 million in annualized revenue, according to recent data shared by Leon Waidmann, head of research at the nonprofit Onchain Foundation. The revenue includes $218 million from Bitcoin ETFs and $42 million from Ether-based products. The performance underscores the growing role of regulated crypto investment products in institutional finance. BlackRock’s success is being closely watched by other traditional asset managers as a potential benchmark for launching similar offerings in the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Analysts highlight the significance of BlackRock’s ETFs in positioning cryptocurrencies as a serious asset class within traditional finance. Waidmann likened the ETFs’ trajectory to Amazon’s early business model, noting that the funds provide a practical entry point into the crypto ecosystem for institutional investors and retirement accounts. “This isn’t experimentation anymore,” Waidmann said. “The world’s largest asset manager has proven that crypto is a serious profit center. That’s a quarter-billion-dollar business, built almost overnight. For comparison, many fintech unicorns don’t make that in a decade.” The performance of these ETFs may encourage more institutional players to enter the crypto market, extending the current market cycle beyond the typical four-year Bitcoin halving-driven patterns. Analysts suggest that inflows from corporate treasuries and ETF products could continue to drive demand for both Bitcoin and Ether. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is approaching a significant milestone, with total assets under management (AUM) nearing $85 billion. This accounts for approximately 57.5% of the total US spot Bitcoin ETF market, according to blockchain data from Dune. By comparison, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF holds $22.8 billion, representing 15.4% of market share, making it the second-largest US spot Bitcoin ETF. The rapid growth of BlackRock’s fund is noteworthy given its short history, debuting on January 11, 2024. In less than two years, it has climbed from being the 31st largest fund across both crypto and traditional ETFs to the 22nd largest, according to VettaFi. Market analysts are optimistic that continued ETF inflows could support a renewed rally in Bitcoin prices. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget exchange, suggested that the institutional appetite for crypto ETFs helps establish a bullish floor for risk assets, reinforcing a “buy the dip” strategy amid ongoing macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Additionally, there is speculation that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in US 401(k) retirement plans could further bolster demand for Bitcoin, with some projections estimating potential price targets as high as $200,000 by year-end, according to André Dragosch, head of European research at crypto asset manager Bitwise. BlackRock’s crypto ETFs illustrate the increasing intersection of traditional finance with the digital asset market. The funds’ performance demonstrates not only the profitability of regulated crypto products but also their capacity to attract institutional capital and provide a structured entry point for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape.

Title: I've had an executive Costco membership for 10 years. It pays for itself — and then some.

Costco has always been a part of my life. I remember taking family trips to the warehouse as a kid and sharing soft-serve with my siblings. When I moved away for college, I still asked my parents to take me to Costco, often "borrowing" their membership card for big shopping trips to stock up on food and household items. Later, my partner and I went all in, splurging on our own executive membership and even getting the Costco Citi card. Now, as adults, we're at Costco multiple times each month, filling up on everything from gas to groceries. We make almost all our large purchases there, and have even booked Costco vacation packages. As a longtime shopper, I can confidently say the benefits of a Costco executive membership are worthwhile. Here's why I think it's worth upgrading to the higher membership tier. A standard Costco membership costs $65 a year, and the executive version is double the price at $130 annually. However, we recover the cost of the upgrade just by making qualifying purchases at the warehouse. That's because the executive membership comes with a 2% cash back reward, which allows shoppers to earn up to $1,250 back on qualifying pre-tax purchases. To break it down, this means that if we spend about $3,250 a year at Costco, we earn back the cost of the executive membership upgrade. If we spend a little more, we're making money to spend at the warehouse. Once a year — about two months before our membership renews — Costco sends a cash back voucher, which can be redeemed on future purchases. Plus, Costco has a membership satisfaction guarantee, meaning the company will refund the price of the membership at any time if you're not satisfied with it. In addition to the 2% cash back perk, Costco executive members can often access extra benefits. For example, the company recently started giving executive members a $10 monthly credit to use on same-day delivery through Instacart. The credit is automatically applied at checkout when we spend $150 (before tax). After returning home from vacation, this perk was a game changer. Instead of fighting the weekend Costco crowds to stock up on our favorite products, our groceries were delivered promptly to our doorstep. We were even able to snag a coveted rotisserie chicken. And speaking of vacations, executive members also get extra benefits on trips booked through Costco Travel. A few years ago, I purchased an all-inclusive vacation package to Costa Rica. As part of the deal, my friend and I each received $50 to use at the spa and a complimentary fruit basket for our room. Earlier this year, Costco announced it would be opening its doors for an additional six and a half hours each week for US executive members. Now, we can begin shopping at the warehouse an hour early on weekdays and Sundays. On Saturdays, we can enter half an hour earlier than other members. We recently attended this special shopping hour on a Sunday and noticed a stark difference. For example, my store typically has a line out the door to get in at opening, but we were able to stroll right in without bumping into anyone. We didn't even have to wait in line to check out. We'll likely make it a habit to go during these exclusive hours, as it made for a much better experience overall. I've been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Costco's greatest draws are its ability to provide value for the price and an unbeatable customer experience. For my partner and me, paying for the executive membership is a no-brainer. The 2% cash back means our $130 annual membership pays for itself. Plus, we love having access to all the premium perks. Jump to

Title: Steven Pinker on Speculation Bubbles, Super Bowl Ads, and What Leaders Need to Know About Group Psychology

A conversation with psychology professor Steven Pinker on a powerful force that unites us. As a leader, psychology is fundamental to your success – whether that means understanding consumer behavior, team dynamics, or even your own biases and blind spots. Harvard professor Steven Pinker says that an important phenomena to understand is that of common knowledge and its downstream effects. It’s the idea that there is power in knowledge, but also power in knowing what other people know – and that when a large group of people know what others around them know, and vice versa, that’s when major change can happen. He explains how common knowledge underlies meme stocks, the rise of crypto, meeting etiquette and the success of Super Bowl ads. Pinker wrote the new book When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows . . .: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. ADI IGNATIUS: I’m Adi Ignatius. ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard, and this is the HBR IdeaCast. ADI IGNATIUS: All right. So Alison, the more I think about leadership, the more I think that leading effectively is almost all about psychology. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, I can see what you mean. You need to understand consumers’ wants and needs, your employees’ wants and needs, your business partner’s wants and needs. Really anticipating everything that stakeholders might do or think. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, exactly. I think successful leaders need to think on multiple levels, both to cope with the complexity of their jobs and to outthink their competition. So our guest today, Steven Pinker, is all about the power of knowledge. Understanding what we know, what we don’t know, and most importantly, whether or not others know what we know. So I know that sounds very Donald Rumsfeldian, but there is power in understanding all of this. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, it does sound very meta, but Pinker is an expert in explaining very complex topics in a way that feels understandable and applicable to our everyday lives. So I’m interested to hear what he has to say. ADI IGNATIUS: Absolutely. So Pinker is a professor of psychology at Harvard University, author of the new book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. It’s a book that helps explain everything from the power of Super Bowl ads to the rise of cryptocurrency, to the unspoken rules of how we interact in the office. Here’s our conversation. ADI IGNATIUS: Steven, thank you for being with us today. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me. ADI IGNATIUS: Great. So, your book is about common knowledge, what it is and how we use it and in ways that we’re aware of and in ways that we aren’t aware of. So, for the audience, what are you getting at with common knowledge and why should we care about that? STEVEN PINKER: I’m using the term specialized sense, not to refer to conventional wisdom or something that is widely known, but to something that is known to be known. That is I know something, you know it. You know that I know it. I know that you know it. You know that I know that you know it, and so on ad infinitum. So, that’s common knowledge in the technical sense. It’s important because it’s necessary for coordination for two or more people to be on the same page to make choices that might be arbitrary, but it works for everyone as long as everyone makes the same choice. Do you stay home on Saturday or Sunday? Do you drive on the right or drive on the left? Now for common knowledge to work, you don’t literally have to think, “I know that she knows it. I know that she knows.” Because your head starts to spin after one or two levels, and technically, common knowledge requires an infinite number of them, which can’t fit inside a single head. But we have a sense of common knowledge when something is conspicuous or self-evident or public or out there. If I see it while I see you seeing it, then I know that you know that I know that you know it. ADI IGNATIUS: So this is the emperor has new clothes. STEVEN PINKER: Well, I begin the book with the story of the emperor’s new clothes because there’s a sense in which it’s a story about common knowledge. When the little boy said the emperor was naked, he wasn’t telling anyone anything they didn’t already know. But he’s changed the state of their knowledge nonetheless because by blurting out what everyone could see within earshot of everyone else, at that moment, everyone knew that everyone else knew that everyone else knew that the emperor was naked. And another point in the book is that just like driving on the right or driving on the left is a solution to a coordination problem or staying home Saturday or staying home Sunday, respecting paper currency, I suggest that our informal social relationships. Are we friends? Do I defer to you? Are we transactional partners? Are we lovers? All of those are matters of common knowledge as well. They’re coordination games and we solidify them by generating some public signal that we both see that inaugurates the relationship. There can be forms of common belief, common misconception, common pretense where you do have assumptions about what other people are thinking and vice versa, that in some cases may not actually be a reality. In the case of a common pretense where we refer to that by saying, “We’re ignoring the elephant in the room,” the metaphor is that an elephant in the room is something you can’t ignore, but we’re pretending to ignore it. Sometimes there is a phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance or a spiral of silence. In economics, it’s sometimes called the Abilene Paradox, where no one actually believes something, but everyone thinks that everyone else believes it, but no one actually does. ADI IGNATIUS: Is there an easy example of that? STEVEN PINKER: Sure. It was originally studied in a fraternity where all the frat guys said privately that it’s really stupid to drink until you puke and pass out. But they said, “What can I do about it? All the other guys think it’s cool.” It turns out none of them thought it was cool, but everyone thought that everyone else thought it was cool. There’ve been many phenomena like that. It turns out that in Saudi Arabia, most of the men think that women should have the right to work and drive, but they couldn’t allow their wives to do it because they mistakenly thought that all the other men thought that it was impermissible. ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to lead this conversation mainly into economic, financial, market areas but your book, I’d say it’s challenging in some ways. There are a lot of brain-teasers, there are a lot of prisoner’s dilemmas, things like that, but it’s also fun. I mean there are a lot of popular references, jokes, cartoons, and then examples. So, one of the things you talk about is the Keynesian beauty contest. Which – and if I get it wrong, you’ll correct me, but where a judge doesn’t simply select the contestant that he or she thinks is the most attractive, but rather is rewarded on selecting based on what he or she thinks the other judges will select, right? STEVEN PINKER: Who are engaged in the same puzzle. ADI IGNATIUS: In the same thing. STEVEN PINKER: They’re guessing what everyone else will judge to be the prettiest face, which is different from the old Miss Rheingold competition where people voted on the prettiest face. In the beauty contest that Keynes hinted might have been in the newspapers in his day, this would be London in the ’20s. No one can ever actually verify whether there really was such of a contest. But it was a great example because for Keynes where he said, “Everyone is trying to out-guess other people out-guessing still other people.” He said, “That’s the way speculative investing works.” They buy the security because they think they can sell it at a higher price to other people who think it’s underpriced, who in turn will want to sell it to still other people. Speculative bubbles, crypto perhaps being one of the most recent examples, are cases where people think that other people in the future will want to buy in, something that’s called the greater fool theory of investing that you invest because you think other people will invest because they think that still other people will invest. The thing is, of course, bubbles can pop when the market starts to run out of the greater fools who think that it’ll continue to appreciate forever. But this can all get started when there is some public signal. In the case of the emperor’s new clothes, the boy blurting it out, or like a public ceremony or a public signal where if there is just a rumor or some reason to think that other people are getting in, that can cause other people to get in. A couple of recent examples are meme stocks where an influencer might talk up a stock even if the fundamentals are terrible, pretty crummy. But the fact that other people know that he’s talking it up and they know that still other people are talking up means that it really can appreciate at least for a while. Two Super Bowls ago, there were a number of high concept ads for crypto exchanges, which mentioned nothing about the advantages of crypto. ADI IGNATIUS: I remember that. These are the Larry David ads. STEVEN PINKER: The Larry David, the Matt Damon, where the point of the ads were everyone’s getting into crypto, don’t be left out. In fact, the punchline to the Larry David comic ad was, “Don’t be like Larry, don’t be left out.” ADI IGNATIUS: So this sounds like a tool that people who understand the psychology could and probably do benefit from, right? STEVEN PINKER: Yes. Getting back to marketing, I talk about an analysis by a political scientist like Michael Chwe, who is in some ways my predecessor in writing a book about common knowledge where he analyzed the most famous and most expensive ad in history. This was the 1984 ad directed by Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and Alien and Fame. It ran exactly once during the 1984 Super Bowl and it was to introduce the Apple Macintosh. It was a revolutionary new product. Unlike those of us who remember the first personal computers, remember it had a little screen with 24 lines of 80 characters and you had to type in alphanumeric commands like del, fubar, fu.bar, and they were error-prone. They were clumsy. So, Apple’s coming out this insanely great new product with windows and menus and icons and a mouse. But they realized that no one would buy it if they thought they were the only one buying it because the price wouldn’t come down because of demand. There wouldn’t be a community of users and experts. So, how do you break the knot and cut the knot and get people to buy something that they’ll only buy if other people are buying it? The answer is the Super Bowl is an annual right in American culture. You know that a lot of people are watching it and you know that a lot of people know that a lot of people are watching it. It is a common knowledge generator. To break the logjam, Apple paid for this ad. It said nothing about the Apple computer, for those of you who have seen it. It played off the fact that it was January 1984, the date of George Orwell’s novel. So, it showed a grim corporate meeting where gray drones trudge into a cavernous hall and listen to drivel from a voice on the screen, intercut with scenes of a live young woman in a bright red gym shorts and a singlet carrying a mallet. She bursts into the corporate meeting, hammer throws the mallet into the screen, which explodes in a fireball revealing the crawl that says on January 25th, Apple will introduce the Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984. Now, the point of the ad was not to advertise the product, it didn’t say anything about the product, but to advertise the audience for the potential buyership. It generated common knowledge. I’m seeing the ad. I know lots of other companies are seeing the ad. What Chwe showed… I mean, it’s a story. How did he prove it? I mean, that’s just a sample of one. So, he looked at other products that only work if enough other people adopt it, products that depend on network effects. Monster.com was one of the first job-seeking ads. Now, why would anyone look for a job on Monster.com unless they thought that lots of employers were posting there? Why would employers post there unless they thought a lot of job seekers were looking for jobs there? Monster.com was introduced at the Super Bowl. Another example is the Discover credit card, which was great credit card, rebates, and high limits, but didn’t matter if you were the only one who had a Discover card because no merchant would accept it and no merchant would accept it unless they thought enough people were going to carry it, introduced in the Super Bowl. Chwe argued that it was another category aside from products that inherently depend on networks, they’re prestige goods that depend on other people that you respect also consuming that product. As far as language, sneakers are sneakers, but for some people, it matters whether they’re the person who wears Nikes or Adidas. An American beer is American beer, but for some people, like being a Bud drinker is just different from being a Coors drinker and products that are consumed in public and where the brand image is important also tend to advertise in the Super Bowl. Crucially, what Chwe showed was not so much that advertisers willing to pay per eyeball, but they’re willing to pay a premium for venues that were common knowledge generators, where it was known that a lot of people were to watch them. They’re willing to pay more per eyeball for products that were consumed in public or that depended on network effects. ADI IGNATIUS: So, maybe the flip side of this phenomenon is the toilet paper shortage during COVID, which was not this, not network effects, but an assumption that I know what you know that I know that you know that. STEVEN PINKER: Well, yes. So, economist named Justin Wolfers speculated that the great COVID toilet paper shortage was like a bank run where people withdraw their money, not necessarily because they think that there’s anything wrong with the bank, but they have heard that other people think there might be something wrong on the sound. They might just have heard that other people think that might be something. That that’s not how it sounds. So, you get this reverberant doubt, and no one wants to be the last customer withdrawing at a point where the bank no longer can cover its deposits. So, people rush to the bank to withdraw their savings, which actually causes the bank to fail, which otherwise it wouldn’t. Likewise, Wolfers suggested that there actually wasn’t a toilet paper shortage. It’s true that people were staying home. So, they were using six packs of Charmin, instead of the big jumbo rolls in their workplace. But Kimberly-Clark quickly stepped up production to meet the demand, but somehow people just know that in an emergency, people hoard toilet paper, which can cause the very shortage that leads people to hoard toilet paper. So, they did hoard toilet paper. A lot of retailers then posted signs, max three rolls per customer. ADI IGNATIUS: That reinforced it. STEVEN PINKER: And that ended the shortage. Not so much because people didn’t strip the shelves because they couldn’t, but they were reassured that since no one else could buy more than three rolls, there was no reason for them to panic. Again, getting back to common knowledge, how did this originate? At least according to one history, it all started with another common knowledge generator, the Tonight Show, which back in the three network era, Johnny Carson was the king of late night. He had not only a huge audience, but people knew that people were watching Johnny Carson, which is why catchphrases from the show like, “Here’s Johnny,” everyone recognized it. So, one night, I think it was 1973, he said, “There’ve been all kinds of shortages lately.” This was an era where there were lines to get gasoline because of the Arab oil embargo and there was a meat shortage and a coffee shortage. He said, “Have you heard the latest? I read it in the papers. There’s a shortage of toilet paper.” Now it turned out it wasn’t true at the time. There was no shortage of toilet paper, but then that created a shortage of toilet paper when everyone ran out to buy it. Since then, at least according to the story, it’s hard to proof, it’s just become conventional wisdom that toilet paper becomes scarce in an emergency. ADI IGNATIUS: All of this must be very valuable for people who are in negotiation, right? Because negotiation is always, “What is it that we both know, and what is it that only I know?” I mean that’s how you win. But yeah, talk about to what extent I know, you know… That’s the fundamental of the people who negotiate better probably understand this concept better. STEVEN PINKER: Yeah. So, negotiation is one of a number of kinds of games in the game theory sense, meaning my best option depends on what you do and vice versa. In any time in which there can be multiple equilibria, cases where everyone is better off if they both do something, but it isn’t preordained what they’ll do. So, the negotiation is what’s sometimes called a battle of the sexes is the technical term. It has nothing actually to do with the sexes, but it refers to a hypothetical couple where they like to spend time together. He would prefer that they go to the hockey game. She would prefer they go to the opera. They’d rather go to either than not do something together. The question is, which one do they go to? Both of them are equilibria. In the case of negotiation, let’s say a car salesman and a buyer. There’s a range of prices in which the salesman makes a profit and the customer pays what they’re willing to pay to get the car. But within that range, the highest the customer is willing to pay, the lowest the seller is willing to sell for, how do they decide? Obviously, the seller wants it as high as possible, the buyer wants it as low as possible. If either of them walks away from the deal, then they’re both worse off. So, how do they decide? So there are many predicaments in life like this where there are many ways of doing something, but both parties are better off if they can figure out some way to do it. In the case of a negotiation, it’s interesting. This is something pointed out many years ago by the political scientist, Thomas Shelley, who won a Nobel Prize for this and other work, that often a buyer and seller in order to find somewhere, anywhere to land on that the other guy will agree with, they’ll pick something like splitting the difference or a round number. He notes that the salesman, who announced that his rock bottom price for the car is $30,007.26, is pretty much pleading to be relieved of $7.26. It’s like, “Oh, come on.” So why a round number? I mean, what’s so special about a round number? What’s special is other people can think it’s special or can expect each other to recognize it as special. So, these points, focal points, sometimes called shelling points, points that pop out in the minds of both parties and that’s all they need to come to an agreement are often where negotiations end up. ADI IGNATIUS: When you talk about common knowledge, particularly some of the early references, it seems a different era than where we are now. Maybe this was never true, but people my age will look back and say, “Well, we used to agree on facts.” We probably didn’t altogether, but we did, right? As you say, there were only three networks that wasn’t this ubiquity of opinion and everything. Now we’re really in an era where they’re competing truths and I would assume competing common knowledges. Obviously, there’s various common knowledges between people and in relationships, but at a larger level, I guess my question is, is that eroding the common knowledge that enables social interaction, et cetera? Is that a concern for you? STEVEN PINKER: There is that fear, although as you say and I often point out that the best explanation for the good old days is a bad memory. There’s a lot of polarization in the ’60s too, riots and terrorist bombings and assassinations and so on. Duly not romanticizing the past, there does seem to be an increase in negative polarization that is not just that people disagree, but each thinks that the other is evil. It’s plausible that one of the contributors was the fragmentation of the media markets. So, that instead of everyone watching Walter Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley, first with cable news, with Fox News, whose business model was to cultivate a highly partisan audience that wants to hear a certain spin on everything and with social media where the networks of posting and reposting and tweeting and retweeting and linking and relinking has been shown to take place within two or more closed networks with not much interaction between that there could be separate pools of common belief within each of these communities. Something that’s easier to happen when there isn’t one public signal, a Super Bowl, a Johnny Carson, a Walter Cronkite that everyone knows that everyone knows is aware of. ADI IGNATIUS: Okay, so anyway, so this concept of common knowledge existing in different ways in different forms of relationships. So, within a company, if an executive, if a leader wants to create a common knowledge that he or she imagines would be beneficial for the culture of the company, is there a playbook almost for how to create a positive common knowledge within this environment? STEVEN PINKER: Well, in general, common knowledge is generated by something that is conspicuous, public. So, face-to-face meetings can generate common knowledge in a way that, say, remote meetings don’t. That is when you’re in a room, you see everyone else, they see you, they know that they’re seeing each other and seeing the speaker or the leader. So, I think that’s one of the reasons that as with the Super Bowl, which is a broadcast version, but there is an important role for publicly conspicuous notices, sometimes pronouncements. Going back to the economy as a whole, the reason that statements from the Fed are scrutinized and poured over like rabbis parsing the Talmud is that anything that the chairman of the Fed says can create its own reality when people knowing that other people have heard it will act on it out of anticipation of what other people will do, which can then feed on itself and create a bubble, a recession. So, I quote Alan Greenspan, who at one point said, “Since I’ve become chair of the Fed, I’ve learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” Because a signal that, say, a recession is ahead will create that recession because companies won’t hire out of fear that they’ll have to lay off employees. Consumers won’t buy out of fear that they might lose their jobs, each of which then creates the reality of the other. So, the chairman of that has to be very, very careful as to what she or he says. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah. What’s interesting in all of this… You talk about politics in some ways, you talk about authoritarian politics. I lived in China and I lived in Russia and you did have the phenomenon that you described, which is everybody knows that the regime is rotten, but nobody says it because you can’t be certain if you take the streets, there’s going to be anybody else with you, even though everybody knows. Then you understand why you have to control everything because the moment you loosen up anything, it allows for this possibility of communication and understanding. It is like that moment when Ceausescu fell in Romania and he’d controlled everything. Suddenly, there’s people shouting in the back as he’s giving a speech and some stuff’s happening. He realizes it’s over because it’s either complete control or no control. STEVEN PINKER: In particular, since no dictator can control every last member of the population, there just isn’t enough firepower. There aren’t enough informants. As I quote the character of Gandhi in the movie by that name ADI IGNATIUS: Ben Kingsley… STEVEN PINKER: Who at one point tells a British colonial officer, “In the end, you’ll leave because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians if the Indians refuse to cooperate.” He could have said, “Refuse to coordinate or are unable to coordinate.” So people can overpower a regime if they all stand up at the same time, if they all storm the palace, if they all stop work. But how can they do it if each one is afraid that he’ll be the only one? If he stands up, he can be picked off or bundled off to prison. If everyone protests at the same time, then there’s the safety in numbers, but there’s safety in coordination. So, there has to be a way of generating the common knowledge. Now’s the time that we all stand up together. So, protest in a public square where everyone sees everyone else seeing everyone else can often do it, which is why dictators are often terrified of public protests. Or if there is a widely circulated magazine, TV show, radio show, which is why they clamp down on the media. ADI IGNATIUS: Talk about the blank paper. STEVEN PINKER: Oh yeah. So, there’s a joke from the Soviet Union about a man handing out leaflets in red square. Of course, the KGB arrest him. They bundle him off to police headquarters, only discover that the leaflets are blank sheets of paper, and they confront him. They demand, “What is the meaning of this?”, and he says, “What’s there to say? It’s so obvious.” So the point of the joke was he was generating common knowledge. He didn’t need to say anything because people already knew it, but they didn’t know that everyone else knew it. And in a case of life imitating a joke, Putin’s police force has arrested a number of people for carrying blank signs. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, well, I wonder if it was before. So, that in China where it’s very dangerous to protest and very dangerous to dissent publicly, after the mishandling of COVID, there were famously blank paper protests. STEVEN PINKER: Oh, interesting. ADI IGNATIUS: Possibly inspired by the original- STEVEN PINKER: Joke. ADI IGNATIUS: … Soviet joke. Yeah. So, the book is fascinating and you put your finger on common knowledge and how we know what we know and how we think about certain things and how we operate. What are we supposed to do with all that? STEVEN PINKER: Well, it’s hard to answer that question because I didn’t write it as a how-to book or as a manual or self-help. It’s a work in fundamental science and logic and philosophy with lots and lots of applications. How you work it out in a particular case often depends on the particular payoffs. What would happen if you fail to coordinate? What do you gain if you do coordinate? If there are multiple ways of coordinating, who gains, who loses? So there’s no single formula, but it is a lens with which to view the world simply because coordination is so ubiquitous in human affairs. Any corporation, any institution, any school, any relationship, any couple, any friendship, any family, these are all people trying to coordinate and they always have to coordinate with some signal of common knowledge. They often, in order to preserve the relationship, have to keep things out of common knowledge. So, all the phenomena of politeness, euphemism, innuendo, tact, pretending not to see the elephant in the room, beating around the bush, hypocrisy, genteel hypocrisy, all of those I consider to be cases where people privately know something, but there’s some reason to keep it out of common knowledge. The reason being something in common knowledge changes the relationship. Sometimes you don’t want to change the relationship or you don’t want to signal the wrong relationship. So, just to give a couple of examples, I mean the most common case of systematic hypocrisy is politeness. If you could pass the salt, that would be awesome. What? If you think about it, literally, it really doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. But could you pass the salt? Do you think you might pass the salt? Why do we go through those rituals? It’s because we don’t want to boss each other around. I don’t want to give you a command as if you’re the butler, assuming that we’re friends or for that matter, strangers. ADI IGNATIUS: So benign hypocrisy or some of these protocols, they may not be direct, they may not be honest, but they’re what we need to function. STEVEN PINKER: They’re what we need to preserve our relationships because our relationships are coordination games, which depend on common knowledge. Sometimes we don’t want to blow up a relationship. So, we avoid the common knowledge. ADI IGNATIUS:. Steven Pinker, thank you for being on IdeaCast. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology stock recently jumped 12% in a single week, driven by growing optimism about its custom AI accelerators and optical sensitivity chips. This performance raises a key question for investors: how does Marvell now compare to its peer, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)? NVIDIA presents superior revenue growth in key periods, enhanced profitability, and a comparatively lower valuation compared to Marvell Technology, indicating that investing in NVDA may be more advantageous. See how Marvell’s financials compare with its peers, including NVIDIA. MRVL designs and markets analog, mixed-signal, digital, and embedded integrated circuits, providing Ethernet solutions and storage controllers for HDDs and SSDs that support multiple system interfaces. NVDA supplies graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive sectors, alongside a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. See further revenue details: See further margin details: However, do these figures provide the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to determine if NVIDIA’s advantage is sustainable or if Marvell Technology still has strategies to deploy (see Buy or Sell MRVL Stock). This is one perspective on evaluating stocks. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Regardless of how appealing the numbers are, stock investing is never without its bumps. There’s risk involved that must be considered. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses and MRVL Dip Buyer Analyses to see how these stocks experienced declines and recoveries in past occurrences. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia Stock Price Levels to Watch After Chip Giant's $100 Billion Deal With OpenAI

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground in early trading Tuesday after logging their largest one-day percentage gain since July on news the AI Favorite plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. Under the deal, Nvidia will supply OpenAI with its next-generation Vera Rubin platform to help the ChatGPT maker build data centers and other AI infrastructure with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power. The companies said they anticipate finalizing the details of the partnership in the coming weeks. Nvidia shares were down 2% at around $180 in recent trading after surging nearly 4% on Monday. Through yesterday's close, the stock had gained 37% so far in 2025, handily outpacing broader market returns over the period. Investors have piled into the stock as big tech hyperscalers and sovereign customers invest heavily in the company’s products as they ramp up their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After setting their record high last month, Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle before breaking out from the pattern in Monday’s trading session. The breakout indicates a continuation of the stock’s extended move higher, with increasing volume in recent days signaling conviction from larger market participants. It’s also worth noting that the relative strength index has moved back into bullish territory, confirming strengthening price momentum. Let’s identify two potential bullish price targets to watch on Nvidia’s chart amid the potential for follow-through buying and also point out key support levels worth monitoring during future retracements. Investors can use the measured move technique, also known as the measuring principle, to forecast an initial price target if the stock climbs to a new all-time high. This works by calculating the percentage change between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest section and adding it to the pattern’s top trendline value. For example, in this case, we apply a 16% increase to $179, which projects a target of $207.64, about 13% above Monday’s closing price. To forecast a longer-term price target, investors can use bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to forecast future directional movements. When applying the technique to Nvidia’s chart, we take the stock’s trending move higher from May to August and overlay it from Monday’s breakout point. This forecasts a potential price target of around $255, implying nearly 40% upside from yesterday’s close. This prior rally accelerated after breaking out above the 200-day moving average (MA), potentially providing clues as to how a new trend higher may evolve after Monday’s decisive breakout above the 50-day MA. Investors should initially monitor the $165 level during future pullbacks. This location could provide support near a trendline that links a series of price action on the chart stretching back to early July. Finally, a larger drawdown in the stock opens the door for a retest of lower support around $150. Investors could look for buy-and-hold opportunities in this region near multiple peaks that formed on Nvidia’s chart between November last year and January this year.

Meta brought the smarts of Oakley Meta HSTN to Ray-Ban styles. Here's what's new compared to the first-gen pair. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Same looks, new features Higher-quality 3K video recording and double the battery life highlight the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 upgrades over the original model. It's available in the same Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles and prescription lenses are available within the supported range. A classic with limits Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was the breakthrough follow-up to Ray-Ban Stories, and it has sold millions. There's a reason for that — these are great smart glasses, but they also come with notable limitations, including battery life and camera quality. Ray-Ban Meta became the first product to make smart glasses mainstream, selling over two million units since their debut in 2023. Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. Meta is continuing to sell the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in. Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2. For those with advanced prescription needs, there are third-party workarounds available. Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content. The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model. I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either.

However, the video-recording capabilities of the Gen 2 pair are vastly superior to the Gen 1 model. You get 1200p at 60FPS, 1440p at 30FPS, and 3K at 30FPS video recording on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, and that exceeds the 1080p maximum on the Gen 1 glasses. It's the same 3K camera we saw on Oakley Meta HSTN, which should bring more advanced stabilization while recording video, particularly handy for action shots. Hyperlapse and slow-motion video recording is heading to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 in a future software update this fall, according to Meta. Whether you need the extra resolution and video recording features will depend on whether you're satisfied with your current Gen 1 pair. Those who love recording video while running or working out will likely benefit from the extra frame rate support and stabilization of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 camera. Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses have open-air speakers for video calls, audio playback, and more. There's also built-in microphones for audio input. Battery life was the most obvious place for Meta to upgrade its Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the second-generation model doesn't disappoint in this area. Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses. In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch. You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets. Meta AI is becoming more robust, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs. Essentially, it's a multimodal AI service that can take in audio plus your surroundings to help answer questions and take actions on your behalf. Both generations of Ray-Ban Meta support Meta AI, but there are extra features on the Gen 2 revision, like better live translation support. The ability for offline translation is also said to be coming in a future update. If you're in the market for a new pair of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, the choice is easy. The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get. You should consider whether Ray-Ban Meta Display, Oakley Meta HSTN, or Oakley Meta Vanguard might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses. However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them. The experience between models is largely the same, you'll just need to charge your Gen 1 pair more frequently. The one to buy Meta addressed the major drawbacks of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 with the second-generation revision, and they only cost a bit more. For that extra cash, you get excellent 3K video with better stabilization and double the battery life of the original. It's a no-brainer for people in the market for new smart glasses. Worth holding onto Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) are still a great set of smart glasses, so current owners might need to upgrade if the battery life is not meeting their needs. It could also be a neat value purchase if you want to save a few bucks compared to the Gen 2 version.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after major indexes hit record highs for the third straight session yesterday; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are down slightly in premarket trading after surging following news of the company's $100 billion investment in OpenAI; Micron Technology (MU) is expected to report strong earnings when it releases its financials after markets close today; Boeing (BA) shares are rising after the aircraft manufacturer signed its biggest-ever single order; and the OECD projects U.S. GDP growth will remain resilient this year but will slow in 2026 as tariffs and lower immigration weigh on the economy. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are flat after major market indexes hit record highs for the third consecutive session yesterday. Investors will be following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell today after the central bank last week made its first interest rate cut of the year. Futures tied to the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% in recent trading, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell fractionally. Gold futures hit another record high this morning, trading at around $3,820 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was up slightly at around $113,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array loans, was at 4.12% recently, down from 4.15% at yesterday's close. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus after the world’s most valuable company said yesterday it would invest up to $100 billion into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Shares of Nvidia surged on the news yesterday, gaining close to 4%, while other chipmakers also moved higher. "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said the first of those 10 gigawatts is expected to be deployed in the second half of next year. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in premarket trading. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) is set to release its earnings report after markets close today. Analysts are expecting continued strong sales from the company as the Nvidia-partner has seen strong data center sales from AI-driven demand. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect Micron's adjusted earnings per share to more than double to $2.82, while quarterly revenue is estimated to have risen 43% from the year-ago quarter to $11.12 billion. The chipmaker’s stock hit a new record high last week amid bullish analyst sentiment over the company’s AI exposure. Shares of Micron were up more than 1% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Boeing (BA) are moving higher this morning after the company announced its single largest order in history. Boeing will sell up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways, which the company said will support 35,000 jobs. In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump said the deal was worth over $8 billion deal and came after he spoke with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev earlier this month. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiations on a large order for Boeing aircraft. Boeing’s second-quarter deliveries shot past analysts' estimates as the plane maker continues its turnaround under a new CEO. Shares of Boeing, which through Monday's close had gained 20% so far this year, were up more than 2% in premarket trading. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 on the back of AI investments, but noted that tariffs and lower net immigration would lead to slowing growth next year. The OECD said it expects the U.S.'s annual real GDP growth rate to come in at 1.8% in 2025, up from from its previous projection of 1.6%. However, U.S. GDP is projected to grow by just 1.5% next year. "Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States," the Paris-based body said, but also noted that GDP growth is falling from 2024 as "strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher tariff rates and a drop in net immigration."

The article essentially confirms that. I went through this with my hip replacement because I asked my surgeon to upgrade me very shortly before my procedure to a bilateral replacement and he agreed.

This was first on deck from last night and Alastair did not disappoint. Last night Greenwald was back to soft pedal the outrage over Tucker’s speech at the Charlie Who memorial. GG holds that he didn’t say what I heard him to say. The genie is out of the bottle. Oh, Alice X, how times have changed. I remember back in the last century when I loved waking up on Wednesday mornings because that was the day that the NYT’s then food guy, “minimalist” Mark Bittman, printed (yes, PRINT) his easy, fast and delicious recipes. Now it’s Monday, when I wake up, eager, as you say, to ‘take in the day’s latest batch of fresh hell,’ and put on my headphones to listen to Alastair Crooke as I scrub down the kitchen. >Last night Greenwald was back to soft pedal the outrage over Tucker’s speech at the Charlie Who memorial. GG holds that he didn’t say what I heard him to say. The genie is out of the bottle. This bit? And it it actually reminds me of my favorite story ever. So, it’s about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people and they hate it and they just go bonkers. They hate it and they become obsessed with making him stop. This guy’s got to stop talking. We’ve got to shut this guy up. And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus thinking about what do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? We must make him stop talking. And there’s always one guy with the bright idea and I could just hear him say, “I’ve got an idea. Why don’t we just kill him? That’ll shut him up. That’ll fix the problem.” It doesn’t work that way. https://youtubetotranscript.com/transcript?v=yUwocghazRc I was amazed he went there.

HTML on the Steve Vladek link is not quite right – for readers, the post is well worth pasting into your browser. “Trump’s Bagram Folly” I think that Wukchumni called it when he said that idiotic statements like Trump wanting Bagram is just a distraction from the fact that Trump still refuses to release the Epstein files.

It’s a remarkable grove in that the highest altitude Sequoias grow there @ 9,000 feet, about 3,000 feet higher than usual, and it also sports around a dozen trees over 300 feet high, not to mention perhaps the oldest Sequoia of all-the Arm Tree, at least 3,000 years old. https://sequoiaquest.com/atwell-mill-arm-tree-tour-6212019.html There is one route in via the Paradise Trail, otherwise its all steep off-trail walking to get to the holy grail. In a dozen years of traipsing around in such a fashion with friends, we’ve never met another hiker en route off-trail, so it very much feels like your very own grove of Brobdingnagians, most of which in the higher climes are around 20 feet wide at eye level. The western edge of the grove experienced effects of the KNP Fire in 2021, with the Diamond Tree (19th biggest and 12 feet higher than the Sherman Tree) bearing the brunt of the activity, as flames raced through it’s base and carved a conflagration tunnel about 2 feet wide for 150 feet straight up, with the break-out point where the aged marquise diamond shaped fire scar that gives it the name, is. A mere mortal tree would succumb, but Sequoias can take such a beating and keep on living. Before: https://sequoiaquest.com/diamond.html After: https://sequoiaquest.com/atwell-mill-may-2022.html It’s difficult not to feel like a big nothing-a pipsqueak, in their presence. Frankly I was seriously impressed with that Hyperion tree. It’s massive. However Wikipedia says- ‘The exact location of Hyperion is nominally secret but is available via internet search. However, in July 2022, the Redwood Park superintendent closed the entire area around the tree, citing “devastation of the habitat surrounding Hyperion” caused by visitors. Its base was trampled by the overuse and as a result ferns no longer grow around the tree.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(tree) Coastal Sequoias are basketball players, and Sierra Sequoias are sumo wrestlers… Trees on the coast are in a maze of rainforest, as coastal fog supplies the wherewithal, as opposed to Sierra groves, where in a group effort, they really don’t allow much to grow in their midst and are oh so approachable. I felt as if I was killing something with every step when we were in Redwood NP. When one is in Redwood National Park on California’s north coast, it can be sobering to remember that 95% of these trees were cut down. Cities in the area have names tied to this history. Mill Valley had saw mills and Corte Madera means “cut wood”. From the perspective of the redwood forest, freedom from government regulation was hardly a positive. The Kauri tree in NZ also suffered from being a great hardwood and relatively easy to get to, and 95% of what I’d term a shorter white-bark Sequoia were cut down. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathis_australis No offense but think I prefer basketball to sumo. But all trees are magnificent. Redwoods do have more media presence–that atmospheric scene in Vertigo. If you walk out your back door to the south fork entrance and take the trail to the top of Dennison Ridge you will find a nice little grove at very close to 9000 feet. Very remote and probably seldom visited, an extension of the Garfield grove. Think I’ve been to the area you’re talking about and the Atwell Grove and Garfield Grove are kind of bookends of high altitude Giant Sequoias, one south facing and one north facing. I have only walked to Hockett Meadow once from the South Fork, as somebody has to pay the price for gaining 5,000 vertical feet. My preferred way is to backpack from Mineral King to Hockett and then walk down the Garfield Grove, where experiencing it is more pleasurable as its literally all downhill. Camping spots are at a premium on the Garfield Trail, but we stumbled onto a beauty in the upper grove, a few hundred feet off-trail hidden away, with a large circle of around a dozen boulders of size and surrounded by 20 foot wide Sequoias, with a view across of Homers Nose. It’s a dry camp, with water being about 400 feet up the trail at a creek-so mossies aren’t on ya as much. I saw written on a topo map in the Hockett Meadow ranger’s station ‘Stonehenge’ for the name of the place, and fitting. Here’s a trip report from the last time I saw the King Arthur Tree alive, a year before the Castle Fire burned it up real good. I might have been the last person to see it alive-the 9th largest living thing in the world was not an easy get. https://sequoiaquest.com/garfield-grove-919-222019.html https://sequoiaquest.com/king-arthur.html https://www.ilovetrees.net/king-arthur-dead/ I go through Mineral King to go over the gap into national forest because I don’t have to register at the ranger station and it’s a great way to access the high country by starting at 8000 feet. A great way to get to the grove I am talking about is to head south out of Hockett on the main trail and cut west across summit meadow. Continue down the ridge crest until you reach the grove. There is no trail to speak of after leaving the main trail but there is a trail out of the grove down to the south fork ranger station. Regarding the Chief Investment Officer article in AI-infrastructure investing. There is no way these numbers make any sense at all. And, if they try it will actually crowd out other investing. This is a really bad bet but all parties. Also, it means massive electricity shortages and rising power prices. Just what we need to frustrate consumers and fuel inflation. The shortest path to increasing power generation is combined cycle natural gas. If we are about to enter a period of massive construction of these plants, it seems to me we would be seeing it in the futures curve for natural gas, no? That’s because there is a waiting list of years for gas turbines. https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/052025-us-gas-fired-turbine-wait-times-as-much-as-seven-years-costs-up-sharply Why don’t they get in touch with Iran to acquire those gas turbines? “The Forever-35 Face The face-lift is better than ever, and everybody wants one.

There was some talk of renaming Naval Air Station Lemoore-where the squadron is based, to NAS Lemon, you’d only need to change a few letters. I had trouble reading that a few days ago; the graphic descriptions of how facial surgery is performed made shudder. What a horrific sounding procedure to go through. America is such a hopelessly superficial society. And perpetual facial youth is yours for $100-300K! She’s 32???? I thought she was at least 50 The H1B is framed as indians stealing American jobs, but it could also be framed as India subsidizing the US education system. Though as far as I know, nobody is doing that. Maybe our elites concluded that it’s no longer necessary for India to train American workers, as they believe that AI is going to take over all of the jobs. Really a question of extent to which H1B workers supply missing skills (the subsidize education argument) or replace skilled workers with cheaper alternatives (the stealing jobs argument). My view is that it is mostly but not entirely the latter. The former tend to be highly compensated so at least conceptually a tariff makes some sense, as companies will accept the cost to get truly missing skills, while killing the labor arbitrage of the average worker. The real ‘benefit’ of H1B’s and other guest worker visa’s isn’t necessarily that they are cheaper, but that it creates an indentured servant class that can be treated like garbage. Even in cases H1B’s cost more than an American worker, they might still be preferred by the business class because they get a workforce that’s more compliant and easier to simply discard. Ian Welsh makes that point in his latest piece on the subject: Why Trump’s 100K H-1B Visa Fee Won’t Work & How To Make It Work So, I’ve long had issues with H-1B Visas, and all types of guest-worker visas. Not only do they take jobs from natives, in many cases (but not all), they create a class of workers with limited rights. Bosses don’t just want guest workers because they are cheaper and drive down wages, but because they can be mistreated. No job, no visa, and the time to find a new one is short: sixty days in the case of H1-Bs. Even if the response isn’t to simply offshore the desired talent, the problem remains that the desired (experienced) talent may not be available in USA. Look at the fighting over AI gurus. Overlooked in all of this (I’ve yet to see a single media story mention it) is the fact that companies are still free to sponsor workers for employment-based green cards. The only drawbacks it has compared to H-1B is that it’s more expensive (not any more, with H-1Bs at $100k) and that once it’s approved, it gives the worker the same employment rights as a US citizen or resident. So all the crocodile tears about not being able to get foreign workers are just that. They can still get foreign workers, just not indentured ones. Here’s my anecdata for consideration: At my last two firms (global financial institutions), H1B workers that had attended US institutions – lower or higher education — were few and far between, other than those working in front-office, technically sophisticated areas (e.g., quant trading). That group typically had doctorates in technical fields – physics, math, etc, from the top US institutions (or, rarely, France). Of the H1Bs holding only a foreign undergrad degree a very few were pursuing graduate degrees at local colleges (e.g., Columbia, NYU) while also working. Within my department of 32, of 7 H1B workers only 2 had undergrad degrees from a US college. In 20+ years of hiring for junior staff in the finance world (in a complex but not in highly advanced area), I have generally found the H1B bachelors-holding applicants to be about equal in skills to US citizens with bachelors degrees. There’s a lot of variance in that lot, the brilliant and the morons being about equally distributed. The H1Bs are a bit less clued in to the larger American/Western culture, but I was hiring to get a finance job done, not to discuss the plot line of Emma Bovary. I think there’s a strong argument to be made that the H1B should be restricted to only advanced degree holders, working directly in their degree field – physics PhDs should not be eligible for a visa to work on finance problems, no matter that trading activity could be modeled (and exploited) by applying physics properties. It can be argued that the truly skilled quant personnel can enter under O visas like actors and musicians. I would be happy to see H1-B visas (and really any other “work” visas beyond those needed for very high level collaboration work) to go away altogether. It’s a brain drain for the labor exporter country and drives down wages for US domestic work force. And BBC literally admits that Experts say pay data shows why Trump’s new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won’t even earn enough to cover it, say experts. If these are truly the best, elite people, how is they’re getting paid an average of $94K? Like, for reals? This doesn’t pass the smell test; never has. ‘It’s a brain drain for the labor exporter country and drives down wages for US domestic work force.’ I think that might have been the plan. Much like China, it can be hard to step back and realize that it’s really the American capitalists and the Indian capitalists that are screwing their collective workers. On balance I think Indian workers probably come out a bit ahead, though. Looking at the supposedly intent of H1B, though, it is telling that the overwhelming majority of H1B holders are from India, followed by China as a distant second; It cannot really be that the world’s best and brightest reside mostly in India in such an overwhelming proportion. The program has been heartily abused as a wage suppression scheme for decades. It’s not complicated. The difference between Indian and Chinese H1-B visa holders is the English language. Indians ALL speak excellent English … better than many native Americans. Slightly different accent so many Americans insist the Indians’ English proficiency is, well … not as good (much less superior) to their own. And this simplification explains Experts say pay data shows why Trump’s new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won’t even earn enough to cover it, say experts. Superior skills would generally imply, at least in capitalist America, superior pay. It is not in evidence however. And regardless of even that, there’s been plenty of excellent investigative reporting demonstrating quite clearly how body shops game the H1B system to import workers to replace Americans. This is the overwhelming usage of the system today, as documented extensively. Young Chinese all take 9+ years of English. Many of them speak excellent colloquial English and are even better on reading and writing. I think the difference is that almost all Indian high achievers aspire to leave India for North America, Australia, or the UK. Chinese high achievers are increasingly choosing to stay in China for education and work.

Union Pacific – Norfolk Southern merger UP-NS merger ‘sounds good to me,’ Trump says Train magazine Trump met with UP Chief Executive Jim Vena last week in the Oval Office, when he first expressed support for the Omaha-based company’s acquisition of NS, headquartered in Atlanta. STB Criteria is serve the Public interest and enhance competition, huh? Looks like a rubber stamp to me. Trump met with UP Chief Executive Jim Vena last week in the Oval Office, when he first expressed support for the Omaha-based company’s acquisition of NS, headquartered in Atlanta. Trains Matthew K. Rose, who retired as BNSF Railway’s executive chairman in 2019, says the UP-NS merger would be a train wreck for President Donald Trump’s reindustrialization efforts … Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads have proposed a merger — what could possibly be wrong with a transcontinental railroad? First, there exists no financial crisis in the rail industry, like that which drove the significant consolidation in the freight rail industry over the last 30 years. The proposed merger is driven by management and a micro-minority of activist stockholders, not for the benefit of shippers, employees, or even most investors. Second, risk of merger integration and ongoing operational failures of a nationwide rail network is significant. Transcontinental railroads, given their size, are too big to run but not too big to fail. Finally, the merger puts industrial and commodity shippers at a disadvantage — the very U.S. industries that President Donald Trump is seeking to promote. Let me explain… Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) has been asset stripping for 15 years now. Employment down 33%, ripped up yards and trackage. Freight volumes have flat-lined since mid 2000s, while trucking is up 30% Railroads have a 40% margin. Wall Street and executives compensated with stock are the ONLY beneficiaries of consolidation. Customers, the public and environment are the lovers. The only positive is consolidation makes nationalization easier in the future. Railroads should be a public asset and not a plaything for billionaires. Reading Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Revolution right now which is written from a Marxist viewpoint. Apparently the US was one if the very few Western countries whose railroads were not nationalized from the get-go.

Was in Hong Kong for a coin show when Ike rolled into town, and what a performance. I was on the 17th floor of the Holiday Inn in Kowloon, part of me wanted to watch the proceedings from a window, and another part of me wanted to lay in the bathtub sans water, and lock the bathroom door-just in case. The latter strategy won out. It felt like a continual 4.1 earthquake for an hour, quite unsettling. The next day, junks were 100 yards inland along with other boatalities scattered to and fro, bamboo which was used rather exclusively for scaffolding, was shredded similar to shredded wheat, and bamboo is no shrinking violet. I’ll take earthquakes instead… I guess that when you are used to earthquakes that only last a few seconds, that it would be extremely unnerving being in a swaying tower for over an hour. Reading up on Typhoon Ike, it was a monster- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Ike Some earthquakes last over a minute, but what makes them so long is how time slooowws down the more you while in your chair dances around the floor. Those seconds feel like minutes and for those few quakes that do last minutes, I imagine that they do feel like they last hours. Also, if you’re in a serious quake zone (e.g. Sumatra) the thought that gets me is “this is minor right now, but could get really destructive”. Never felt so small. When I lived in Banda Aceh there are noticeable earthquakes every few days. After a while of this our brains kept “feeling” non-existent quakes. Ended up keeping a glass of water on the table so we could check for ripples. No fan of wind, but would take it over quakes. A glass of water on a table can give a warning about other things as well- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25udaa-Wn4E When those little orange tiger cubs grow up will they always play nice with their human hosts and handlers?

I keep on getting the impression that these countries are saying stupid stuff like this because they are absolutely convinced that Trump will ride to their rescue, even if it means triggering WW3. Since the Pentagon recently announced that they are pulling weaponry and resources out of the Baltic States, that is not a bet that I would take. > Sinclair preempts Jimmy Kimmel Live! after ABC’s decision to reinstate.

Wolfgang Munchau: The war cheerleaders need to go back to the mindset I had in the 1980’s. War in central Europe was (and is) a tripwire for nuclear war! Recall of the horrors of WW II was gone in my view. Vietnam and the limits of US power were in play! Ground Launched Cruise Missiles and Pershings (nuclear tipped all) in Europe. The war cheerleaders need to recognize the limits of US power to project against a first world power within its geography. They also need to recognize their own limits. The fact that sanctions were wrong was obvious: long term trade benefits both sides. G7 is slowing in part because they shot themselves in the feet with sanctions. Anyone with eyes and Econ 101 would see! They should all pull up Nena’s “99 Red Balloons” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpu5a0Bl8eY&list=RDFpu5a0Bl8eY&start_radio=1 Those cheerleaders could also try a little harder to explain what victory in a NATO-Russia conflict looks like to them in both the nuclear and nonnuclear cases. Anyone using the word “Putin” in the answer should explain how Russian security interests change when he’s gone or else own up that they really want something like the prostrate Yeltsin client state selling everything they can for pennies on the dollar. Extreme economic and political instability in Russia is a desirable strategic goal? You mentioned the sanctions. If the US top goal for Project Ukraine was to gather its European vassals back, domineer them, extract tribute, and sever their relations with the East then so far it looks like it has worked. Breaking up Russia is unspoken U.S./UK/Berlin/Brussels goal. Not explicitly written in print media – (because they all know to officially demand Russia´s break-up would be against international law which by design only Russians are capable of violating) – but tacitly understood by editors and readers and politicians alike. One of those lovely Bourdieu-esque cultural demoninators among elites. It is contradictory that in this article, Munchau, while correctly identifying the warmongers still buys their propaganda and the “unacceptable aggresions” by Russia and tries “not to underpin the security threat posed by Vladimir Putin”. This security threat is, in it’s entirety, a creation of the CW and expanded even more by the European warmongers themselves. It is real because it exists in the minds of those who so rabidly want war with Russia but it would dissipate as soon as the sanctions-obsessed warmongers were substituted by more rational actors with a will to restore relationships instead. Does he try, with this contradiction, not to be sidelined completely by the very same propagandist warmongers he is criticising? If so I think it is illusory for Munchau to believe that he can stand in some kind of middle way. He must be either with them in every sense or totally against them because the warmongers themselves will demand it. I think this explains what he writes his last phrase: “They leave me in no doubt that there is substantial support for a glorious war, just as there was over 100 years ago” and omits the corollary “and this support might end with the same tragic consequences”. Munchau tries, somehow cowardly, not to compromise too much.

Terrorist bon mots! “‘We’ve given up on Israel’: Disillusioned with Netanyahu and the war in Gaza, Israelis are fleeing” Maybe this lot is smarter than I figured.

As a cynical American conditioned to listen for war drums, financial stabilization is not my first thought when I see a US official use that line in reference to international affairs. Are we sure this isn’t Act II of a flanking maneuver on the southern cone as the US war machine repositions for Monroe Doctrine 2.0? Argentina is probably too far to be of any assistance with the war on Venezuela but lots of water and minerals in Argentina. I believe that many people are attending or watching memorials for Kirk with real feeling, but spontaneous and impromptu are not accurate. The well-funded bots and monied efforts on all the socials (including YouTube) and throughout the internet, never mind FOX news and bots in place to create conflict, did so much to foment the mood, along with the White House. (Although I suspect Trump is pretty steamed about now with all the admiration for Kirk.) It’s exhausting. For a while there the Kirk-bot posts outpaced “thank you, RFK, Jr!” Bots.

I’ll see you at the new site …” – ‘On Gaza & Ukraine: Canadian PM Mark Carney is either a fool or a Deep State operative’ – Lucy Komisar This is a nice critique of the type of bulls**t rhetoric coming from Western leaders these days. But I’m not sure I’d call Carney either a fool or a Deep State operative. When your Prime Minister is the former Governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, it tells me that elites don’t even have to pretend any more that you are a “democracy” of all the people. It’s as if billionaires in the US just started running for elective office directly rather than funding “regular” candidates secretly… oh wait. Oligarchs don’t have to pretend we have a democracy anymore. Nor do they have to pretend that their words have any relation to facts. It’s all just for show these days. Trudeau gets replaced by this guy. Biden gets replaced by Trump. Nothing fundamentally changes.

Premium Pumpkin Decor McSweeny’s most read article of all time: https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season (mfers) Link as posted didn’t work for me, but if you add a vulgarity to the end, you’ll get to it directly. (or main page has a link in the ‘trending’ column). Thank you! Those pumpkins are a great vegetable. Terrible waste of good food. I had to address the corn syrup vs sugar story. I quit drinking all sodas over 10 years ago due to corn syrup. I realize sugar isn’t good either, but in general avoid all products containing corn syrup. I do not eat anything with corn syrup in the product, I found it in campbells tomato soup and Italian sausage. I found it in all sorts of products and just classify it as processed food. I have found many alternatives and try to eat as organic as possible. If I do choose a soft drink, I try to stick to diet but wonder if sugar might still be a better choice than whatever chemical compound the diet soda might have in it. So all the hysteria relative to corn syrup was just nonsense? Really? Yes. With sodas, the colorings are at least as bad as the sugars. Aspartame has more complaints than any other food additive approved by the FDA by a huge margin, yet oddly RFK, Jr. is not interested in that. Coincidence? “Incidentally, the Dirty Money website shows that the company Fanjul runs with his brother Pepe, Florida Crystals, donated $1 million last year to the super-PAC known as Make America Great Again Inc. You can probably guess which grotesque presidential candidate it supported.” Florida Phoenix Many of the artificial sweeteners have been found to be cancer-causing. We switched to flavored carbonated water and like it pretty well. “I Took Bernie Into Deep Trump Country. Can He Win Them Over?” Bernie won nearly every county in Upstate NY that went for Trump. The reason why in retrospect at latest Bernie gotta seriously ask himself why he did not risk a rift in the DNC back in 2016 and 2020. I am not pink-glassed re: Bernie (in Germany he would have been a Merkel-man). But by comparison… Because he needed ballot access. The rules in many states for new parties are insanely restrictive. I understand the reason why he did not run third party, as the chances of a third-party candidate ever being successful are impossible the way that the ballot laws are intentionally-written. However, a lot of people are very bitter (Myself included) over the fact that he did not take Biden to task as he and the rest of the Democratic Party so richly deserved and instead groveled before the very establishment that was blatantly trying to cheat him and as a result, we got stuck with his “friend” Joe Biden. At the very least, he could openly point out how dishonest the leadership of the DNC is and how they are just as much of an obstacle to taking on the plutocratic oligarchy as the Republicans are. I understand that he was afraid of a Trump victory at the time, so he tried to foster “party unity” among the Democratic Party. He still got a proverbial kick in the teeth from them after doing so. The problem is that Sanders does not seem to realize that the Democratic Party as a whole, particularly the Clintonite wing is never going to forgive him no matter what he does for daring to challenge Hillary’s claim to the throne in 2016, so there is no point in trying to appease members of the Democratic nomenklatura who are going to hate him no matter what he does. He should have given them no quarter, because they certainly did not give him any. Only after you are victorious should you consider extending the proverbial olive branch. Indeed. I give him a pass for 2016 – he did make a pledge ahead of time to support the eventual nominee, and he kept it even after he got screwed. That shows integrity. But given that, when they stuck the knife in again in 2020, he should have gone scorched earth. Yeah. The part that got me was barely acknowledging the multiple efforts made to successfully sabotage both his campaigns. I get ‘16 for the same. He made a pledge, kept his word.

Shutdown theater continues: Trump says no meeting with top Democrats on shutdown ‘could possibly be productive’ President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to cancel a planned meeting this week with the two top Democrats in Congress, just days before the federal government is set to shut down. Trump had been scheduled to meet with Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries sometime this week, CNBC and other news outlets reported. “After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. This year is pretty lit. Meanwhile on Priced out of traditional housing, more Americans are living in RVs Out here, we have a ton of RVs, but these seem to be much more affluent or at least reasonably well off RV owners. They’re here for half the year, the other half elsewhere, many it appears in Florida. These aren’t the newly poor(er). PE buying up RV parks has been a big these these past 10 or 15 years. This is definitely a growth area for exploitation. I can’t get WSJ, but this is similar U.S. lawmakers push for military dialogue in a rare China visit (NPR) I pretty much take it as a given that a parked 5th wheel trailer in a driveway is never going on vacay again, thanks to somebody living full time in it. Theater, indeed … of the Japanese “Kabuki” variety. Only the lonely Thomas Massie had the integrity to point out that a CR simply restores the funding to USAID and other agencies that Musk allegedly “wood chippered” back to Biden-era levels. So, should a CR pass, expect a massive hiring spree at NGO’s and NGO adjacents, such as Business Insider, Forbes, and Politico (beneficiaries of USAID largesse.) Gotta crank out those Goebbels-style propaganda pieces … they won’t write themselves! Ukraine is winning, Gaza isn’t genocide, etc. Or maybe they will write themselves, thanks to AI. Only a fool would ever think that the GOP is in favor of spending cuts. The end result will be a few days of shutdown theater, followed by a CR and more spending than last year, as always. I assume this is all about dollar shorts and gold / silver puts. Is everything broken? 1) I ordered two identical ceiling fans from an online website. They shipped in two different packages. The first one arrived. The second one didn’t. I checked the tracking website and saw that the second package was stuck in a distribution center in Texas. I called the shipping company and they tried to trace the package. A couple of days later I received an email that the package was lost and I needed to contact the vendor. The vendor said they would ship a replacement. I specifically told the vendor that I had ordered two, received one, and it was just the one that was missing. I got an email from the vendor that the replacement was ordered, but I noticed that the vendor ordered two fans. I called the vendor and explained that I had already received one. I was told they would try to stop one from shipping, but it was probably too late. They verified that, yes, I had informed them that I only needed one replacement. I ended up getting two replacement fans from the vendor. Then a couple of days later, the shipper evidently found the “lost” package and sent it. So, I ended up with four ceiling fans. I called the vendor and they said I could ship them back if I wanted to and they would email prepaid shipping label. I never received the shipping label. I guess I will donate them to Habitat for Humanity. 2) I ordered two different “Wicked” t shirts for a family member who is a “Wicked” fan. They were sent in two different packages. The first one was what i ordered, the second one was a Harry Potter t shirt with no tags — it looked like it had been a return. I called the vendor and I was told a replacement would be sent. I specifically told them which one I had received and which one needed to be replaced. I got the shipment and ended up receiving the t shirt I already had. 3) I ordered a pair of jeans from an online retailer. The manufacturer had two labels with a smaller size than what I ordered. However, the retailer puts its own sticker on the item that indicated a different (right) size. So I ended up with the smaller (wrong) size. I give up,. Yes Amazon? No. If you itemize your deductions, be sure to also take the deduction for your fan donation :-) Are stolen items deductible? I believe he said they never sent the return UPS stickers so they are abandon items which he happens to possess. I would expect these to be deductible as he becomes the default owner. He did his diligence in trying to return them. Yup. everything is broken. Similar thing happened with a buddy, but with a large flatscreen TV. First shipment was delayed and they eventually wound up with two and the company they bought it from didn’t want the 2nd one back. This indicates to me that these companies must be operating with some substantial margins if they can be so cavalier about losing product. “This indicates to me that these companies must be operating with some substantial margins if they can be so cavalier about losing product.” I was thinking the same thing. The fan vendor told me I could just keep the two extra fans. Since I had no need for two more fans and didn’t want the hassle of selling them, I thought I would just try to return them. The two extra fans were over $300 (total, not apiece). I think some of these companies run a business with low cost of goods and higher costs for people and shipping and storage. Somehow it’s cheaper for them to abandon physical goods than to bring them back, clean them up and repackage them. We’ve had a few experiences like this where when we received lightly damaged goods (dented metal) they just sent us a new one without asking for a return of the damaged one. Quality control on soda has gone down; I’ve had more damaged or even leaking cans than I’ve ever had before, although the number I can count on a single hand. Nonetheless, I’d never seen this before in decades of addiction until post 2020. Rice cakes as well, they’re more likely to be not entirely formed. Quaker Oats never seemed to have this issue prior to 2020. They were mostly always perfectly formed. Secret Service dismantles telecom threat around UN capable of crippling cell service in NYC | CNBC Forensic analysis is still in its early stages, but agents believe nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries — used the system to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations, McCool said. Authorities have not disclosed details on the specific government or criminal groups tied to the network at this point. About a decade ago I was doing a lot of regular business travel to NYC and noticed an immediate degradion in my cell service especially with images. It was so bad I had a recurring joke with my friends that NYPD had a geofence around Manhattan to slurp up racy pictures and texts and that was why my messages would take multiple retries to send. Wonder how long this install has been in place? So nation state actors, but they aren’t blaming Russia?!!!?? Hmmm, what other nation state has shown a proclivity for using telecom devices for nefarious purposes? I wonder why authorities aren’t offering any suggestions here, normally they are very quick to assign blame whether the facts are there or not. This reminds of that story about the mysterious drones over NJ that we never got an answer to – we probably won’t here either. Hmmm, what other nation state has shown a proclivity for using telecom devices for nefarious purposes? Lol yeah also my first thought. So when they got to the part about cartels it sounded very unlikely. But I like another commenter’s suggestion down thread that it could have been used for comment swarming/consent manufacturing “China Rare Earths Issue Remains Unresolved, US Lawmaker Says” Bit unsporting of the Chinese to refuse to sell refined earths to ultimately the Pentagon so that they can be used to build weaponry to be eventually used against China. The whole thing is ironic as there is an outbreak of peace in the Pacific right now simply because at the moment the US does not have the wherewithal to militarily confront China. China would be wise to keep this as a trump card (no pun intended.) For example: “Oh, so you say you want us to stop buying Russian oil … too bad about those rare earths, Donald.” “Oh, so you say you will slap tariffs on us if we don’t buy Boeing … too bad about those rare earths, Donald.” Perhaps Bessent and Lutnick could something something blockchain the rare earths? StableGallium? re: Germany’s death wish – not fit for war, but addicted to war I am known to be part of that faction that doubts any of the war threats by EU are serious. Hadn´t RU attacked no PR office in Berlin and Brussels could have come up with a more brilliant strategy to rule and extort. For them this was gold. Again: Why put all this to danger after it was given to them on a silver plate? Allegedly so far numbers of those joining Bundeswehr have risen by 15%. After 4 years of this? That´s not much. Especially if you consider how little that is in absolute seize. Also keep in mind that Germany already had a huge standing army. So nothing of this is new. Even, to my knowledge, the planned Tomahawks 2026 are not new and thus not faster than what we had here before (the system is 40 years old). What is faster is the Russian response and in case those Dark Eagles do fly one day which they do not on a reliable scale yet. I am not trying to downplay. But I firmly believe that crunching serious economic and military numbers and challenge the war parties that would open up a revealing debate in the sense of: “Mr. Merz, do you really want war with RU? If so, then you have to do this and this and this and turn Germany into the Fourth Reich. Do what the Nazis did. And then you loose either the planet (because nobody will survive WWIII) or you loose the country´s wealth for building a useless military.” And quickly the emperor would loose his clothes. But the peace movement for lack of competence shies away. And thus unwillingly protects the status quo and its parties. It’s just the Krauts being Krauts again. Liberal democracy was the Nixon mask they hid their sneaky Nazi streak behind and it’s now been discarded as they reach the starting post for third time unlucky. As one of the many Brits who lost kin in the last century, the right side is the one Krautenburg isn’t on. I think that this is one of the most important stories posted above: EU and German government sanction German journalist for critical tweets about Chancellor Merz. It gives us the real taste of the Fourth Reich. Being generous, you are painting with quite the broad brush here. >It’s just the Krauts being Krauts again. Liberal democracy was the Nixon mask they hid their sneaky Nazi streak behind This doesn’t fit with my experience living in Germany and knowing many Germans. It anything, they are much more aware of the dangers of fascism. > As one of the many Brits who lost kin in the last century, the right side is the one Krautenburg isn’t on. As a Brit, I am consistently ashamed at the magnitude of British war crimes and colonial and post-colonial evil. I am ashamed of what we have done in recent years to Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya etc etc. We Brits have much blood on our hands, and IMO are in no position to lecture the Germans. Not to mention Mr Starmer’s continuing drift into authoritarianism. The Krauts may be aware of fascism because liberal democracy has failed and the country is getting bsck to normal, the sheep meekly following German “leaders” authoritarian Nazi flecked anti-slav leaders in Berlin and Brussels with Eastern ambitions. Now they want to stretch the Fourth Reich to Russia to steal its resources. Just business as usual. Fortunately, for the rest of us, they lack the strategic genius which gave Hitler his initial victories in Western Europe and Poland, but they’ve inherited his dumbest decision by taking on Russia at a game the Russians now plays better than any other country. As a Brit, I’m fully aware that the Brits are prepared to do a lot of dirty jobs and we did get a lot of blood on our hands defending British interests. Unfortunately, we now have leaders who seem to prefer folliowing the Krautberg agenda in the Ukraine and Israel but, hopefully, things might improve when the Labour party dumps the bootlicking Der Starmer and then proceeds to rip itself apart giving Reform and Your Party a chance to replace deadbeat Labour and the clapped out Tories and seize the opportunities offered by sterling and concentrate on developing trade relations with Russia and the other BRICS countries. Oooh my better half is a huge Sauerkraut fan. Better I keep this post secret ;-) OT p.s. on 1940 – Currently am reading military history “Blitzkrieg-Legende, Der Westfeldzug 1940” by Karl-Heinz Frieser. I recommend it. Although Frieser claims – in a real side show in this case – that Halder did an excellent job in portraying the Wehrmacht (however the Western campaign) as head of the Operational History German Section, which is however known to have manipulated history re: USSR. But Frieser does give interesting and detailed insight into how Manstein and that Sichelschnitt attack plan came together against Halder, later due to Halder, and it was risky, i.e. it could have failed. As to “genius” the jury is still out to whether or not the French on a longterm planning level did sabotage their own capabilities in the sense that most parties of the formative French elites undermined the 3rd Republic and yearned for a subordination under German-ruled EU. The fact that French air forces, army and even tanks were larger in numbers at least than German, the fact that at least in PR terms France was intended to keep peace in Europe with the largest European Armed Forces still I cannot entirely discount as pure fantasy. How can you have de Gaulle suggesting tank tactics and yet have a French subterranean HQ but no phone (Gamelin instead driving to other generals by car wasting 2 hours, sometimes 2 days.) Long story short, Blitzkrieg was as much “Blitz” as the enemy let it to be. Also – this is from US scholarship – French secret intelligence knew darn well what the Germans were up to in terms of going to war. It´s absurd to assume that they were surprised. So by a rough look none of this collapse adds together… I was thinking of the strategic value of Pervitin use by German forces invading Poland in 1939 and, in particular, by Panzer crews during the invasion of France and the Low Countries in 1940, as recounted in Ohler’s ‘Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich’. The trouble is that Pervitin use made sense when speed and alertness were key factors by seeming to effectively amplify forces in a short campaign but much less so in a drawn out slogging match with the USSR when issuing winter uniforms would have been of greater benefit. Why revert to the bigotry of former times? “Krauts” ? What disparaging racial epithet applies to you? To me? Are those epithets what we really are? Is that what you think is using your head? Maybe bertl is in need of a Jeeves… My British and Italian ancestors fought against the Germans in both world wars (the “Wop” slain at Ortona, the “Mick” made deaf in a training accident on Salisbury Plain, the “Limey” shell-shocked at Third Ypres.) They thought they were fighting for a world in which people might not be judged for what they were born as. But I suppose you’d have to be some sort of stupid Canuck to believe that, eh? Really, though, it’s not an illusion. We’re all just people: the Hun, us, everybody. So let’s cut out the crap. It’s less a disparaging racial epiphet and more a disparaging linguistic epiphet about a people drawn together by a common language. I can’t even begin to tell you what I think of the English, but we Scots are intelligent, witty, charming, great at doing our English overlord’s military dirty work, and handsome and virile and we grow great beards as well. ‘Douglas Macgregor @DougAMacgregor THREAD: The Strategic Mutual Defense Pact (SMDP) signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan on September 17th signals a seismic shift in global power dynamics. Between 2020 and 2024, more than 60 percent of China’s arms exports went to nuclear-armed Pakistan. China maintains tacit support for this alliance through its deep partnership with Pakistan while simultaneously arming Iran with critical military components.’ Looks like China is really inserting itself in the Middle east and the US/NATO cannot stop them. I think the thing that is really going to push this into overdrive is how the US not only let Israel attack Qatar but shut down their air defenses to enable it. And we will see a lot more Chinese weaponry in this region too like is happening in Iran. For the countries in the Middle east, there is a new sheriff in town. Indian rupee slides to all-time low, US visa fee hike compounds pressure Reuters ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I’ve never seen an entire country so overrun with #79bugs, and old yeller going up as the Rupee is sliding, is very much a double win for those in the middle of BRICS. From Priced out of traditional housing, more Americans are living in RVs Gotta love NBC, though, in the end, RV living is just happy and working out after all Dante, who celebrated his 12th birthday in the RV, is in no rush to leave. “Before we moved, I hate to say it, but I was just a shut-in. I was inside all the time playing in my room, playing video games, doing whatever just inside,” he said. “But now I’m a lot healthier. I’ve been outside. I’ve been running around, getting some sun.” Over the past few months, he said he’s learned how to fish and cook and gotten to spend more time with his mom and sister. “I think it’s actually better than having a big house because I’ve learned a lot of stuff this summer,” he said. “I’ve learned more in three months than I have in my whole entire 11 years of being alive.” In America, even tragedy is positive!

I am probably misreading but the focus on NATO/Baltics in EU MSM right now almost appears as a clumsy attempt to divert from the sane argument by Putin on NEW START. Because how do you manage to devalue that. Except of course “Trump is a Putin stooge” etc. But in general nukes are simply nukes. No discussing that away. And you really have to stretch to make less nukes look bad. From the “Israel warns the EU” post: So, Israel has dismissed a recent recognition of a Palestinian state by several Western countries as mere political theatre. How can this move be more than a symbolic gesture and really translate into concrete actions that advances the peace process? Seriously? The “peace process” meme is still floating around out there? How is the peace process doing these days, anyway? Seems a bit down at the heels! Will the media still be asking about it when every Palestinian has been murdered and every Israeli has fled to the Ukraine or some other new homeland? I suppose there are different varieties of peace. “where they make a desert, they call it peace” Good news, department: The rapture is scheduled for today/tomorrow: https://www.statesman.com/news/article/rapture-bible-why-christians-23-tomorrow-pastor-21060773.php So, we can expect to see some Charlie Kirk supporters disappearing?

I always liked the Church of the SubGenius take on the rapture, a.k.a. “X-Day” (nominally July 5th), when the Men from Planet X arrive on Earth: “You WILL be saved — while all those a**holes FRY!” …which kinda cuts to the chase of the deep ressentiment behind longing for the rapture. RE: Trump Declares War on Left With “Domestic Terrorist” Designation Once again, the backlash to this nonsense is eminently predictable. Won’t be long before Oath Keepers and similar conservative groups get tagged as “terrorist” organizations once President Schiff is installed. Meanwhile, I welcome Trump’s war on domestic policing because antifa are cops. That will NEVER happen. The Dems are collaborators not opposition. The Dems have already been trying to tag conservatives as regime changers. See 1/6. The Trump admin is often the funhouse mirror reflection of that other funhouse mirror. The lawfare crowd were warned about blowback. Perhaps they didn’t care because now they can say told you so. Make it stop–both.

Police violence of this sort has been around in G7and G8 countries for decades. German police in the 1980s in fact had to change their tactics (to later ramp up their violence) because camera showed too much blood during public protests and that hurt government policies. This was all happening around anti-NPP protests. With protesters fighting cops. Being attacked from helicopters. Climbing fences. And getting beaten up. Remember the summer of Paris 1967? Or Berlin 1968? Or the death of Carlo Giuliani during the Genoa protest in the summer of 2001? I did some little reporting about Arab students in Germany in the wake of the post 9/11 Patriot Act frenzy in 2002/03. Those students lost their visa, lost their university spots, lost their jobs. They were subject to police surveillance, and general racist hysteria. I am not sure today´s left sincerely remembers the atmosphere of those years towards Muslims in general. It was ghastly. A public hysteria palpable when you walked the cities. I am having issues if Chris Hedges makes his drastic comparisons while he talks about his accompanying KLA forces. Or comparing Ukraine War with Iraq War before the fact, or talking about his dreadful experience in Latin America while making assumptions about today´s sit. I am not sure on the other hand. Indeed I am not an activist. And obviously the state lashes out against those who do push the limits. After all why fear those who do not question authority? So what is above video and what are above images about others doing videos proof of? I don´t know. But as long this “exchange” and its documentation is media reality I will keep reminding that by March 1933 – 2 months after Hitler was appointed Chancellor and at the same time the rigged 1933 elections took place – which btw still did not give NSDAP a two-third majority – NSDAP 44% vs. opposition of SPD/KPD/Zentrum 44+% – 100k people were in concentration camps subject to torture and killing, worse than Guantanamo. All this just 6 months after major newspapers in Germany had been rejoicing about the end of the NSDAP which had lost many votes in the 1932 elections and was bankrupt. p.s. when did either Taibbi, Hedges or any other knowing commentator in the US – or anyone I take seriously enough to ponder over what they are writing – last mention the problem of fascism in conjunction with Ukraine??? So we look at the “authoritarian turn” at home – which is all fine and dandy – but what about e.g. this quip from last year´s NYT, Nov. 21st? “(…)Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be an instant and enormous deterrent. But such a step would be complicated and have serious implications.(…)” https://archive.is/4G56L Azov dangling nukes before our cameras? Coooool. I can literally see how Kirn, here out of his depths in contrast to his excellent insight on cultural phenomena and entertainment life, would mutter some “why not?” argument just because it fancies “something daunting.” (This is provocative of course, since I am aware Kirn is bitterly opposed to WWIII provocation. But to point out the momentary contradictions inherent in ideology posing as “opinioned society”.) I have repeatedly said that Tylenol should not be sold OTC due to liver toxicity risk Why is this kind of reasoning so rare? The acetaminophen – autism link certainly doesn’t seem strong but that doesn’t mean it’s not a dangerous drug and shouldn’t be controlled more carefully. The binary approach to just about everything in our human culture is depressing. As to the Tylenol-autism link see: Tylenol and Autism from Science Based Medicine. Spoiler alert, current scientific consensus is that there is none. Science Based Medicine also has an article regarding the efficacy of prenatal vitamins in reducing the risk of autism, as well as other aspects of the condition: Autism and Prenatal Vitamins. This is but one of many SBM articles on the topic. I do take acetaminophen sparingly, for the reasons cited by Yves, because I cannot tolerate aspirin and other anti-inflammatories. My last purchase of Tylenol consisted of bright red, very sweet tablets which seem perfectly designed for children to accidentally poison themselves. From this morning, Cache of Devices Capable of Crashing Cell Network Is Found Near U.N., NYT, archived. The lede, The Secret Service discovered more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers, which could disable cellular towers or be used to conduct surveillance. The tech gear is above my pay grade, but might this be a narrative construction center with a hundred thousand voices? Initial analysis of the data on some of the SIM cards has identified ties to at least one foreign nation, as well as links to criminals already known to U.S. law enforcement officials, including cartel members, Secret Service officials told reporters on Monday Curious. I don’t know what to make of this story. What if it turns out to be an off-the-books operation by the NSA or some other domestic spook operation? > NSA or some other domestic spook operation It smells more like manufacturing consent for action against a nation with ‘cartels’. If domestic, why announce it? Unless it’s an intra-spookdom fight. Can’t be Israel, as zero chance the SS exposes Bibi machinations. Whichever, it feels like another shoe needs to drop before it makes sense. In the past, a plucky little country in the Middle East embedded themselves in US telecom for some reason. I’m always amazed by the important links that no one seems to be interested in talking about here in the current commentariat… As to the upcoming decline in imports due to tariffs, this is how bad they’re expecting it to get: September will likely mark the beginning of more pronounced declines. In a September 17 presentation, the Port of Los Angeles director stated they expected inbound volume to drop 10% compared to the same month last year. Container bookings data supports this outlook, with bookings from China to the U.S. down 26% in the first week of September compared to the same period last year. Of course a shortages create their own inflation, so I think there’s going to be a very bleak Christmas this year. At least on the West Coast, my understanding is that it takes a couple more months for this situation to be reflected on the East Coast. As Yves alluded to, I’m hoping to see price drops locally. But given that we have a 22% import tax, that’s going to effect our government coffers as well. Just speaking for myself, I have become numbed by all the flip-flopping, TACO Tuesdays, and general can-kicking by the administration. How many of these tariffs are real, and how many “carve-outs” are there? I know that some of them are real, as the revenue coming in cannot be faked (well, let’s hope not.) I thought we’d be seeing riots at the local Home Depot over the last battery-powered leaf blower by Bastille Day. data center power usage I am more confused. All the media keeps saying data centers are driving up electrical prices. All the data I can find says about 25 gw of actual new electrical data center usage. And up to 80 gw by 2030 that appears to be the most commonly agreed on going forward. The US actual capacity is 1250 GW, means 2% is driving all this? Of which most is concentrated in just a few small areas? I think it’s all sloppy reporting, and the reality is that raw energy prices are going up, inflation, and tariffs for everything else. I have no love of DC or AI, but it’s not ringing true they are the reason for the large increases across the country. Gail Tverberg takes the perspective that upfront costs and amortization conflict with low demand, and income inequality is a major driver of the disparity. See the comment on turbines by windall above. It could be pricing in the future costs. Or grifting… She and Tainter are scheduled to do keynote speeches at a conference Oct 25. They both share the perspective of decreasing returns on complexity in regressing systems. Fun stuff. A follow-up: John Robb: U.S. AI data center demand is forecast to reach 123GW by 2035 (vs. just 4GW in 2024). links to: > OpenAI and NVIDIA Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 10 Gigawatts of NVIDIA Systems {note the phrase ‘gold-rush’ in the url} Even 123GW could be a real problem in the material world. Simple copper shortages are one node of the hydrakrisis. But with Intel.gov * Nvidia stake in Intel * Nvidia is the fulcrum of the inverted pyramid supporting the stock market, it sure looks like a national security socialization program. Where does grift end and borgenstat begin? I’ll look to what Stoller has to say on this. Busting trust, indeed. Adam Tooze, from Wednesday’s Links: > In practical terms the most important tension may be over electric power. Trump’s pivot against renewables makes no sense from a business or tech point of view. But rather than fundamentally obstructing the AI push its most likely impact is to raise costs at the margin. Don’t bet on the hyperscalers allowing the lack of windmills to get in their way. Picasso or Bitcoin? How art’s status is changing among the super-rich The Art Newspaper ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The name-brand art bubble has been something to behold and by far the best performing of all markets bubbly. To pick an example, Paul Cézanne’s ‘Portrait of Madame Cézanne’ fetched $34,500 in 1946, and last sold for $7.4 million this year. Nexstar says it will pre-empt Kimmel but maybe not forever.

Fed Chief Powell says stock prices appear ‘fairly highly valued’ Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values. “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” Powell probably knows how history treated Irving Fisher after Fisher’s “stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau” quote in Oct 1929 https://www.nytimes.com/1929/10/16/archives/fisher-sees-stocks-permanently-high-yale-economist-tells-purchasing.html Anathema – https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/breaking-news/article/mlb-announces-automated-ball-strike-system-challenges-for-2026-season-180216779.html I won’t get into all the reasons why this is just wrong, wrong, wrong (check the definition of the strike zone in the MLB rule book for starters), but I did want to highlight this bit – “Rejoice, MLB fans, robot umpires are almost here … well, kind of.” The fact that this author thinks real fans should rejoice about robots taking over says a lot. Clearly a lot of people would rather live in the Matrix than actually deal with reality. And clearly a lot of people are really stupid if they believe a robot designed by humans is going to be infallible. But as we’ve seen with polls about “AI”, the less people know about how it works, the more they trust its results. And I’m already fantasizing about MLB players going ‘office space’ on robot umpires. From last night, heh heh, Moldova’s election faces AI-driven disinformation from Russia, AP. That’s quite a headline. I’m beginning to understand why every oligarch needs a data center. Unsurprisingly, lots of “Russia, Russia, Russia!” with the usual “attributed” and “alleged”, Tidbits, Moldovan authorities have long warned that Russia is conducting a hybrid war — meddling in elections, disinformation campaigns, illicitly funding pro-Russian parties — to try to derail the country’s path toward EU membership. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in Moldova. Spoof websites impersonate legitimate Western media and pay “engagement farms” in Africa, while AI bots are deployed to flood comment sections deriding PAS and the EU. The obligatory clampdown, Police on Monday arrested 74 people in 250 raids as part of an investigation into an alleged Russia-backed plan to incite mass riots and destabilize the country. Anschluss in plain sight for Moldova. Brown shirt organisations springing up wherever you look. Just waiting for the uniformed groups marching around cities to intimidate everyone not sharing their views, although the marching seems to done on digital media nowadays. You don’t have to be a historian to see what is coming, plan accordingly. Trade being 60% of world GDP nowadays the economic dislocations about to occur will be off the charts. I take offense with the word Anschluss describing a potential reunification of R of Moldova with Romania. It would be the third one and hopefully luckyer. There are twice the number of “Moldovans” (ethnic Romanians from the historical principality of Moldova that united with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania) in Romania than in R of Moldova and they are truly indistinguishable. We havwe the reality of divided Koreas due to the US and the reality of divided Romanians due to USSR/Russia. Of course, Brussels hates nationalism with passion, so the idea of national reunification is not in item to discus. I have been sucked into the YouTube rabbit hole in recent weeks. (I admit to avoiding politics and news as of late.) Among my suggested channels of interest are cruises, crochet and…wait for it…RV and stealth van living. I fully admit to finding the videos of how to live in one’s car, van, or modified box truck to be fascinating. And the levels at which it is being done are pretty wide ranging. Real RVs do appear to be the choice of the well off, with a few exceptions. Car living seems to be largely lower income or early in the career, with a few better off who just find it fascinating and do it part time for the challenge of both setting up a system especially for bad weather. The stealth step vans and box trucks appears to have the widest range of financial state. And those often have the most telling statements about the ability to do this. They are the ones who don’t want to or can’t afford to live in the increasingly private equity owned RV parks. And they point out that their options for being to park the vehicle are tightening and are much harder to find, both because there are so many people doing it and it freaks the businesses and people who live in the neighborhoods where they used to be able park out. This isn’t to say that the WSJ is wrong or right. Just that this anecdotal evidence is indicating that there is an increase and a response so the noose is tightening and that this is yet another alternative housing option which the traditionally homeless may not have access to much longer. I met an Ozzie years ago RVing across USA who hated it, and us. He said he couldn’t park for the night anywhere in America without someone rapping on his window, banging on the windshield, demanding to know what’s the big idea, parking here? Nothing remotely like it had ever happened in Oz. Are Americans psycho? Or are there just 20 times as many of us? I say both. re: Taibbi on Kimmel/Berenson As Jimmy Kimmel Becomes a Speech Icon, Alex Berenson Fights on Alone An imperious talk show host won the love of Hollywood and the ACLU, but to stop government pressure on companies, speech defenders need to recognize Alex Berenson https://www.racket.news/p/as-jimmy-kimmel-becomes-a-speech “Not that it matters, but while Kimmel was threatened for inaccuracy, Berenson’s problems stemmed from being too accurate about the mRNA Covid vaccines, about everything from studies showing surprising inefficacy to potential links to myocarditis that even Biden’s CDC eventually acknowledged. Critics have gone after other Berenson statements, but the ones that got him in trouble were exactly what the Founders had in mind when they thought about speech: true statements made in opposition to an official propaganda campaign. The last straw was this accurate tweet from August 28, 2021: It doesn’t stop infection. Or transmission. Don’t think of it as a vaccine. Think of it—at best—as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed IN ADVANCE OF ILLNESS. And we want to mandate it? Insanity. Berenson’s removal marked the end of a five-month campaign that involved current and former high-level officials from Pfizer and multiple government agencies. Onetime Biden official Andy Slavitt commemorated Berenson’s silencing by posting a screenshot of Berenson’s locked account. That tweet is still live:” Does anybody know, or can explain what is meant by ” (resilc) ” used in these links? I’ve never been able to figure it out It’s a “hat tip” to the submitter of the links, giving credit. It’s my impression that parentheticals following links are hat tips to contributors. Trump really does own Ukraine General Assembly Updates: After Meeting With Zelensky at U.N., Trump Shifts Stance on Russia High as a kite man President Trump said Ukraine might be able to reclaim all its lost territory in the war against Russia. Earlier, he suggested NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft that enter their airspace. Trump believes everything that Kellogg tells him – who gets all his information straight from Zelensky. So we are well past the point where it was Biden’s war and now it is Trump’s war. He now owns it lock, stock & barrel and if the Ukraine collapses, the Neocons and the main stream media will put the blame all on him. Trump’s UN speech excerpts 1) I ended seven wars. And in all cases, they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda. A vicious violent war that was Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia and Armenia and Azerbaijan. 2) These are the two things I got from the United Nations. A bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. Thank you very much. And by the way, it’s working now. Just went on. Thank you. I think I should just do it the other way. It’s easier. Thank you very much. I didn’t think of it [the teleprompter] at the time because I was too busy working to save millions of lives 3) Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements. 4) What I care about is not winning prizes, it’s saving lives. 5) China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil. 6) But inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which as you know, I found out about two weeks ago and I wasn’t happy. Think of it. They’re funding the war against themselves. I can tell you that they have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russi 7) I’m announcing today that my administration will lead a international effort to enforce biological weapons convention which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust. 8) to 156) interminable ranting about green energy and immigration Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuwHEbB6uhA , https://youtubetotranscript.com/transcript?v=DuwHEbB6uhA ‘I can tell you that they have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia’ Does that include all the refined uranium that Trump is still buying from Russia? And the fertilizers? And the chemicals? Inquiring minds wish to now. These days I find it hard to listen to Trump talk as it is like listening to a man-child talk. I cannot bear to listen to any politician or news show, hence the use of transcripts. Even Trump transcripts strain my tolerance for idiocy. 7) I’m announcing today that my administration will lead a international effort to enforce biological weapons convention which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Action is happening up-and-down the LLM stack: Nvidia is making deals with Intel, OpenAI is making deals with Oracle, and Nvidia and OpenAI are making deals with each other. Nine years after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first Nvidia DGX-1 AI computer to OpenAI, the chip giant is investing up to $100 billion in the AI lab, which OpenAI will, of course, spend on Nvidia AI systems. This ouroboros of a deal certainly does feel a bit frothy, but there is a certain logic to it: Nvidia is uniquely dominant in AI thanks to the company’s multi-year investment in not just superior chips but also an entire ecosystem from networking to software, and has the cash flow and stock price befitting its position in the AI value chain. Doing a deal like this at this point in time not only secures the company’s largest customer — and rumored ASIC maker — but also gives Nvidia equity upside beyond the number of chips it can manufacture. More broadly, lots of public investors would like the chance to invest in OpenAI; I don’t think Nvidia’s public market investors are bothered to have now acquired that stake indirectly. The interconnectedness of these investments reflects the interconnectedness of the OpenAI and Nvidia stories in particular: Huang may have delivered OpenAI their first AI computer, but it was OpenAI that delivered Nvidia the catalyst for becoming the most valuable company in the world, with the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Ever since, the assumption of many in tech has been that the consumer market in particular has been OpenAI’s to lose, or perhaps more accurately, monetize; no company has ever grown faster in terms of users and revenue, and that’s before they had an advertising model! And beyond the numbers, have you used ChatGPT? It’s so useful. You can look up information, or format text, and best of all you can code! Of course there are other models like Anthropic’s Claude, which has excelled at coding in particular, but surely the sheer usefulness makes ultimate success inevitable! If a lot of those takes sound familiar, it’s because I’ve made some version of most of them; I also, perhaps relatedly, took to Twitter like a fish to water. Just imagine, an app that was the nearly perfect mixture of content I was interested in and people I wanted to hear from, and interact with. Best of all it was text: the efficiency of information acquisition was unmatched, and it was just as easy to say my piece. It took me much longer to warm up to Facebook, and, frankly, I never was much of a user; I’ve never been one to image dump episodes of my life, nor have I had much inclination to wade through others’. I wasn’t interested in party photos; I lusted after ideas and arguments, and Twitter — a view shared by much of both tech and media — was much more up my alley. Despite that personal predilection, however, and perhaps because of my background in small town Wisconsin and subsequently living abroad, I retained a strong sense of the importance of Facebook. Sure, the people who I was most interested in hearing from and interacting with may have been the types to leave their friends and family for the big city, but for most people, friends and family were the entire point of life generally, and by extension, social media specifically. To that end, I was convinced from the beginning that Facebook was going to be a huge deal, and argued so multiple times on Stratechery; social media was ultimately a matter of network effects and scale, and Facebook was clearly on the path to domination, even as much of the Twitterati were convinced the company was the next MySpace. I was similarly bullish about Instagram: no, I wasn’t one to post a lot of personal pictures, but while I personally loved text, most people liked photos. What people really liked most of all, however — and not even Facebook saw this coming — was video. TikTok grew into a behemoth with the insight that social media was only ever a stepping stone to personal entertainment, of which video was the pinnacle. There were no network effects of the sort that everyone — including regulators — assumed would lead to eternal Facebook dominance; rather, TikTok realized that Paul Krugman’s infamous dismissal of the Internet actually was somewhat right: most people actually don’t have anything to say that is particularly compelling, which means that limiting the content you see to your social network dramatically decreases the possibility you’ll be entertained every time you open your social networking app. TikTok dispensed with this artificial limitation, simply showing you compelling videos period, no matter where they came from. Of course TikTok wasn’t the first company to figure this out: YouTube was the first video platform, and from the beginning focused on building an algorithm that focused more on giving you videos you were interested in than in showing you what you claimed to want to see. YouTube, however, was and probably always has been my biggest blind spot: I’m just not a big video watcher in general, and YouTube seemed like more work than short-form video, which married the most compelling medium with the most addictive delivery method — the feed. Sure, YouTube was a great acquisition for Google — certainly in line with the charge to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” — but I — and Google’s moneymaker, Search — was much more interested in text, and pictures if I must. The truth, however, is that YouTube has long been the giant hiding in plain sight: the service is the number one streaming service in the living room — bigger than Netflix — and that’s the company’s 3rd screen after mobile and the PC, where it has no peer. More than that, YouTube is not just the center of culture, but the nurturer of it: the company just announced that it has paid out more than $100 billion to creators over the last four years; given that many creators earn more from brand deals than they do from YouTube ads, that actually understates the size of the YouTube economy. Yes, TikTok is a big deal, but TikTok stars hope to make it on YouTube, where they can actually make a living. And yet, YouTube sometimes seems like an afterthought, at least to people like me and others immersed in the text-based Internet. Last week I was in New York for YouTube’s annual “Made on YouTube” event, but the night before I couldn’t remember the name; I turned to Google, natch, and couldn’t figure it out. The reason is that talk about YouTube mostly happens on YouTube; I, and Google itself, still live in a text-based world. That is the world that was rocked by ChatGPT, especially Google. The company’s February 2023 introduction of Bard in Paris remains one of the most surreal keynotes I’ve ever watched: most of the content was rehashed, the presenters talked as if they were seeing their slides for the first time, and one of the demos of a phone-based feature neglected to remember to have a phone on hand. This was a company facing a frontal assault on their most obvious and profitable area of dominance — text-based information retrieval — and they were completely flat-footed. Google has, in the intervening years, made tremendous strides to come back, including dumping the Bard name in favor of Gemini, itself based on vastly improved underlying models. I’m also impressed by how the company has incorporated AI into search; not only are AI Overviews generally useful, they’re also incredibly fast, and as a bonus have the links I sometimes prefer already at hand. Ironically, however, you could make the case that the biggest impact LLMs have had on Search is giving a federal judge an excuse to let Google continue paying its biggest would-be competitors (like Apple) to simply offer their customers Google instead. The biggest reason to be skeptical of the company’s fortunes in AI is that they had the most to lose; the company is doing an excellent job of minimizing the losses. What I would submit, however, is that Google’s most important and most compelling AI announcements actually don’t have anything to do with Search, at least not yet. These announcements start, as you might expect, with Google’s Deep Mind Research Lab; where they hit the real world, however, is on YouTube — and that, like the user-generated streaming service, is a really big deal. A perfect example of the DeepMind-to-YouTube pipeline was last week’s announcement of Veo 3-based features for making YouTube Shorts. From the company’s blog post: We’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone. This initial launch will allow you to not only generate videos, but also use one video to animate another (or a photo), stylize your video with a single touch, and add objects. You can also create an entire video — complete with voiceover — from a collection of clips, or convert speech to song. All of these features are a bit silly, but, well, that’s often where genius — or at least virality — comes from. Critics, of course, will label this an AI slop machine, and they’ll be right! The vast majority of content created by these tools will be boring and unwatched. That, however, is already the case with YouTube: the service sees 500 hours of content uploaded every minute, and most of that content isn’t interesting to anyone; the magic of YouTube, however, is the algorithm that finds out what is actually compelling and spreads it to an audience that wants exactly that. To put it another way, for YouTube AI slop is a strategy credit: given that the service has already mastered organizing overwhelming amounts of content and only surfacing what is good, it, more than anyone else, can handle exponentially more content which, through the sheer force of numbers, will result in an absolute increase of content that is actually compelling. That’s not the only strategy credit YouTube has; while the cost of producing AI-generated video will likely be lower than the cost of producing human-generated video, at least in the long run, the latter’s costs are not borne by TikTok or Meta (Facebook and Instagram are basically video platforms at this point). Rather, the brilliance of the user-generated content model is that creators post their content for free! This, however, means that AI-generated video is actually more expensive, at least if it’s made on TikTok or Meta’s servers. YouTube, however, pays its creators, which means that for the service AI-generated video actually has the potential to lower costs in the long run, increasing the incentive to leverage DeepMind’s industry-leading models. In short, while everyone immediately saw how AI could be disruptive to Search, AI is very much a sustaining innovation for YouTube: it increases the amount of compelling content in absolute terms, and it does so with better margins, at least in the long run. Here’s the million billion trillion dollar question: what is going to matter more in the long run, text or video? Sure, Google would like to dominate everything, but if it had to choose, is it better to dominate video or dominate text? The history of social networking that I documented above suggests that video is, in the long run, much more compelling to many more people. To put it another way, the things that people in tech and media are interested in has not historically been aligned with what actually makes for the largest service or makes the most money: people like me, or those reading me, care about text and ideas; the services that matter specialize in videos and entertainment, and to the extent that AI matters for the latter YouTube is primed to be the biggest winner, even as the same people who couldn’t understand why Twitter didn’t measure up to Facebook go ga-ga over text generation and coding capabilities. The potential impact of AI on YouTube’s fortunes isn’t just about AI-created videos; rather, the most important announcement of last week’s event was the first indicator that AI can massively increase the monetization potential of every video on the streaming service. You might have missed the announcement, because YouTube underplayed it; from their event blog post: We’re adding updates to brand deals and Shopping to make brand collaborations easier than ever. We’re accelerating these deals through a new initiative and new product features to make sure those partnerships succeed – like the ability to add a link to a brand’s site in Shorts. And YouTube Shopping is expanding to more markets and merchants and getting help from AI to make tagging easier. It’s just half a sentence — “getting help from AI to make tagging easier” — but the implications of those eight words are profound; here’s how YouTube explained the feature: We know tagging products can be time-consuming, so to make the experience better for creators, we’re leaning on an AI-powered system to identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time, capturing viewer interest when it’s highest. We’ll also begin testing the ability to automatically identify and tag all eligible products mentioned in your video later this year. The creator who demonstrated the feature — that right there is a great example of how YouTube is a different world than the one I and other people in the media inhabit — was very enthusiastic about the reduction in hassle and time-savings that would come from using AI to do a menial task like tagging sponsored products; that sounds like AI at its best, freeing up creative people to do what they do best. There’s no reason, however, why auto-tagging can’t become something much greater; in fact, I already explained the implications of this exact technology in explaining why AI made me bullish on Meta: This leads to a third medium-term AI-derived benefit that Meta will enjoy: at some point ads will be indistinguishable from content. You can already see the outlines of that given I’ve discussed both generative ads and generative content; they’re the same thing! That image that is personalized to you just might happen to include a sweater or a belt that Meta knows you probably want; simply click-to-buy. It’s not just generative content, though: AI can figure out what is in other content, including authentic photos and videos. Suddenly every item in that influencer photo can be labeled and linked — provided the supplier bought into the black box, of course — making not just every piece of generative AI a potential ad, but every piece of content period. The market implications of this are profound. One of the oddities of analyzing digital ad platforms is that some of the most important indicators are counterintuitive; I wrote this spring: The most optimistic time for Meta’s advertising business is, counter-intuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that impressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term revenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of its competitors; it’s also notable that this is the point when previous investor freak-outs have happened. When I wrote that I was, as I noted in the introduction, feeling more cautious about Meta’s business, given that Reels is built out and the inventory opportunities of Meta AI were not immediately obvious. I realize now, though, that I was distracted by Meta AI: the real impact of AI is to make everything inventory, which is to say that the price-per-ad on Meta will approach $0 for basically forever. Would-be competitors are finding it difficult enough to compete with Meta’s userbase and resources in a probabilisitic world; to do so with basically zero price umbrella seems all-but-impossible. This analysis was spot-on; I just pointed it at the wrong company. This opportunity to leverage AI to make basically every pixel monetizable absolutely exists for Meta; Meta, however, has to actually develop the models and infrastructure to do it at scale. Google is already there; it was the company universally decried for being slow-moving that announced the first version of this feature last week. I can’t overstate what a massive opportunity this is: every item in every YouTube video is well on its way to being a monetizable surface. Yes, that may sound dystopian when I put it so baldly, but if you think about it you can see the benefits; I’ve been watching a lot of home improvement videos lately, and it sure would be useful to be able to not just identify but helpfully have a link to buy a lot of the equipment I see, much of which is basically in the background because it’s not the point of the video. It won’t be long until YouTube has that inventory, which it could surface with an affiliate fee link, or make biddable for companies who want to reach primed customers. More generally, you can actually envision Google pulling this off: the company may have gotten off to a horrible start in the chatbot era, but the company has pulled itself together and is increasingly bringing its model and infrastructure leadership to bear, even as Meta has had to completely overhaul their AI approach after hitting a wall. I’m sure CEO Mark Zuckerberg will figure it out, but Google — surprise! — is the company actually shipping. Or, rather, YouTube is. Close readers of Stratechery have been observing — and probably, deservedly, smirking — at this most unexpected evolution: I am enjoying @benthompson’s journey to becoming a $GOOGL bull pic.twitter.com/xryDBIukRW That quote is from Paradigm Shifts and the Winner’s Curse, an Article that was mostly about my concerns about Apple and Amazon, and reads: And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms. Appreciating the benefits of Google being an amorphous blob where no one knows what is going on, least of all leadership, is a big part of my evolution; this Article is the second part: that blob ultimately needs a way to manifest the technology it manages to come up with, and if you were to distill my worries about Google in the age of AI it would be to wonder how the company could become an answer machine — which Page and Brin always wanted — when it risked losing the massive economic benefits that came from empowering users to choose the winners of auctions Google conducted for advertisers. That, however, is ultimately the text-based world, and there’s a case to be made that, in the long run, it simply won’t matter as much as the world of video. Again, the company is doing better with Search than I expected, and I’ve always been bullish about the impact of AI on the company’s cloud business; the piece I’ve missed, however, is that Google already has the tip of the spear for its AI excellence to actually go supernova: YouTube, the hidden giant in plain sight, a business that is simultaneously unfathomably large, and also just getting started.

Title: Uber Stock To $200?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) has experienced significant growth recently thanks to its primary ridesharing, delivery, and freight sectors capitalizing on recovering demand, as well as a renewed focus on improving margins and returning value to shareholders. With gross bookings rising 17-18% year over year in the recent quarters, and a strong increase in adjusted EBITDA, investors are questioning whether Uber could significantly outperform at its current valuation. Is it possible for the stock to double, or at the very least, provide substantial upside? Let’s delve into the thesis. However, for those seeking upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, refer to – Is Klarna stock worth the premium? At its present valuation, Uber seems to be trading with relatively moderate expectations factored in. Its revenue base is already substantial—approximately $43.9 billion in 2024, reflecting an 18% increase year over year, and if it can maintain 18% annual growth, revenues could approach $70 billion by 2027; with margins improving to 12–15%, net income could rise to $6–10 billion compared to the current $3 billion. At the moment, Uber is valued near a $200 billion market cap, but if it were to achieve higher profitability and a more favorable 25–40× P/E ratio in line with its competitors, the company could be justified at a $350–400 billion valuation within three years. This calculation translates to a share price of around $200, or nearly double today’s $99, provided that Uber meets its growth and margin expansion goals. Several factors could assist Uber in realizing that upside: Uber currently appears to be a more mature, cash-flow positive growth business, rather than a constantly loss-making startup. At $99 per share (EV/Revenue 4.3-4.8x, P/E in the 15-20× range depending on predictions), the market has already started incorporating many positive expectations. Nonetheless, there remains ample opportunity for upside if Uber can succeed in expanding its margins, maintaining consistent revenue growth, and providing returns to shareholders. Under a realistic scenario of solid medium-term growth alongside improved profitability, the stock could potentially double from current levels—particularly if multiples shift upwards. For investors who believe that Uber can preserve its scale advantages, manage costs effectively, and execute its diversified strategy, it presents a compelling asymmetric opportunity. However, the execution will be crucial—and there is considerable downside risk if growth slows or margins fail to meet expectations. Investors must brace for significant volatility and the possibility of considerable losses if market conditions worsen or if the company does not accomplish its ambitious growth objectives. While the potential for a 2x upside is mathematically viable based on projected revenues, it necessitates flawless execution in a rapidly shifting and competitive environment. Now, we implement a risk assessment methodology while developing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, comprising a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the prior 4-year period. What’s the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ASML Stock: An Overlooked AI Play?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse recognized as one of the most crucial firms in the semiconductor ecosystem, has witnessed its stock rise almost 25% in the last month, bouncing back from a decline in July following its Q2 earnings report, which sparked worries about demand for 2026. ASML’s significance lies in its distinctive function: it manufactures the machines that enable the production of the world's most advanced chips, making it essential to the entire semiconductor value chain. With the stock gaining momentum, is now the right time to invest? To provide context, here’s what ASML specializes in. ASML produces the most advanced manufacturing tools in the semiconductor sector, and arguably, the entire world. Its standout product is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These devices utilize ultra-short light wavelengths to engrave fine circuit patterns on silicon wafers, facilitating the manufacture of the leading-edge chips of 5 nanometers and below. Put simply, without ASML, the processors that power AI data centers, smartphones, and even contemporary vehicles would not be possible. Thus, ASML stands out as a unique enterprise. EUV technology plays a vital role in prolonging Moore’s Law, a long-held industry trend whereby transistor density doubles roughly every two years, enabling chipmakers to keep pushing the boundaries of computing capabilities and cost efficiency. See AVGO Stock vs. NVDA & INTC Multiple factors have shifted sentiment to be more favorable for ASML recently. To start, U.S. tariffs on semiconductor equipment, which include ASML’s lithography machines, were avoided thanks to a U.S.-EU trade agreement that exempts semiconductor production equipment from tariffs. This alleviated a significant worry for ASML's stock. Regarding demand, investment in AI remains robust. Major players like Nvidia and Broadcom are experiencing substantial growth as the increase in training and executing intricate models drives demand for high-performance semiconductors—the very kind ASML’s machines enable to manufacture. Indeed, the company reports that many of its largest customers are already increasing their EUV capacity to match the escalating need for AI chips. To illustrate the scale of these investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) indicated a potential cumulative capital expenditure of $364 billion for their respective current fiscal years. Much of this could translate into heightened demand for ASML. Importantly, ASML’s largest client, TSMC, reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue through August 2025. This impressive revenue growth is attributed to advanced nodes such as 3nm and 5nm, with the scaling up of 2nm chips expected to further stimulate demand for ASML’s EUV machinery. ASML stock is currently trading at 36x projected FY2025 earnings, which is slightly high, but there are positive signs for the stock. According to consensus estimates, ASML’s revenues are set to increase by a robust 14% this year. During the past quarter, ASML recorded net bookings of 5.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion), approximately 25% above expectations, and a historic backlog of 33 billion euros ($38 billion). With lead times of 12 to 18 months for most of its offerings, current orders should accurately reflect customer confidence well into 2026, suggesting favorable prospects for future revenue growth. Additionally, the company’s dominant market position, cutting-edge and proprietary technology, and its connection to the generative AI trend could also render the stock appealing. Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating impressive returns for investors. Separately, if you seek potential upside with less volatility than individual stocks like ASML, you might consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they’ve exhibited a smoother trajectory, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 3 Mistakes Smart People Make Investing In AI Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/22/3-mistakes-smart-people-make-investing-in-ai-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T22:14:07Z

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the strongest trends on Wall Street in 2025. I began trading in the 1990’s and the AI trend reminds me of the early stages of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s (in excitement, hype, and lofty expectations). When we look back in history the creation of the internet will likely go down with the same impact as fire, the wheel, or the printing press. Now, investors are wondering will AI have the same impact? The short answer is, only time will tell. In the rush to find the next big monster stock, many investors are repeating old patterns that have historically ended with disappointment. The AI revolution is real, but investing successfully in it requires discipline, patience, proper risk management, and rational analysis. Remember, most dot com stocks are not around today. The same is true for other major technological disruptions like the airlines, railroads, and countless other examples. Here are three common mistakes I see smart people making when they invest in AI stocks. Mistake 1: Chasing Hype Without FundamentalsThe allure of the next big winner is extremely powerful and that causes many smart people to make emotional, not rational, decisions with their money. One common emotional mistake I see people make time and time again is thinking this time might be different and they jump in, after a big move up, and chase a big winning stock. The solution here is to have a plan, respect risk, and remember, this time is not different. After you buy a stock, it can only do one of three things, go up, down, or sideways. It doesn’t matter if it is an AI stock, gold stock, or railroad. All stocks go up, down, or sideways. Even great companies that are around today that survived the dot com boom and bust, had huge swings in their prices and those swings would knock out most investors. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype and excitement. It happens to most people but respecting risk, focusing on fundamentals, and making rational decisions are keys to long-term success in the market. It is also important to note that AI is full of visionaries, bold promises, and captivating stories. It’s easy to be pulled in by exciting headlines about startups developing new AI models, or tech giants unveiling massive investments in training computers to think “like humans.” Just like in the dot-com boom, the stories feel groundbreaking. The problem? Many companies riding the AI hype lose money. Some are even startups with barely any revenue. The same was true during the dot com boom and subsquent bust. Typically, what happens is investors pile in hoping to capture outsized returns, but they often end up buying into businesses that can’t support their lofty valuations and ultimately lose money when the stock falls. The history lesson: dot-com déjà vuIn 1999, companies with “.com” in their names raised billions, even when they had no plan to generate lasting cash flow. When the bubble burst, most collapsed. A similar pattern can’t be ruled out for AI. While some winners will emerge and dominate, many current players may fade into irrelevance or bankruptcy. What fundamentals still matter in AIA lesson often forgotten during speculative booms is that traditional financial metrics matter. Cash flow, balance sheet strength, and proven demand should anchor investment decisions. For chipmakers like NVIDIA that already generate substantial profits, the AI boom supports a strong existing foundation. But for early-stage firms, the risks can outweigh the potential if investors ignore fundamentals. Investor takeaway: Always separate visionary storytelling from hard financial data. A revolutionary technology is not a guarantee of revolutionary profits. Mistake 2: Overconcentration in One or Two Big NamesThe temptation to “go all in” is real and is another common mistake I see very smart people make in various market cycles. NVIDIA’s meteoric rise has transformed it into one of the best-performing stocks of the decade, largely due to AI. Its chips are essential for training AI models, and its revenue has exploded as demand for data center hardware soars. For many investors, the temptation is to put a disproportionate share of their portfolio into one strong idea. The temptation is there for just about any stock, it especially when the stock is going up. The same happened in past cycles. During the dot com boom, names like Intel, Cisco, Qualcomm, and Microsoft raced higher. During the smartphone revolution, it was Apple. Those who bet heavily on a single titan enjoyed enormous returns—but timing and risk management matter. Investors who bought those names at their peak lost a lot of money during the dot com crash. Investor takeaway: AI is bigger than one or two companies. Proper risk management and proper diversification across the value chain can help reduce risk while maintaining upside potential as long as AI stocks remain in favor. Mistake 3: Ignoring Cycles and ValuationsThe myth of endless growth and this time is different are very powerful.Boom cycles make it feel like the good times will never end. In 2023 and 2024, AI fueled explosive stock runs, with market leaders adding billions to their market caps in months. The narrative was simple: AI will reshape everything, and therefore valuations don’t matter. That mindset is very dangerous. No matter how transformative a technology, growth slows and expectations reset. Even industry titans experience profit cycles, regulatory pressures, and increased competition. Assuming AI leaders will post quarter after quarter of uninterrupted growth ignores how markets function. Why valuation discipline matters in AIWhen investors pay 100-400+ times earnings, they are essentially betting that hypergrowth will continue for years without fail. That leaves no margin of safety. If growth merely slows rather than collapses, stocks priced for perfection can still fall by double digits. Tesla, for example, soared on future-oriented narratives about electrification. Yet periods of slower sales or increased competition triggered sharp corrections in the stock, even though the long-term thesis hasn’t disappeared. AI stocks face the same risk: growing markets, but volatile share prices. Liquidity, rates, and market sentimentAnother overlooked factor is the broader economic cycle. AI companies thrive in markets with plentiful liquidity, like when interest rates are low and growth capital is abundant. Markets and the economy move in cycles. Investors who ignore this reality may get caught in market downturns that can be far more brutal than expected. Investor takeaway: Even the best AI stocks can tumble if valuations get too stretched. A disciplined entry point, and strong respect for risk, matters as much as believing in the long-term story. Putting It All Together: An Investor PlaybookAI is unlike any other technological wave because of its scope, touching everything from healthcare and finance to defense and entertainment. Yet human behavior in markets has not changed, and the same investor mistakes recur. To avoid missteps, investors can build a playbook: Prioritize fundamentals: Separate hype from balance sheet strength. Profitable companies with durable moats offer safer long-term prospects. Diversify exposure: History has taught me that it is usually a good idea not to put all your money in one “hot” stock. Respect cycles: Recognize AI leaders can endure corrections when valuations run too hot—patience, timing, and risk managemnet always matter. Stay adaptive: The winners today may not be winners tomorrow. New stocks come all the time and shifts in regulation can disrupt even dominant players. Measure conviction against risk: Ask whether your excitement is based on headlines—or on sustainable advantages. Conclusion: Riding the AI Wave WiselyInvestors are right to be excited about AI. It will likely be as transformative as the internet, smartphones, or electrification. But the stock market has a way of turning great technologies into poor investments when enthusiasm divorces from discipline. The good news: by avoiding these three mistakes—chasing hype without fundamentals, overconcentrating in one name, and ignoring valuation cycles—investors can improve their odds of capturing long-term gains without succumbing to short-term pain. There is a very strong chance that over time, AI will create trillion-dollar companies. It will also produce plenty of losers. The key is remembering that markets ultimately reward patient, rational investors who separate stories from substance.

Title: Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs

Seoul, South Korea, September 22nd, 2025, Chainwire Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs Partnership set to bring programmable assets to Korea’s $450b crypto market, the world’s second largest by trading volume Seoul Exchange and Story Protocol have entered into an agreement to build Korea’s first dedicated blockchain exchange for tokenized cultural and intellectual property assets. The collaboration outlines how Seoul Exchange will launch a regulated RWA trading platform powered entirely by Story’s blockchain infrastructure for the next 3 years. Seoul Exchange is a fintech company that provides brokerage services for unlisted stocks of startups and venture companies through its unlisted securities trading platform “Seoul Exchange.” It is one of only two platforms officially selected by the Korean government to operate under the financial regulatory sandbox. Seoul Exchange has received investment from leading Korean and global VCs such as Hashed, SoftBank Ventures, Capstone Partners, and POSCO Technology Investment. Under the agreement, Seoul Exchange will use Story as the sole infrastructure provider for registering and settling tokenized offerings. For an initial term 3 years, all listings on the exchange ranging from music IP and webtoons to patents and private securities, will be recorded on Story’s network, leveraging its composable architecture and native $IP token economy. IP is expected to become Korea’s leading real-world asset (RWA) category, with Story positioned as the exclusive chain for Seoul Exchange’s IP tokenization. Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. Korea is home to some of the world’s most successful creative exports, but monetizing IP remains limited to insiders. This new trading platform aims to change that. By bringing IP onchain, Story and Seoul Exchange are unlocking a new class of fractional, transparent, and globally accessible digital securities. Global IP is valued at over $80 trillion, yet most of it remains illiquid and inaccessible. This partnership aims to unlock IP and other real-world assets (RWAs) via blockchain, allowing global investors to own, trade, and earn from high-value creative works. Korean storytellers have captured the world’s imagination. Global hits like K-POP Demon Hunter became Netflix’s most-popular film of all time with 236 million views in the first nine weeks. Parasite won Best Picture at the Oscars. Squid Game became Netflix’s most-watched show. Baby Shark is a global phenomenon. But behind this success lies a structural problem: creators rarely retain ownership or share in the long-term upside. Platforms like Netflix own the IP. Studios operate on thin margins. Even as Korean content goes global, the value flows elsewhere.This imbalance has sparked growing debate in Korea, with many voices calling for a new model that allows creators to break free from reliance on upfront financing and pre-production deals. Story is introducing such an alternative through content tokenization. By enabling global fans to directly participate in fundraising, production companies can retain ownership of their IP and instead engage in distribution agreements that ensure fairer and more sustainable revenue models. This approach not only protects creators’ rights but also opens the door to a new, fan-driven economy in entertainment. The platform will combine retail accessibility with institutional-grade compliance under Korean regulations. Should a Korean won-pegged stablecoin be approved by regulators, the platform is designed to support its integration it may be integrated for native currency settlement, further aligning with domestic financial infrastructure. Tokenized content, including music rights, game universes, can be listed and traded by retail and institutional investors alike, all within Korea’s evolving STO regulatory sandbox. Story Protocol is the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for IP. It enables IP to be registered, licensed, and monetized in real time, embedding royalties and usage terms directly into the tokenized representation of creative assets. Backed by investors including a16z, Polychain, Hashed and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has already rapidly expanded its ecosystem and onboarded a diverse music collectives, DeFi protocols, and global entertainment IPs. For example, Story has already begun tokenizing major K-culture IP, including the music rights of leading K-pop artists (BTS, BLACKPINK, Psy, BIGBANG) and global artists (Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus) Seoul Exchange’s integration makes Story the de facto infrastructure for Korea’s next wave of tokenized RWAs, positioning it as the blockchain gateway for cultural capital. This partnership bridges Korea’s booming cultural industries with the world’s capital markets. The platform will prioritize assets with strong fan engagement and long-term value potential, and will also support future integrations with financial products, remix licenses, and governance layers, bringing programmability to previously static IP rights. JD Yang, CEO, Seoul Exchange: “Through this collaboration, Seoul Exchange has further strengthened the stability and trust in the process of building our STO exchange. We aim to become Korea’s leading STO exchange through a differentiated tokenization model centered on IP and content.” Seung-yoon “SY” Lee, Co-founder & CEO, Story Protocol: “We see this as a landmark step in making Korea’s world-class cultural IP accessible to global investors. Story enables creators and platforms like Seoul Exchange to go beyond traditional licensing models to build liquidity, loyalty, and monetization around programmable IP. Intellectual property is the largest untapped asset class in the world, worth over $80 trillion, and with Korea now the second-largest crypto trading market in the world, the opportunity to pioneer new asset classes is massive. This partnership brings us one step closer to unlocking that value at global scale. With this move, Story will be one of only two chains powering RWAs in Korea, the second-largest crypto market in the world, confirming IP’s place at the center of Korea’s next blockchain growth cycle.” About Story Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. The network enables creators, developers, enterprises, and AI labs to register content as on-chain assets with embedded rights, turning media, data, and AI-generated works into legally enforceable digital property. By bridging the gap between outdated legal frameworks and the realities of the AI era, Story makes it possible to track provenance, automate licensing, and unlock new markets for ideas. As the foundation for IP’s evolution into an internet-native asset class, Story powers a more open, equitable, and composable creative economy. Copyright © 2025. All Rights Reserved By Media Fuse LTD

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business

After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google’s services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company’s lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet’s ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google’s advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn’t agree with all aspects of Mehta’s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet’s stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta’s decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google’s ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta’s decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google’s lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department’s “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,” Google’s lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Shares of a semiconductor testing company rose Monday after an analyst highlighted strong demand trends and collaboration with a major chip-industry player. Meanwhile, reports of an impending product safety announcement dragged down shares of a consumer health firm. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher as plans by Nvidia (NVDA) to invest up to $100 million in ChatGPT maker OpenAI reinvigorated optimism around artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, extending its streak of all-time closing highs to three consecutive sessions. The Dow ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, with both setting their own fresh closing records. Shares of Nvidia finished 4% higher. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The day's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (TER), which surged 13%. Susquehanna Financial boosted its price target on Teradyne stock, with its analysts saying the provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors and robotic systems could benefit from strong demand trends over the coming years and highlighting Teradyne's increasing partnership with chip industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). White House officials confirmed that Oracle (ORCL) is part of a consortium set to control the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle also announced that Clay Magouyrk, current president of cloud infrastructure, and Mike Sicilia, president of industries, will take the reins of the enterprise software giant as co-CEOs. Current CEO Safra Catz will remain with Oracle as the executive vice chair of its board, while co-founder Larry Ellison will maintain his role as chief technology officer and board chair. Oracle shares jumped 6.3%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.2% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine panel voted on updated recommendations related to COVID shots. While the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices removed guidance calling for all people to be vaccinated against COVID and now recommends that patients consult with their doctor before receiving the shot, the panel opted not to require patients to obtain a prescription for the vaccine. Shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB), a provider of equipment for freight and passenger railway systems, added 4.9%. The company also known as Wabtec announced a deal worth more than $4 billion to deliver 300 of its Evolution Series locomotives to Kazakhstan's national railway company over the coming decade and provide long-term service support. Citi analysts initiated coverage on Wabco stock with a "buy" rating, suggesting the company could benefit from increasing infrastructure investment as well as moves by railroad operators to renew and expand their fleets. Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%. Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

September 22, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, delivered two Explorer-class spacecraft to Kennedy Space Flight Center for NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory. Last year Rocket Lab completed the design, build, integration, and testing of the twin spacecraft, named Blue and Gold, in just three and a half years, an accelerated timeline for a Mars mission. This achievement was made possible by Rocket Lab’s mature spacecraft manufacturing experience and its vertically integrated supply chain, which brings production of critical components like solar arrays, star trackers, propellant tanks, reaction wheels, radios, flight software, and more, in-house. ESCAPADE is based on Rocket Lab’s Explorer spacecraft platform, a configurable, high delta-V interplanetary variant of the Company’s advanced family of spacecraft. ESCAPADE is part of NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, designed to deliver high-value planetary science at lower cost and on faster timelines. ESCAPADE will deliver critical Mars science at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional billion-dollar missions. During a 22-month cruise to Mars, Blue and Gold will travel together before entering complementary elliptical orbits around the planet to conduct their science campaigns. The spacecraft will simultaneously capture data from two regions of Mars’ magnetosphere. This unique two-point measurement will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips atoms from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “ESCAPADE is a perfect example of why Rocket Lab exists – to make ambitious space science faster and more affordable. Delivering two interplanetary spacecraft on schedule and within budget for a Mars mission is no small feat, and it speaks to the determination and agility of our team. They’ve proven that we can take a concept from design to Mars readiness in just a few short years. This won’t be Rocket Lab’s last time at Mars, with concepts like the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter on the horizon, we’re laying the groundwork for more complex, capable, and essential missions that will support future human exploration.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: “It's been a long road, but we are so excited to be launching Blue & Gold on their mission to understand the Martian space weather environment. Through the usual ups and downs, Rocket Lab has been right alongside NASA and UC Berkeley, supporting us every step of the way on this interplanetary journey." Upon arrival at Kennedy Space Center, Rocket Lab engineers will conduct post-transport inspections and functional tests in the cleanroom before propellant loading and vehicle integration. Launch is scheduled to occur no earlier than this fall on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. + Rocket Lab Media ContactLindsay McLaurinmedia@rocketlabusa.com + About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads, and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech,” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile. Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm. The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about 50 million daily active users, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users. AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like Sitch have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features. Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a partnership with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the financial struggles of Match Group, which has lost about 68% of its stock price in the last five years. So far, this investment has produced features like an AI photo selector tool for Tinder, which scans your camera roll to help choose profile images, as well as AI-powered matching. Hinge has a feature that lets users improve their responses to profile prompts with AI. Bumble has added similar AI features, and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd even ruffled some feathers last year when she suggested that one day, users could have personal “AI concierges” that go on dates with other people’s AI to determine compatibility.

September 22, 2025 15:52 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168441&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Title: Google enters second court battle against DOJ over alleged monopoly

Watch CBS News September 22, 2025 / 12:44 PM EDT / AP After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a "remedy" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would "invite disruption and damage" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its "Ad Manager" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling. The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's "radical" proposals. The Justice Department is "fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed," Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google’s services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company’s lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet’s ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google’s advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn’t agree with all aspects of Mehta’s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet’s stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta’s decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google’s ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta’s decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google’s lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department’s “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,” Google’s lawyers argued leading up to the trial.

Title: Microsoft reacts to President Trump's shocking $100K H-1B visa fee — "creating anxiety and uncertainty"

Time Published: 2025-09-22T14:05:00Z

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee announced this past weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, had a busy weekend scrambling to provide proper guidance for employees following US President Trump's announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The executive order, signed by President Trump on Friday, September 19, went into effect on Sunday, September 21. Microsoft was quick to release a memo to affected employees on Saturday explaining the situation. According to an internal memo (via Business Insider), Microsoft advised H-1B employees currently in the US to remain in place. The advisory for H-1B employees caught outside the US at the time of the proclamation is much more frenzied: If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. Although H-4 dependents weren't included in President Trump's proclamation, Microsoft also recommended that those employees remain in the US. For those with other visa statuses, including L-1 and TN, Microsoft states that the proclamation will not have any impact. Microsoft adds that it knows "these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you," and it asks "that you prioritize the recommendations above" despite the company not having "all of the answers right now." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Similar memos were released by Amazon and Google, emphasizing the importance of these H-1B visas in the tech industry that relies so heavily on skilled foreign workers. Friday's press conference, in which President Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick laid out the new plans for H-1B visas, caused a lot of confusion. At first, it seemed like the executive order would install a yearly $100,000 fee for H-1B visa employees. It also seemed like those with H1-B visas outside the US at the time the proclamation went into effect would be affected. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update on X on Saturday afternoon — well after associated memos from big tech companies went out and employees scrambled to find flights back to the US — stating that "this is NOT an annual fee" and that "those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter." To be clear:1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the…September 20, 2025 Of course, Leavitt's update comes with a Community Note pointing out that "Lutnick repeatedly said in an Oval Office briefing that this was an annual fee." The H-1B visa program was created in 1990 and was designed as a way to grant temporary worker status in the US. It does not grant residency. Since its inception, companies have used H-1B visas to fill roles with foreign workers that cannot otherwise be filled by US workers. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for workers with at least a bachelor's degree, as well as 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. The visas can be approved for three to six years. According to a White House press release explaining the proclamation: The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Up until President Trump's weekend executive order, H-1B visa costs included a $215 filing fee and a $780 sponsor fee, paid when the employer submitted a petition to the government to receive a visa. Amazon might have received the most H-1B visa applications in 2025, but Microsoft is in second place. The official White House proclamation didn't name names, but it didn't exactly obfuscate either: One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. That "one software company" approved for 5,000 H-1B visas does indeed seem to refer to Microsoft, which in 2025 experienced five months of layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July.

Title: Household resilience and its role in sustaining food security in rural Bangladesh
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0332868

Food insecurity and agriculture in South Asia, including Bangladesh, pose significant threats to the well-being and livelihoods of its people. Building adaptive capacities and resilient food systems is crucial for sustainable livelihoods. This study employs the Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II framework to construct a Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) and analyze its relationship with food security using data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2018. The study applies Exploratory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling to examine the impact of key resilience components such as Access to Basic Services, Adaptive Capacity, and Assets on household resilience. The findings reveal that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment positively influences households’ resilience capacity. However, the presence of livestock assets has a negative impact, potentially due to market volatility, climate vulnerability, and disease outbreaks. Additionally, adaptive capacity has a positive but insignificant influence on RCI, suggesting that without enhancing economic opportunities, institutional support, and inclusive development strategies, adaptive capacity could not be enough to foster resilience. However, resilient capacity enhances food security metrics such as the Food Consumption Score and Expenditure. These findings underscore the importance of policies that focus on increasing and maintaining access to basic services, promoting sustainable land management practices, and strengthening social safety nets. This study emphasizes the importance of focusing on livestock assets to ensure their sustainability by stabilizing the livestock market, improving veterinary services, and providing subsidies to reduce maintenance costs.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Food consumption is a fundamental human need, and a global concern, characterized by a surplus of food in some regions and scarcity in others. It stands as a cornerstone of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG-1 (No Hunger) [1]. Achieving food security, which ensures an end to hunger, is essential for human well-being [2]. According to the World Food Summit, food security entails access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food [3]. However, food security is a multifaceted issue intertwined with trade, politics, history, health and nutrition [4]. Countries reliant on imports are often vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market, as international trade can directly affect food accessibility and price stability [5,6]. Political instability and conflict can severely disrupt food production and distribution systems, as observed in countries like Somalia and Yemen [7]. Food systems and access continue to be shaped by historical legacies of colonialism and unequal land distribution, particularly in many developing countries [8]. Moreover, malnutrition exacerbates health vulnerabilities, while poor health undermines households’ capacity to produce or procure food, creating a cyclical relationship [9,10]. Achieving food security, therefore, requires nutrition-sensitive systems that go beyond meeting calorie needs to ensure dietary diversity and adequate nutrient intake [11,12]. Food insecurity, on the other hand, refers to limited or uncertain access to adequate and nutritious food, and the inability to obtain food in socially acceptable ways [13]. It represents a complex challenge that affects individuals and communities worldwide. Many developing countries, including Bangladesh, have recently experienced acute food insecurity. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a collaborative initiative involving governments, non-governmental organizations, UN Agencies, civil society and other relevant actors, approximately 9.14 million individuals, or 20% of the population, are categorized in Phases 3 and 4 [14]. These phases indicate high levels of acute food insecurity in certain parts of Bangladesh. The poorest households in these areas face significant challenges exacerbated by factors such as high inflation, reduced earnings, and frequent climate-related shocks, which contribute to the severity of food insecurity among the population [14]. The frequency and intensity of natural, economic, and political hazards affecting individuals, businesses, economies, and even entire nations are increasing [15–19]. The concept of resilience has thus gained prominence in governmental and research contexts. Initially introduced in ecology literature by Holling [20], resilience has since been studied and applied across various fields, including socioeconomics [21]. Resilience is commonly defined as the capacity to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from shocks efficiently and effectively [22]. Recent studies have expanded this definition to include the ability to manage persistent risk exposure [23]. In the context of food security analysis, resilience refers to the latent capacity of households to withstand and navigate socioeconomic factors, climate variability, and other shocks [24]. Traditionally viewed as an endpoint, resilience is now understood as a continuous process that can either enhance or diminish response capacities, thereby impacting overall well-being [25]. Resilient food systems are adept at adapting to new conditions while maintaining stable food production and ensuring access for vulnerable populations. They mitigate the impact of shocks and stressors, with social and economic factors playing crucial roles in enhancing resilience. In countries like Bangladesh, where a significant portion of the population relies on agriculture, food insecurity remains a pressing concern. The food system is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on a few staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize, and its interconnectedness with the global food supply chain [14,26–28]. Disruptions in one part of the system can lead to cascading effects throughout. Moreover, the lack of agricultural diversity and reliance on intensive monoculture practices increase vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate shocks. Bangladesh is particularly susceptible to extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts [29], which can severely impact food production and access [30]. Assessing the resilience of communities and households to shocks and threats is crucial as it allows nations to anticipate and effectively address these challenges. Resilience assessments help policymakers and organisations understand how well a community can rebound from adversity. Food security, with its multifaceted and complex nature, has predominantly been studied through vulnerability assessments. However, the methodologies used in these assessments often lack dynamism, which makes precise predictions of potential shocks and incidents challenging [31–33]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) developed the Resilience Index Measurement Analysis (RIMA) to quantify resilience [6,34,35]. This method introduces the concept that resilience can be estimated as a latent variable through a two-step procedure involving observable factors, even when resilience itself is not immediately observable [33]. Recent advancements by FAO have enhanced this approach by using structural equation modelling instead of factor analysis to estimate the resilience index. Additionally, more variables have been included as proxies to represent institutional and natural environments [36]. Applying the RIMA-II model in Bangladesh offers a novel, structured econometric approach to measuring household resilience, an aspect largely absent in previous food security studies. Unlike traditional vulnerability assessments that rely on static indicators, RIMA-II conceptualizes resilience as a latent variable, allowing for a more nuanced and dynamic analysis of the factors influencing resilience capacity. While RIMA-II has been applied in various regions, its use in Bangladesh remains limited, with most existing studies focusing on food security determinants [37,38] or coping strategies [39–48] rather than the interactions among resilience components. Furthermore, prior research lacks a comprehensive resilience index beyond traditional vulnerability assessments, limiting its ability to capture the complex interconnections among resilience factors. Thus, this study makes two main contributions. Firstly, it investigates the key determinants shaping the resilience capacity of households, which influence their ability to adapt and recover from adverse conditions. Second, it assesses how resilience capacity translates into improved food security outcomes. By situating this analysis within the broader context of rural livelihoods, the study aims to provide empirical insights into the mechanisms through which resilience serves as a buffer against food insecurity, offering implications for policy interventions aimed at fostering sustainable rural development. When attempting to understand and enhance resilience, it is crucial to provide necessary resources and techniques to mitigate adverse outcomes, predict and prepare for shocks and stress, eliminate destructive coping mechanisms, and facilitate recovery [49]. Resilience in environmental and socioeconomic systems is demonstrated by responses to negative events and shocks [21], which encompass transformation, adaptation, and absorption responses [50–53]. Resilience, viewed as an intermediate outcome in socioeconomic studies, integrates capacities such as a household’s or community’s ability to cope with shocks [53]. Recent studies have endeavoured to integrate resilience into various development contexts, including food safety [22,54], well-being [55,56], rural development [57–59], and sustainable livelihoods [60–62]. The articles by [32,33] represent early efforts to define and quantify household resilience in the context of food insecurity. These studies focused on the household as the primary unit of analysis, recognising that crucial decisions regarding risk management made at this level, both before and after adverse events impacting food security [33] introduced a resilience index, treated as a latent variable that cannot be directly observed, and employed a two-stage factor analysis approach using measurable variables. Building on this framework [63] applied a similar latent variable model to measure resilience in Northern Bangladesh, highlighting the importance of comprehensively understanding resilience factors across various capacities. Additionally, d’Errico et al. investigated how shocks, particularly conflicts and climate events, influence resilience measurement [24]. Similarly, Ciani et al. aimed to assess household resilience to food insecurity in a changing environment using principal components and multivariate analysis of panel data. Their resilience index indicated that small landowners and agricultural wage workers exhibited lower resilience levels compared to other livelihood groups [64]. Dhraief et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey employing factor analysis and regression models. Their findings highlighted the significant roles of income and food access, adaptive capacity, and social safety nets in enhancing household resilience, as evidenced by their positive correlations with the resilience index [65]. Conversely, asset possession and climate change showed negative associations with household resilience in their study. However, contrasting findings in other studies have indicated that assets can have positive and notable effects [49,66,67]. Rural households generally exhibit less resilient to food shortages compared to urban and peri-urban households [68]. However, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, urban households experienced higher levels of food insecurity than rural households, yet they were more likely to resort to financial and food-compromising coping strategies [48]. Sassi et al. argued that households often turn to less preferred and cheaper food options during times of food insecurity, which can lead to long-term societal impacts and reduced ability to cope [69]. Large family households are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, often relying on lower-quality meals and support from family or friends [70]. Ownership of assets also plays a crucial role in the resilience of smallholder farmers, with households possessing more assets generally exhibiting greater resilience to food insecurity [66]. Food-secure households typically exhibit higher dietary diversity and rely less on coping mechanisms, benefitting from adaptive and absorptive resilience capacities along with sufficient income [71]. Previous studies have highlighted that household resilience to food insecurity is influenced by factors such as income, assets, social safety nets, and adaptive capacity, with resilience levels varying across different livelihood groups and geographic locations [32,34,72,73]. However, findings on the role of assets remain inconclusive, calling for a more nuanced approach that differentiates asset types to better capture their distinct contributions to resilience. Despite the growing use of resilience measurement frameworks, studies in Bangladesh have yet to adopt a comprehensive approach that captures the interplay between various resilience components. Although prior research has identified the resilience determinants [48,63,74], few studies have specifically examined the suitability of RIMA-II for the Bangladeshi context [75]. Traditional vulnerability assessments often fail to account for critical dimensions such as access to services, adaptive strategies, and the differential roles of asset types as drivers of resilience. This study addresses these gaps by employing RIMA-II to systematically measure resilience as a latent construct, offering a more integrated and nuanced approach compared to earlier methods in rural Bangladesh. A key contribution of this research is the disaggregation of asset components, land, livestock, and farm equipment, to assess their distinct effects on resilience. This disaggregation is essential, as each asset type contributes differently to resilience in rural Bangladesh. Land ownership is vital for food production and long-term economic stability [76–78], while livestock assets, despite their perceived benefits, introduce risks related to market volatility [79–81], disease outbreaks [82–88], and climate vulnerability [89–92]. Farm equipment, on the other hand, plays a key role in mechanization and agricultural efficiency, making it distinct from the other asset categories [93–97]. Treating assets as a single, aggregate variable would overlook these critical differences in how they contribute to or detract from resilience. This approach ensures a more accurate and policy-relevant analysis of household resilience dynamics in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to validate resilience determinants has been rare in prior research, emphasizing the need for this methodological advancement. By combining RIMA-II with a robust empirical framework, this study advances the understanding of resilience pathways and generates policy-relevant insights for improving food security in Bangladesh. It is increasingly recognised that one of the most effective ways to reduce or even avert food security crises is to create more resilient livelihoods [24,49]. The Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) was developed within this framework, with pioneering contributions by the FAO [34]. Employing a novel quantitative methodology, RIMA helps explain why and how certain households can withstand shocks and stressors more effectively than others. Resilience, being a multidimensional concept that cannot be directly observed, must be assessed through proxies by focusing on the needs of the most vulnerable groups. The new RIMA-II methodology offers enhanced guidance for successfully planning, implementing, overseeing, and assessing aid. The RIMA II model was employed to identify and study household resilience [36]. The RIMA-II model enables a better understanding of households` circumstances and needs, as well as identifying potential areas for improving future assistance. Access to Basic Services (ABS), Assets (AST), and Adaptive Capacity (AC) are the widely recognised pillars of the Resilience Capacity Index (RCI). Due to the lack of available data on Social Safety Nets (SSNs), our study focuses on the other three pillars. To estimate each pillar, variables were considered based on a literature review, data availability, context analysis, and statistical properties. ABS refers to the ability to meet households’ basic needs and encompasses the quality, effectiveness, and access to basic services [98]. This study assesses ABS through the following components: floor type (X1), wall type (X2), housing condition (X3), roof type (X4), sanitation type (X5), source of water (X6), cooking fuel type (X7), distance to health facilities from residence (in kilometers) (X8) and distance to the market (in kilometers) (X9). AC refers to a household’s ability to cope with and adapt to an unfamiliar situation, enabling them to maintain everyday affairs without long-term disruptions [32,36]. It indicates that more adaptive residents can handle adverse situations without reducing their standard of living [49,99]. In this study, this pillar includes the following components: household head`s employment location (X10), household head`s occupation type (X11), savings (X12), household income per month (X13), household head`s education year (X14), and diversified sources of income (X15). An essential prerequisite for shock response is AST, the second pillar of the RIMA-II model [32]. Assets encompass a household’s income-producing and not-producing assets [98], serving as indicators of the household’s economic circumstances and providing insight into the impact of shocks on households. The proxies used to construct AST include land holding (in decimal) (X16), land value (X17), livestock value (X18), livestock quantity (X19), farm equipment value (X20), farm equipment quantity (X21), and non-agricultural asset value (X22). The RIMA-II is divided into two sections: a descriptive and a causal analysis [98]. The RCI used to assess households and inform policy, is generated through descriptive analysis. The RCI is constructed in two stages. The first stage, the formative model, employs factor analysis of observable variables to estimate attributes (pillars) of resilience. The second stage, the measurement model, utilizes a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to calculate the RCI based on these pillars while considering the relationships between RCI and food security indicators. The developmental model links resilience to the pillars, while the measurement model focuses on food security indicators such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Food Expenditure (FX). Food Consumption Score (FCS) collects household-level data on the diversity and frequency of food groups consumed over seven days. This data is weighted according to the relative nutritional value of each food group. The main food groups and their respective weights are: staples (weight 2), pulses (weight 3), vegetables (weight 1), fruit (weight 1), meat/fish (weight 4), milk (weight 4), sugar (weight 0.5) and oil (weight 0.5). To calculate FCS, the first step is to sum the consumption frequencies of food items within each group. Next, each food group`s total is multiplied by its respective weight [100]. Food Expenditure (FX) refers to the total cost of food obtained, whether purchased or acquired through other means, including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. This calculation also encompasses food expenditures on dining out at venues such as bars, restaurants, food courts, workplace canteens and street vendors [101]. FX is calculated by multiplying the quantity of food consumed over a seven-day period by its unit price, expressed in Bangladeshi Tk (1 US$ = 110 BDT (Bangladesh Bank, 2024). Based on the literature and the conceptual framework depicted in Fig 1, observable variables are expected to significantly influence latent variables or pillars. Furthermore, these latent variables are expected to have a significant impact on the RCI. Finally, the RCI is expected to significantly influence food security indicators, specifically, FCS and FX. Previous studies [14,15,19,20,25,29,41–43,76–79] have consistently highlighted the substantial influence of various observable variables on latent pillars, the significant impact of latent pillars on RCI, and the consequential effect of RCI on food security. Consequently, this study proposes the following hypotheses: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g001 The observed variables (X1, X2,.. Xn) used in this study were derived from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) 2018. This household survey is administered by Data Analysis and Technical Assistance Limited and designed and supervised by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS sample is statistically representative of rural Bangladesh, covering the nation`s seven administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. The survey includes 325 primary sampling units (PSUs) or villages, encompassing a total of 5,604 households in the BIHS dataset. Therefore, this study utilises a cross-sectional dataset of 5,604 households to achieve its research objectives. This dataset serves as the basis for assessing resilience through the pillars of ABS, AC, and AST, and their impact on the RCI and food security indicators. Twenty-two measurement items were used to construct latent pillars of the RCI, which is presented in Appendix Table 1 in S1 File. Each observable variable was assessed using a five-point summated Likert scale, where respondents rated their conditions (1 = very poor; 2 = poor; 3 = moderate; 4 = rich; 5 = very rich). The study utilized a quantitative approach. Initially, descriptive statistics were used to summarize and describe the observable variables of the pillars related to the pillars of resilience and food security indicators. This involved calculating measures such as means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions to provide a clear picture of the characteristics of the data. Statistical factorial analyses were employed to test the study’s hypotheses. To assess the factorial validity of the constructs and explore the latent pillars in the data, exploratory factor analysis was performed following [102]. Given the interconnections among latent constructs, we allowed for inter-factor correlation using the maximum likelihood factor extraction method with orthogonal varimax rotation. Subsequently, structural equation modeling (SEM) was exclusively used for descriptive purposes to understand the explanatory power of the pillars and their relationships with the RCI. This approach is a powerful statistical technique that allows researchers to test complex relationships among variables. It was used in this study to examine the linear correlations between the underlying factors (in this case, the pillars) and the latent variable RCI [103]. The formative model, represented by structural Equation (1), links resilience (η) to the pillars (xi). In contrast, the measurement model, represented by Equation (2), is defined by the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and household food expenditure (FX). The upper portion of the path diagram (Fig 2) illustrates the relationship between the resilience pillars, as measured by error εR, and the disturbance term of the structural estimation. The measuring model is represented by arrows pointing toward the food consumption Score and the food expenditure in the lower half of the structural model. Since the estimated RCI lacks a specific measurement scale, a scale has been proposed with the coefficient of the food consumption loading (˄1) set to 1. This assumption posits that a one standard deviation increase in RCI corresponds to a one standard deviation increase in food intake. This determination also establishes the unit of measurement for the other outcome indicator (˄2), alongside the variance of the two food security indicators, as depicted in Equations (3) and (4): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g002 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. It utilized publicly available data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS), administered by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS obtained formal written informed consent from all respondents prior to data collection. The summary statistics of all the attributes used to construct the resilience pillars are presented in Appendix Table 2 in S1 File. According to the established criteria [102,104], data is considered normal if kurtosis falls between −7 and +7 and the skewness between −2 and +2. However, our results indicate that some attribute values exceed these thresholds, suggesting potential outliers that may be excluded from further analysis. Cronbach’s alpha assesses with which respondents answer items on a scale or subscale [105]. A Cronbach’s alpha score greater than 0.6 is generally considered reliable with values between 0.6 to 0.8 deemed acceptable [106,107]. The reliability alpha value for the adaptive capacity (AC) pillar significantly exceeded the threshold of 0.70, indicating adequate reliability [105]. The other four pillars also demonstrated reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values greater than 0.60 [106–108]. Following the initial reliability assessment, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to explore the latent factor structure. The maximum likelihood method was used to identify components and establish the pattern matrix. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.778, surpassing the maximum acceptable level of 0.5 [109]. The criteria, which include a significant correlation matrix determinant of 0.009, a KMO value of 0.778, and a significant Bartlett’s Chi-square of χ2 = 26648.163, p = 0.000, confirmed the adequacy of the sample size chosen for the study [110], indicating sufficient intercorrelation for factorial analysis. Initially identifying ten factors, we retained five factors that collectively explained 82.68% of the total variance in the data, exceeding the acceptable threshold of 60% [102]. Table 1 presents the pattern matrix, demonstrating how each numbered questionnaire item loaded precisely (values above 0.50 on a single component) onto its respective factor. Typically, minimum item-factor loadings of 0.3 to 0.4 are recommended [111–113]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t001 Table 1 categorizes items X1(floor type), X2 (wall type), and X3 (housing condition) under factor 1 as ABS, explaining 29.74% of the total variance. Factor 2, labelled AC, includes X10 (household head`s employment location) and X11 (household head`s occupation type), explaining 23.49% of the variance. Factors 3 and 4 are labelled Ld_A and Lv_A, respectively, and explain 11.09% and 10.25% of the variance. They comprise items X16 (land size), X17 (land value), X18 (livestock value), and X19 (livestock quantity). Item X20 (farm equipment value) and X21 (farm equipment quantity) of factor 5 are labelled FE. Although factors Ld_A, Lv_A, and FE collectively represent the single factor named Assets (AST), they are labelled as separate factors based on our country’s perspective. The loadings of the items range from 0.51 to 0.92. Table 2 presents the correlation matrix of the five factors included in the analysis. ABS shows significant positive correlations with Ld_A (0.042) and FE (0.034) at the 1% significance level, as these factors contribute to higher income levels that enable households to afford better services. ABS also negatively correlates with AC (0.028) and Lv_A (0.026) at the 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively, possibly due to market volatility and health-related concerns affecting livestock income and service accessibility. AC demonstrates a significant positive correlation with Ld_A (0.023) and Lv_A (0.035) at the 10% and 1% significance levels, respectively, but shows an insignificant correlation with FE (0.017). Ld_A shows a significant positive correlation with both Lv_A (0.047) and FE (0.072) at the 1% level. Lv_A and FE correlate significantly at the 5% level (0.030). Despite the correlations observed among factors, there is no evidence of significant multicollinearity, as no correlation coefficient exceeds 0.8 [114–116]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t002 Table 3 presents the findings from the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model, which was derived using structural equation modelling. In this case, we consider the broader contextual framework to accurately analyze the 2018 data, which includes ongoing food insecurity, a substantial influx of Rohingya refugees facing acute malnutrition amidst monsoon-related hazards, and deep-rooted structural vulnerabilities such as limited agricultural diversification. These factors influenced both households` potential for resilience and the outcomes observed in our SEM model. Study shows that ABS exhibits a significant coefficient of 0.429, indicating that a well-structured living condition with essential facilities enhances households’ resilience capacity. This finding also indicates that households with better access to essential services are more equipped to cope with food insecurity and recover from shocks. Thus, the study’s findings support hypothesis A: access to basic services significantly influences the resilience capacity index. Our results reveal a positive correlation between ABS and RCI (Table 3), consistent with previous studies [32,36,117,118], which suggest that access to basic services enhances economic opportunities, knowledge, and overall well-being, thereby contributing to greater resilience. In contrast, studies by [53,66,119,120] report a negative association, attributing decreasing service quality as households become poorer in their respective countries. Previous studies have often identified AC as a significant influencing factor [24,65,67,121,117]. However, our findings indicate that AC is a positive but insignificant factor, suggesting that institutional and economic barriers impede the effectiveness of this factor. While education, skill development, access to information, and access to credit are critical components of AC, their impact on resilience is highly dependent on external factors such as labor market conditions and institutional access [122,123]. This discrepancy may be attributed to Bangladesh`s high vulnerability to global changes, significant socio-economic challenges, and limitations in institutional capacity [124–126]. In Bangladesh, people are unable to leverage their adaptive skills for resilience due to a lack of employment opportunities [119,125,127,128]. Moreover, limited access to credit, and financial services may restrict households from transferring their adaptive strategies to long-term stability [43,125,128]. Furthermore, gender-based disparities in access to resources and decision-making power also undermine the significance of AC [54,129–133]. As a result, households in Bangladesh may exhibit lower adaptive capacity compared to those in other developing or developed countries [43,47,134,135]. Thus, our results do not support hypothesis B: adaptive capacity significantly influences the resilience capacity index. The “Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II” report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) discusses how adaptive capacity contributes to resilience but notes that its impact may not always be significant in certain contexts [36]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t003 The critical role of assets in resilience capacity has been widely recognised, as they constitute the most significant pillar for the RCI. Similar findings have been reported by other authors, such as [49,66,67,119] in the context of Malian and Ethiopian households, highlighting assets as the most pertinent factor for RCI, which aligns with our study findings. However, this study takes a more granular approach to segregating the assets into three distinct categories; land asset, livestock asset, and farm equipment, to identify their unique contributions to resilience building. This disaggregation is crucial, as each asset type plays a unique role in shaping a household`s ability to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks. In the context of Bangladesh, only a small proportion of households own all three asset types of assets simultaneously, making it essential to analyse their individual and combined impacts on resilience. Our results demonstrate a significant coefficient of 0.119 for Ld_A and 0.042 for FE, indicating a positive influence on RCI, thereby corroborating hypotheses C and E. Land assets are crucial for resilience building as they provide financial stability and income through agriculture [76–78,136]. Additionally, having farm equipment ensures household mechanization and agricultural efficiency, which boosts farm production and enhances household resilience [93–97]. Since these assets play distinct roles in shaping resilience capacity, it is essential to calculate them separately. However, Lv_A demonstrates a significant negative value of 0.053 suggesting that it has a significant negative impact on resilience in Bangladesh. Because it has a high mortality rate of livestock due to natural disasters and high disease outbreaks [137,138]. High vulnerability to climate change may, directly and indirectly, affect livestock production systems, resulting in negative asset values [47,89–92,139–142]. Lv_A are influenced by several interrelated factors that exhibit a counterintuitive negative relationship with resilience, such as market volatility, disease outbreaks, high maintenance cost, and climatic vulnerability. During economic downturns or supply chain disruptions, farmers are forced to sell their livestock at lower prices, undermining their financial stability [79–81]. Disease outbreaks, such as foot-and-mouth disease or avian influenza, frequently affect livestock in Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses for rural households. Limited access to veterinary care and inadequate disease prevention measures exacerbate this issue [82–88]. Livestock also involves costly sectors such as feeding, healthcare, and shelter, imposing additional financial burdens on households. While land or farm equipment offers long-term productivity gains, livestock requires continuous investment, making it a riskier asset for resilience building. These combined factors suggest that although livestock is traditionally seen as a liquid asset, it needs more infrastructural development to contribute to long-term resilience in the Bangladeshi context. Consequently, Lv_A cannot verify hypothesis D, which suggests that livestock assets positively influence resilience capacity. Our study indicates that RCI positively influences FCS and FX with significant coefficients of 0.778 and 0.688, respectively. That means households with higher resilience are less likely to experience deteriorating food security and are better positioned to maintain or restore food consumption and expenditure [24]. Policymakers should prioritize resilience-building as a core component of food security programming, employing multidimensional frameworks such as RIMA-II in Bangladesh for targeted, long-term strategies. Our results support hypotheses F and G, which concern the impact of resilience on food consumption and expenditure. These outcomes remain robust across various model specifications. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the model under consideration exhibits a significant likelihood ratio Chi-square of 1200.82 at the 1% significance level. The first chi-square compares the model against the saturated test, while the second chi-square compares the baseline versus the saturated model. The saturated model demonstrates a perfect fit for the covariance structure. According to Browne et al., the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) indicates an adequate fit with values between 0.05 and 0.08 [143]. A value close to one on both the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) denotes a good fit, as suggested by Hair et al. and Bentler [102,144]. The coefficient of determination (CD = 1.00) also confirms a perfect fit. Typically, for an adequate fit, the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) should be less than 0.05, as recommended by Hu and Bentler [145]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t004 Our study results demonstrate that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment significantly enhances household resilience. The positive impact of these factors on RCI suggests promising avenues for further research. Future studies could delve into how these components bolster agricultural system resilience, aiding government efforts in designing effective action plans. Exploring potential interactions among these factors could yield insights into the intricate dynamics of resilience. Interestingly, adaptive capacity showed no noticeable impact on RCI, highlighting the distinction between adaptation and resilience. Although our study indicates that livestock has a negative impact on resilience, it remains an invaluable resource for food security, income generation, and financial stability in rural economies. Livestock plays a crucial role in resilience management by acting as a liquid asset during economic crises, enhancing agricultural output through soil fertility and draft power, and improving access to financing. Building resilience remains the most effective strategy to withstand shocks. In developing countries, policies and programs aimed at improving household resilience can significantly advance long-term food security. Humanitarian resilience initiatives should prioritize addressing rural populations` needs, as they face heightened exposure to food insecurity. Study results indicate that prioritising access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation in rural areas is crucial for fostering local and national resilience. Furthermore, enhancing incentives for land protection and promoting sustainable land management practices can enhance agricultural resilience. Policies supporting agricultural technology and equipment can also bolster resilience. Implementing social safety nets and encouraging farmers to diversify their revenue streams are effective strategies beyond human-centric protection measures. To enhance the sustainability of livestock assets, policymakers should focus on improving the affordability and accessibility of veterinary services and climate-resilient livestock management at the grassroots level. Subsidies on livestock medicine, feed, and improved breeds should also be provided to reduce maintenance costs. Strengthening adaptive capacity requires skill-based education, financial inclusion, and institutional support to foster entrepreneurship and human capital development, thereby creating more employment opportunities and improving infrastructure. Additionally, targeted awareness programs should encourage women’s participation in household and community decision-making, ensuring gender-inclusive resilience-building strategies. However, the data used in our analysis were not explicitly gathered for resilience measurement purposes, which may limit the depth and accuracy of our study. Using cross-sectional data limits the ability to capture dynamic changes in household resilience over time, as it provides only a snapshot rather than reflecting long-term trends. Thereby restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions about long-term resilience to food insecurity. It is important to acknowledge that, while this study emphasizes the role of land access and basic services in strengthening household resilience, social capital, gender dynamics, and power disparities are also significant, though less visible, factors influencing resilience in rural Bangladesh. These factors could not be explicitly incorporated into the SEM analysis due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, the absence of data related to recent shocks, disasters, or conflicts in our analysis limits the comprehensiveness of our study. These data constraints hinder our ability to examine the impact of acute events on household resilience, potentially overlooking critical dimensions of resilience dynamics. Future research should utilize longitudinal datasets specifically designed for resilience measurement, incorporating multiple survey rounds to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, integrating socio-institutional variables with real-time data on shocks, disasters, and conflicts will enhance the comprehensiveness of resilience analysis, enabling a more accurate assessment of household responses to food insecurity.

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. For fans of the Savannah Bananas, it’s about more than just baseball. In a more fast-paced version of the sport known as Banana Ball, players backflip as they catch fly balls, take choreographed dance breaks between batters and more. The Bananas have sold out all 115 games on their 2025 schedule, and are even more popular online, with a larger social audience than any MLB franchise. The unusual approach is paying off: Forbes estimates that the four-team Banana Ball organization will post more than $100 million in revenue this year, and that the Bananas are worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million. That’s about half as much as MLB’s least valuable team, the Miami Marlins. President Donald Trump issued a proclamation Friday that would impose an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, which are used by companies to hire skilled workers from abroad. It’s a dramatic increase over existing program fees, which include $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for the petition. MORE: Shares of major Indian tech services firms plunged sharply on Monday in response, and U.S. tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, which are among the biggest sponsors of H-1B visas for foreign workers, were also down in premarket trading. Around 73% of all H-1B workers whose applications were approved in the fiscal year 2023 were Indian born, the Pew Research Center reported, while China ranked a distant second with 12% approvals. The decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show put a spotlight on Nexstar Media, the largest TV station owner and operator in the U.S., and its founder Perry Sook, who has largely stayed out of the spotlight over nearly four decades as chairman. Sook, who was compensated roughly $35 million as Nexstar’s chief executive in 2024, told investors in an earnings call shortly after Election Day that he hoped a second Trump Administration would help the firm expand further. President Donald Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal that would keep TikTok online in the U.S., and the White House said on Saturday the deal would be signed “in the coming days.” Six of the seven board seats for TikTok’s U.S. entity will be occupied by Americans, who will also oversee the platform’s algorithm, and Oracle, the cloud computing firm headed by billionaire Larry Ellison, will lead TikTok’s “data and privacy.” Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI is expected to raise $10 billion in a funding round that would give the company a $200 billion valuation, CNBC reported. That would make xAI worth more than competitor Anthropic’s $183 billion, but less than ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is eyeing a secondary share selloff that could value it at $500 billion. Private equity firm Veritas Capital counts on government spending for the majority of its portfolio companies’ revenue, and CEO Ramzi Musallam remains confident about its growth despite cuts from the Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Veritas closed its ninth flagship fund at $14.4 billion earlier this month, and Musallam says the firm is focused on companies with “must-have” technology that reduces wasteful spending. No U.S. president, or extended family, has used the office to profit as successfully as the Trumps. With crypto as the big driver, the family (including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner) is now worth an estimated $10 billion, having nearly doubled their net worth since last year’s election. As a cofounder of 3BRAND, New York Giants quarterback Russell Wilson has quietly built a children’s sportswear company that surpassed $100 million in sales in 2024, despite headwinds in the retail market. It’s one of many business endeavors for Wilson, who tied for No. 49 on Forbes’ 2025 list of the world’s highest-paid athletes. Hundreds of airports may no longer require you to remove liquids from bags during security screenings, but it’s too soon for the policy to officially change nationwide, aviation security experts say. The latest X-ray technology can create three-dimensional images of passengers’ carry-on bags, but it could take at least a decade before all U.S. airports have the newer scanners. GPUs (graphics processing units), commonly designed by chip giant Nvidia, have become a crucial engine for artificial intelligence. Access to them can determine a company’s fortunes, and CoreWeave, which trades on the Nasdaq, has built a $50 billion (market cap) business by becoming one of their go-to brokers. After pioneering a new kind of financing that helped CoreWeave borrow $29 billion, CEO Michael Intrator now balances shareholders’ qualms about deepening debt and widespread fears about an AI bubble with his broader ambition: to provide compute not just to the tech giants but to every company integrating AI into its operations. In less than a decade, the business has spun up a data center empire, booking $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 (net losses: $860 million, for a negative 45% margin) and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 (net losses: $605 million, or –28%). Its stock price has more than doubled since its March IPO, trouncing the broader Nasdaq’s return of 23.9% and minting at least five billionaires in the process. Intrator is now worth $6.7 billion, landing him on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the first time, along with cofounder Brian Venturo. The company’s remarkable growth has stemmed from ferocious global demand for GPUs. The AI cloud computing market was $230 billion in 2024 and, assuming the boom continues, is poised to explode to $400 billion by 2028, according to Wall Street analysts. “I’ve never seen a supply/demand imbalance like this in the 40 years I’ve been investing,” says Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital, which invested a total of $25 million in CoreWeave. WHY IT MATTERS “CoreWeave has catapulted into prominence as one of the leading AI cloud compute providers with marquee customers like OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta,” says Forbes staff writer Rashi Shrivastava. “Shedding its crypto past and betting big on the value of Nvidia’s coveted GPUs, Michael Intrator took his company to a $50 billion valuation. But he relied (heavily) on debt, backed by those very GPUs that are depreciating a lot faster today. With billions on the line and concerns of an AI bubble, the stakes are far greater than ever before.” MORE This AI Cloud Provider Just Minted Four New Billionaires Workplaces often run on ambition—but many overachievers burn themselves out as a result of never feeling like they’re allowed to take a break. It’s critical to normalize taking strategic pauses for reflection after major sprints, and don’t just reward those who keep up the highest output for the longest. Ambition can be energizing and fulfilling if pursued sustainably. A federal judge threw out President Donald Trump’s $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times on Friday. What was the reason? A. It didn’t have merit B. Insufficient evidence C. Statute of limitations D. It was too long Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

Title: Asset-lite, profit-heavy: How Porter built India’s biggest intra-city logistics empire

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/New Delhi: Azim Qureshi’s story is hardly unique. It is the story of millions of people who run small and mid-sized businesses across India. Qureshi, 54, runs a kirana store in Delhi, an operation that requires moving his stock on time everyday, across multiple tranches. Until a few years ago, he relied on a chaotic network of local fleet operators, with varying degrees of success and frustration. “Sometimes they showed up, sometimes they didn’t. Halfway through a delivery, they’d call saying the vehicle broke down, or suddenly, hike the price," he said. One day, help arrived on a smartphone, brought to him by his 24-year-old son. He introduced the senior Qureshi to Porter, a company now known for intra-city logistics—essentially the short-haul movement of goods within city limits. “My son books goods on the Porter app, for supplies from the mandi to my shop, and sometimes even from my shop to customers," the kirana owner said. “It can still be chaotic, but most of the time, it works." Then there is Anil Sharma, co-founder of Newtreo, a food and beverage brand with yearly sales of ₹16 crore a year. For a long time, he found himself trapped in a frustrating cycle of two-day lead times to deliver his ready-to-eat products—energy drinks, non-alcoholic beer, fruit juices among others—to customers. Using Porter brought that lead time down to two hours. “We end up using Porter at least three-four times everyday. We don’t mind paying a higher cost…when compared to a local player, there is also far more transparency in pricing," Sharma said, adding that at times, unorganised transporters hike price by as much as two-fold without any explanation. Newtreo also uses Delhivery, a larger logistics company, for bigger consignments across different cities. “While Porter is really good for intra-city and smaller shipments, Delhivery is more apt for larger orders," Sharma said. In 2014, Uttam Digga, Pranav Goel and Vikas Choudhary, the three founders of Porter, saw the chaos, mistrust, and inefficiency Qureshi and Sharma described. They set out to organize logistics for small businesses by aggregating mini-trucks, inspired by Uber’s ride-hailing model. The intra-city logistics market has always been a tough nut to crack. Orders are small, margins thin, and fuel costs unforgiving. Not to mention the stiff competition from a web of informal fleet operators. But Porter’s bet on an asset-lite model that caters to small businesses eventually paid off—the company was able to turn what looked like a messy, fragmented market into a system that could generate predictability, revenue, and profit. In 2024-25, the company’s revenue surged nearly 57% to ₹4,342 crore; it posted its first ever profit of ₹55 crore, from a loss of ₹96 crore a year earlier. India’s intra-city parcel delivery market, in 2024-25, was estimated at $600–800 million by Redseer, a research firm. Porter leads the pack, well ahead of Rapido, Borzo, Uber, Uncle Delivery and others, with commissions typically at 14–16%, said Mrigank Gutgutia, partner at the firm. That is not all. The company’s good run includes one of the largest fund raises this year— $200 million—from prominent investors including Kedaara Capital and Wellington Management. The round, which pegged the company’s valuation at around $1.2 billion, is yet to close. The capital raise is likely to touch $300 million, with new investors expected to join the cap table, multiple people familiar with the matter told Mint. We spoke to nearly a dozen stakeholders, including lawyers, consultants, logistics experts, investors and founder Pranav Goel to understand how the company cracked this difficult market. Their accounts reveal a story of sharp pivots, structural headwinds, and a high stakes balancing act between growth and profitability. That act would continue to shape the company’s trajectory, going ahead. The unlikely gamblePorter was not always in the business of short-haul logistics. Like we mentioned earlier, the Bengaluru-based company began as a mini-truck aggregation service, first, by catering to deliveries within cities and then foraying into inter-city operations. “While we were new to intra-city, we were ambitious," said founder Goel. “We thought we should also solve for inter-city and larger enterprises within the first year of business. We started multiple businesses which were very different from each other." View Full Image Porter began as a mini-truck aggregation service. Doing too many things too early proved costly. Inter-city and intra-city logistics run on different mechanics. In the first business, operators work with larger shipments, higher margins and the luxury of planning routes a day in advance. Intra-city, on the other hand, is about immediacy—customers expect a vehicle in 5–15 minutes—often for an order worth barely ₹500. Margins are razor-thin, and efficiency depends on real-time allocation. At the peak of India’s e-commerce boom, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal were pumping volumes and capital into logistics. Soon, the inter-city segment overheated. Inefficiencies and cash burn made the model unsustainable, quickly cooling investor enthusiasm. Porter, competing with deep-pocketed rivals such as Mahindra’s SmartShift, was burning way too much capital. The founders pulled back. “The company chose to tighten their belt and took some hard calls to dramatically bring down costs—they shut the inter-city vertical and remained laser focused on their core area," Sasha Mirchandani, founder and managing partner at Kae Capital, the earliest investor in Porter, said. The startup, next, figured out a sweet spot. “The primary issue was severe underutilization. A vehicle, which could do four-five trips a day, was only doing a single trip back then. So, there was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses," Goel recalled. There was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses. — Pranav Goel Inefficiencies ran the deepest when it came to small businesses. “They deliberately focused on small and medium businesses while competitors chased larger enterprise accounts or individual customers," an industry executive said, asking not to be named. “They have built their model on sheer density." Porter’s ‘density model’ essentially refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. The right vehicle could be a bike for a parcel delivery, and small trucks, or even three-wheelers, for heavier loads. Goel recalled that his team spent months largely on the streets, visiting wholesale markets and interacting with small business clusters. “We would explain how their transportation needs could be done through us. We helped them understand how we could be more reliable; help in bringing down their logistics cost," he said. “We replicated the same process with truck drivers and vehicle operators, assuring them of better vehicle utilization." Porter’s ‘density model’ refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. Those early efforts worked. Porter says it now works with about two million small and medium businesses every month. An investor Mint spoke to, who didn’t want to be identified, said that Porter’s near-monopoly in intra-city logistics is built on sticky small and medium enterprise clients, loyal truckers, and an asset-lite model. “Supply and demand have become fairly concentrated for them. As the marketplace matured, the unit economics also began to show positively," the person said. The 2018 momentA pivotal moment came in February 2018. The Mahindra Group was scouting for opportunities to invest in the shared mobility sector. It zeroed in on Porter—at that time, it had over 10,000 vehicles on its platform and had executed 15,00,000 deliveries in the previous three years, according to a press statement. Mahindra announced that SmartShift, its on-demand logistics service, would merge with Porter. The auto-to-software conglomerate also invested ₹65 crore in the two entities. More than cash, the deal gave the young startup both validation and muscle in a still-fragile market. It unlocked Mahindra’s fleet, a wider customer base, and hard lessons from the ground. “Logistics is different and complex in every country and being backed by the Mahindra gave them a stronger understanding of the arena. A pure-play financial investor wouldn’t have been able to provide that," said a person involved in the transaction who didn’t want to be identified. Mahindra, according to data from Tracxn, went on to increase its bets on Porter in subsequent years. Since that deal, Porter’s investor roster also expanded to include Tiger Global Management, Vitruvian Partners and Elev8 Venture Partners. The reshuffleBy mid-2023, Porter felt confident enough to revisit inter-city logistics again, with a courier service offering door-to-door delivery. The company took on rivals such as Delhivery and Ekart head-on. In 2023, Porter also reshuffled leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. “Uttam’s strategy and competency in driving growth, taking risk and operational rigour is unmatched," Goel said, adding that the transition was based on the company’s ambitions and target for the next decade. In 2023, Porter reshuffled its leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. The transition also coincided with the company taking its foot off the growth accelerator to focus on profitability. Between 2020-21 and 2022-23, losses nearly tripled to ₹175 crore even as revenue grew over fivefold to ₹1,789 crore, according to data from Tracxn. Investors saw the red ink not as weakness, but intent. “The period of widening losses was a function of increased competitive intensity post the pandemic. Porter wanted to focus on growth and ride the online boom. Once they were comfortable with their top line, they made an internal call to bring down losses," said another investor, requesting anonymity. The logistics industry, overall, has also seen a reset— companies such as Delhivery, Rapido, Shadowfax and Shiprocket have turned profitable or have cut losses. This is largely a function of investors backing firms that can rein in burn, Mrigank Gutgutia of Redseer noted. Apart from inter-city logistics, Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification. It is building out newer revenue streams like packers and movers services (which contributes to 5% of overall revenue), among others. In parallel, the company wants to expand beyond India—it has already started operating in the Middle East and other countries in the Indian subcontinent. A GST squeeze?Despite its successes, Porter faces a fresh challenge: The new goods and services tax (GST) regime. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced rationalisation of indirect taxes, with most products and services falling into two slabs—5% and 18%. But this has created ambiguity for Porter, as its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. View Full Image Traditional road transporters fall under the 5% GST bracket. The GST Council has brought local delivery services via e-commerce operators under the 18% slab, with platforms liable to pay tax under reverse charge if delivery partners are unregistered, explained Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain and Associates, a law firm.“This applies to standalone delivery apps like Porter, Uber Delivery or Rapido’s courier services, not to goods platforms such as Amazon or Flipkart where delivery is incidental to the sale of goods," Jain added. Meanwhile, the biggest cost for logistics firms, fuel, is kept outside the GST net. So, logistics firms can’t claim credit on it. This could create a cascading tax burden that inflates last-mile logistics costs. “Every rupee spent on fuel is a sunk cost, pushing up operating expenses," said Kulraj Ashpnani, partner at Dhruva Advisors, a tax advisory firm. However, Porter argues it is a ‘digital Goods Transport Agency (GTA),’ while an offline GTA is simply a traditional road transporter that issues a consignment note and falls under the 5% GST bracket. “We classify ourselves as a digital GTA. The new GST rule seems to be for delivery services meant for convenience of end consumers, unlike Porter, which serves the core goods transportation need for MSMEs," Goel said. “From a first-principles perspective, I don’t think the government’s intent is to tax digital GTAs differently from traditional offline GTAs—that would create a major disparity. A high digital tax would push MSMEs back to offline channels, which may not be the intent," he added. Nevertheless, ‘Digital GTA’ isn’t a formal GST category—it’s an industry shorthand for tech-led platforms. Goel added that the company is evaluating the impact on its business and hoped that the government will come up with clarifications soon. “Much of this extra tax will either get baked into what the customer pays or chip away at what the delivery partner earns," said Satish Meena, co-founder of Datum Intelligence, a research firm. “Platforms themselves can’t really absorb it right now—they’re chasing profitability while pouring capital into growth and new bets." Porter, which has navigated many tricky scenarios in the past, and built its unicorn business on the promise of bringing order to mess, now has a new chaos to cut through. Key Takeaways India’s intra-city parcel delivery market was estimated at $600–800 million in FY25 by Redseer. Porter is currently the leader of the pack, ahead of Rapido, Borzo, and Uber. The startup focused on small businesses while rivals chased larger enterprise accounts. Its ‘density model’—better asset utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price—has worked. In 2024-25, the company posted its first ever profit. Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification—inter-city, packers and movers services etc. It faces a fresh challenge—the new goods and services tax regime. Under GST 2.0, its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. Porter was not always in the business of short-haul logistics.

Mahindra announced that SmartShift, its on-demand logistics service, would merge with Porter. The auto-to-software conglomerate also invested ₹65 crore in the two entities. More than cash, the deal gave the young startup both validation and muscle in a still-fragile market. It unlocked Mahindra’s fleet, a wider customer base, and hard lessons from the ground. “Logistics is different and complex in every country and being backed by the Mahindra gave them a stronger understanding of the arena.

The company took on rivals such as Delhivery and Ekart head-on. In 2023, Porter also reshuffled leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role.

The logistics industry, overall, has also seen a reset— companies such as Delhivery, Rapido, Shadowfax and Shiprocket have turned profitable or have cut losses. This is largely a function of investors backing firms that can rein in burn, Mrigank Gutgutia of Redseer noted. Apart from inter-city logistics, Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification. It is building out newer revenue streams like packers and movers services (which contributes to 5% of overall revenue), among others. In parallel, the company wants to expand beyond India—it has already started operating in the Middle East and other countries in the Indian subcontinent. A GST squeeze?Despite its successes, Porter faces a fresh challenge: The new goods and services tax (GST) regime. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced rationalisation of indirect taxes, with most products and services falling into two slabs—5% and 18%. But this has created ambiguity for Porter, as its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. View Full Image Traditional road transporters fall under the 5% GST bracket. The GST Council has brought local delivery services via e-commerce operators under the 18% slab, with platforms liable to pay tax under reverse charge if delivery partners are unregistered, explained Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain and Associates, a law firm.“This applies to standalone delivery apps like Porter, Uber Delivery or Rapido’s courier services, not to goods platforms such as Amazon or Flipkart where delivery is incidental to the sale of goods," Jain added. Meanwhile, the biggest cost for logistics firms, fuel, is kept outside the GST net. So, logistics firms can’t claim credit on it. This could create a cascading tax burden that inflates last-mile logistics costs. “Every rupee spent on fuel is a sunk cost, pushing up operating expenses," said Kulraj Ashpnani, partner at Dhruva Advisors, a tax advisory firm. However, Porter argues it is a ‘digital Goods Transport Agency (GTA),’ while an offline GTA is simply a traditional road transporter that issues a consignment note and falls under the 5% GST bracket. “We classify ourselves as a digital GTA. The new GST rule seems to be for delivery services meant for convenience of end consumers, unlike Porter, which serves the core goods transportation need for MSMEs," Goel said. “From a first-principles perspective, I don’t think the government’s intent is to tax digital GTAs differently from traditional offline GTAs—that would create a major disparity. A high digital tax would push MSMEs back to offline channels, which may not be the intent," he added. Nevertheless, ‘Digital GTA’ isn’t a formal GST category—it’s an industry shorthand for tech-led platforms. Goel added that the company is evaluating the impact on its business and hoped that the government will come up with clarifications soon. “Much of this extra tax will either get baked into what the customer pays or chip away at what the delivery partner earns," said Satish Meena, co-founder of Datum Intelligence, a research firm. “Platforms themselves can’t really absorb it right now—they’re chasing profitability while pouring capital into growth and new bets."

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up digital advertising business

After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire during a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed," Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Trump’s $100K H-1B Fee Sends Shockwaves Through Tech And Cybersecurity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2025/09/22/trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-sends-shockwaves-through-tech-and-cybersecurity/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T11:00:00Z

ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. President Donald Trump signed a sudden proclamation Friday that no one saw coming. It imposes a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions for foreign nationals outside the United States. The one-time fee, which does not apply to existing visa holders or renewals, takes effect immediately. The proclamation, called “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” also raises prevailing wage requirements and introduces a national interest exception that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee in certain cases. It’s set to last 12 months unless extended. This order represents one of the most dramatic changes to the H-1B visa system in decades. As with Trump’s tariffs announcement, the proclamation sparked a strong public response. For years companies have paid relatively modest filing fees to sponsor high-skill workers. Now, the cost of a single new petition rivals the salary of an entry-level engineer. The administration says the move is intended to protect U.S. workers, prevent wage suppression and ensure that foreign hires are limited to cases of clear national interest. Many said that the news came out of nowhere and warned that it could harm American innovation. John Trasvina, former general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that the initial confusion was damaging. “At first people thought existing H-1B holders would be turned away unless employers paid $100,000. Clarification came but the panic was real.” Indian IT industry body Nasscom also warned of ripple effects on U.S. competitiveness and global job markets, pointing out that many firms rely heavily on rotating skilled foreign labor into U.S. operations. While industry leaders focused on disruption and risk, the administration framed the move as a chance to redirect opportunities toward U.S. citizens and strengthen the domestic workforce. Microsoft had already announced more than 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 6,000 in May and another 9,000 in July. Across the broader industry, more than 144,900 tech workers have been laid off in over 500 separate events this year, according to TrueUp. Meta, Google, Intel and Amazon all contributed heavily to those totals. While the CompTIA unemployment report shows tech unemployment at 2.8% compared to 4.3% for the overall U.S. labor force, those percentages mask the scale of disruption. Tens of thousands of highly skilled engineers and cybersecurity professionals remain on the sidelines. This sudden policy shifts the spotlight toward that available domestic workforce. Federal agencies have also been shrinking as part of efficiency drives tied to the Department of Government Efficiency. Government bodies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security have already let go of highly trained cybersecurity staff. Many of those workers are cleared and trained yet now find themselves searching for new opportunities. This policy creates pressure and incentive to reabsorb those citizens into private sector cyber roles where they are badly needed. The fee represents a costly inconvenience for large technology companies, but many can absorb it. For startups and mid-sized firms, the burden may be crushing. Some may choose to relocate development offshore, an option that creates new risks. Innovation in AI, cloud and advanced data science could slow if fewer foreign graduates enter the U.S. market. Worse, cybersecurity work, such as Security Operating Centers, moved offshore is a dangerous recipe for the United States and businesses in general. Protecting critical infrastructure and government systems requires U.S. citizens working on U.S. soil. Moving those functions abroad undermines security and invites potential insider threats from hostile actors. Federal downsizing has already put thousands of cleared cyber professionals out of work. This creates both a problem and an opportunity. On one hand, budget cuts may have weakened agencies responsible for defending critical infrastructure. On the other, the sudden availability of highly trained citizens means private companies now have access to talent that can be integrated into private cyber operations. This policy directly channels employers toward that workforce, strengthening national security by ensuring that sensitive work is handled by Americans. The Trump administration views this move as a way to accomplish multiple goals. It forces companies to prioritize U.S. citizens and laid-off federal workers. It raises the cost of relying on foreign labor and discourages abuse of the H-1B system. It strengthens national security by ensuring that cyber roles are staffed by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, where clearance processes are more reliable and insider threats are less likely. The policy also generates new revenue that can support reskilling programs, STEM education and veteran transition initiatives. Just as importantly, it aligns with broader efforts like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, which require defense contractors to meet strict security and compliance standards by Nov. 10, 2025. By prioritizing U.S. workers and cleared personnel, companies can more easily meet CMMC requirements while reducing risk across the defense industrial base. The risks are equally clear. If retraining programs and certification pathways are not expanded quickly, many open roles will remain unfilled. Startups and immigrant-founded companies could falter or shift overseas. America’s global reputation as the preferred destination for top technical talent could decline. There are also legal questions about whether the executive branch has the authority to impose such sweeping fees and how “national interest exceptions” will be applied. At the same time, the opportunity is real. Tens of thousands of unemployed U.S. tech and cyber professionals are available and ready. This policy could open doors for them to reenter the workforce at higher wages and with greater stability. Whether this becomes a national advantage or a national setback depends entirely on whether America invests quickly and decisively in training, placement and domestic talent pipelines. The $100,000 H-1B fee is one of the boldest shifts in high-skill immigration policy in decades. It came without warning and blindsided even the largest players in the industry. The winners will be companies that already rely on U.S. citizens and have strong domestic pipelines. The losers may be startups, global firms dependent on H-1B talent and foreign nationals who had hoped to contribute to the American economy. At its core, this is not just about fees. It is about how America balances innovation, economic growth and national security. The immediate shock and reaction mirror what we saw with tariffs in past years. Then, as now, markets and companies panicked but eventually adapted. The real measure will be whether the United States uses this disruption as a catalyst to train, hire and secure its own workforce, including veterans and employees laid off from governmental agencies, or whether it allows opportunity to slip away.

It was a sunny day in August 2017, and CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator was beginning to think he might actually set his Manhattan office tower on fire. Dozens of powerful Nvidia GPUs were plugged into every available outlet, churning through the convoluted math required to mine cryptocurrency, and they were throwing off a ton of heat. With the air conditioning turned off for the weekend, the sixth-floor Financial District office had turned into a 130-degree hotbox. “I flipped. This wasn’t really built for this,” Intrator says. “I was just like, ‘We’ve got to go. We’ve got to go.’ ” He and his cofounders, Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee, scrambled, frantically disconnecting servers that were almost too hot to touch and loading them into a pickup truck before heading to New Jersey, where a garage properly ventilated with a gigantic exhaust fan waited to cool them. Nearly a decade later, some things haven’t changed. Intrator is still running GPUs, but on an exponentially larger scale. Now he’s got some 250,000 of them warehoused across the 33 data centers that CoreWeave operates, renting out access to their number-crunching prowess to compute-hungry customers. Once popular for rendering graphics for video games and mining crypto, GPUs (graphics processing units), commonly designed by chip giant Nvidia, have become a crucial engine for artificial intelligence. Access to them can determine a company’s fortunes, and CoreWeave, which trades on the Nasdaq, has built a $50 billion (market cap) business by becoming one of their go-to brokers, serving the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta in the race for AI ascendency. There is still the risk of fire—at least in a monetary sense. After pioneering a new kind of financing that helped CoreWeave borrow $29 billion, largely in loans backed by its GPUs, Intrator now balances shareholders’ qualms about deepening debt and widespread fears about an AI bubble with his broader ambition: to provide compute not just to the tech giants but to every company integrating AI into its operations. It’s not an unreasonable goal. In less than a decade, the Livingston, New Jersey–based business has spun up a data center empire, booking $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 (net losses: $860 million, for a negative 45% margin) and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 (net losses: $605 million, or –28%). By 2031, it hopes to bring in another $30 billion, mostly from contracts with A-list customers like IBM and Meta and a string of AI startups such as Cohere and Mistral. Its stock price has more than doubled since its March IPO, trouncing the broader Nasdaq’s return of 23.9% and minting at least five billionaires in the process. Intrator, 56, is now worth $6.7 billion, landing him on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the first time, along with cofounder Venturo, 40, who’s worth $4.2 billion. Cofounders McBee and Peter Salanki, as well as early investor Jack Cogen, are also new billionaires thanks to CoreWeave. The company’s remarkable growth has stemmed from ferocious global demand for GPUs. Startups have been strapped for those sophisticated chips since ChatGPT exploded in popularity in 2022, with even OpenAI in February delaying rolling out a major model upgrade because it ran out of chips to run it on. That means whoever has GPUs holds the keys to an enormous business opportunity: The AI cloud computing market was $230 billion in 2024 and, assuming the boom continues, is poised to explode to $400 billion by 2028, according to Wall Street analysts. “I’ve never seen a supply/demand imbalance like this in the 40 years I’ve been investing,” says Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital, which invested a total of $25 million in CoreWeave. Thanks to good instincts, a substantial appetite for risk and a dash of luck, Intrator realized early that his crypto company’s GPU stockpile could be good for more than minting tokens. A strategic relationship with Nvidia helped with the rest, positioning CoreWeave as one of the predominant cloud providers for the AI era. At first Silicon Valley investors weren’t convinced that CoreWeave could hold its own against well-capitalized cloud titans like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which remain both arch-competitors and, in some cases, important customers. “The overwhelming majority of [investors] thought we were insane,” Intrator says. Spurned by VCs, he turned to the debt markets, what he calls “East Coast money.” Top-tier private creditors like Blackstone and Magnetar financed the multibillion buildout of CoreWeave’s infrastructure so it could capitalize on AI’s insatiable appetite for compute. Debt financing also meant that Intrator and his cofounders held on to more precious equity; Intrator retains 13%, Venturo 7%. The scale is the key, Venturo says. “The capital intensity of this business is all that matters.” Critics are spooked by the $11.2 billion in debt on CoreWeave’s balance sheet. And with interest rates ranging from 7% to 15%, expenses remain high: The company spent more than $250 million paying interest on that debt last quarter on just $19 million in operating income. Plus about half of CoreWeave’s assets are GPUs, which are said to depreciate over six years—or less, now that Nvidia is upgrading its chips faster. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria doesn’t mince words: “This is a value-destructive entity.” Naysayers also point out that 62% of CoreWeave’s $1.9 billion revenue in 2024 came from one extremely large customer: Microsoft. That dependence won’t last long, though: OpenAI has committed to spending a total of $15.9 billion on CoreWeave’s infrastructure over the next five years and received a $350 million stake in the company. CoreWeave recently inked a deal to supply computing power to Google, and IBM has been using CoreWeave’s GPU clusters as well. “Our researchers can focus on the AI and less on the infrastructure,” says IBM Cloud CTO Hillery Hunter. Then there’s the existential question: Is the AI boom actually a bubble? In the first half of 2025, investors plowed $104 billion into artificial intelligence startups at towering valuations, per PitchBook, betting that AI really will turn out to be as revolutionary as the internet or the automobile and upend entire industries. That hasn’t happened yet. Despite spending billions on generative AI, many businesses haven’t seen material returns on it. Most AI companies still haven’t turned a profit. Even Sam Altman, AI’s chief carnival barker, is warning that overexuberant investors could “get burned.” That’s especially worrisome for CoreWeave, given its precarious, highly leveraged position as the industry’s premier GPU provider. Put another way: If this bubble were to pop, CoreWeave’s business would rupture along with it. Intrator’s talent for creative number crunching first emerged when he was a commodities trader at Natsource, a New York–based carbon credit trading and greenhouse gas asset mana­ger. There, from 1998 through the Enron scandal to 2014, he learned how to turn pollution into a financial instrument—just as he would later do with GPUs. After his first venture, a natural gas hedge fund, failed, Intrator and his cofounders pivoted, forming Atlantic Crypto in 2017 to mine ether. “We founded the company on a credit card,” Intrator says. “It was like, ‘Okay, I’ll buy a couple GPUs. What the hell?’ ” When crypto experienced one of its periodic crashes in 2018, the cofounders bought thousands of GPUs from miners going out of business for pennies on the dollar and raked in an estimated $80 million in revenue from mining. “Ethereum kept them alive long enough for them to make the transition to AI,” says early investor Nic Carter. Given ether’s volatility, Intrator realized the more lucrative bet was not fickle cryptocurrency but the equipment used to mine it. Their servers could be configured for different use cases: rendering 3D images, animation or early AI efforts. In 2019, they swapped out their “crappy” mining GPUs with data center–grade chips on a dollar-for-dollar basis. “Looking back on it, it was genius,” Venturo says. Their first break into AI came through a collaboration with Eleuther AI, a Washington, D.C.–based research nonprofit, in late 2021. CoreWeave shelled out $2 million to buy a bunch of Nvidia’s A100 chips and built a cluster of 96 GPUs for the organization, which was training a powerful open-source large language model. It did what Eleuther wanted but was plagued by bugs, networking issues and storage problems. At one point the nonprofit’s employees had to use an external storage device to manually offload data to ensure the system wouldn’t crash. “That was the tuition to learn how to build the infrastructure,” Intrator says. It was also a path to some early customers. Through Eleuther, CoreWeave found Stability AI, the creator of a viral early AI text-to-image generator called Stable Diffusion. That’s when Venturo saw the first outlines of an enormous business opportunity. But CoreWeave would need to double down on Nvidia’s chips to seize it. It would be “the most important thing this company is ever going to do,” he says. To buy those GPUs, CoreWeave needed cash—a lot of it, and fast. In late 2022, Evanston, Illinois–based asset mana­ger Magnetar Capital invested $100 million, giving CoreWeave the ammunition to buy thousands of Nvidia H100 chips and provide computational power for AI at scale. It later co-led a $2.3 billion round, CoreWeave’s first GPU-backed loan. Intrator’s genius: convincing Magnetar to secure the funds using the very chips he was buying as collateral. “They laid the groundwork for debt financing in the GPU space,” says Darrick Horton, CEO of cloud computing rival TensorWave. It was an unprecedented and risky move, but when Chat­GPT took AI mainstream in November 2022, Intrator’s gamble paid off. In January 2023, CoreWeave signed a $300 million deal with early AI darling Inflection to build a 22,000-GPU AI cluster, one of the world’s largest at the time. “We went from having nothing sold to having everything sold five times over,” Venturo says. By December 2022, CoreWeave had bought so many GPUs from Nvidia that its leadership took notice. The cofounders got a call out of the blue; Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wanted to talk. Twenty minutes later, they were on a Zoom call with him, pitching the cofounder of the world’s largest semiconductor company on investing in a no-name former crypto miner. Huang saw in CoreWeave an opportunity to strengthen Nvidia’s dominance in the AI market by propping up a future buyer for its complex chips that had the technical expertise to run them efficiently, Intrator says. Nvidia invested some $350 million in CoreWeave for a 5% stake (now worth $2.5 billion) and granted it “elite” status on its partner network, vaulting it to the front of the line for the company’s most cutting-edge chips. (Nvidia declined to comment for this story.) It’s quite the incestuous relationship. (Intrator prefers “symbiotic.”) Nvidia is a vendor, an investor and a customer; it has paid CoreWeave at least $320 million for its infrastructure and agreed to buy its unsold capacity through 2032. But it is by no means a relationship of equals. In fiscal 2025 (ended January), Nvidia made $72.9 billion profit on $130.5 billion revenue. Its current market capitalization exceeds $4.3 trillion. D.A. Davidson analyst Luria puts it directly: “CoreWeave wouldn’t exist if Nvidia didn’t want it to.” As CoreWeave landed larger contracts, it took on more debt to fulfill them. In 2023, it struck a deal with Microsoft, which reportedly plans to spend $10 billion on its cloud computing services through 2030. That was enough for Blackstone to lead $2.3 billion in debt financing in 2023, followed by a fatter $7.5 billion check in 2024. “We are underwriting contracts, capacity and power, not a particular ‘story,’ ” says Jas Khaira, a senior managing director at Blackstone, adding that the due diligence process ensured the contracts were airtight and customers like Microsoft couldn’t easily walk away. Inside a coolly lit data center in Orangeburg, New York, about 40 minutes north of Midtown Manhattan, rows of what look like hospital IV bags hang across long banks of densely packed black shelves. Each bag dispenses a drip of neon-green cooling fluid to a rack of GPU-filled servers when needed, keeping them at the safe, always-on temperature at which they help pay for CoreWeave’s considerable investment in them. Just how much revenue those servers can deliver depends on two things: how long AI’s demand for compute will outstrip supply and how long it will take AI companies to catch up. Microsoft, for instance, spent $88 billion on capex in the year ending June 2025, most of which was for AI infrastructure. Open AI reportedly signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle recently to provide compute—part of its President Trump–endorsed Stargate partnership—calling into question the future of its contracts with CoreWeave. Aside from the hyperscaling incumbents, CoreWeave must also battle cloud computing rivals like Crusoe, Nebius and Lambda, many of which have landed contracts with CoreWeave’s big tech clients, who use multiple cloud providers to reduce dependence on just one. “Renewal and retention is a risk,” says Macquarie analyst Paul Golding. “We think about risk in a more sophisticated way than almost anyone else in the space.” And then there’s that debt. CoreWeave has no plans to stop borrowing against its GPUs—debt could rise to $30 billion in two years, per JPMorgan projections. Some analysts are worried about the risk of doing that, especially amid ongoing net losses ($2.1 billion in total since 2023) in a fast-moving industry. Intrator has heard and dismissed all this before. “No shit, I’m borrowing money,” he says, gesticulating defiantly at his Wall Street haters while en route to CoreWeave’s Manhattan office. McBee backs him up. “There’s no risk,” he says, improbably. They claim each CoreWeave contract (average length: four years) prices in most of the costs of delivering on it—GPUs, data center buildouts and interest payments—plus depreciation and maintenance. If all goes as planned, then, CoreWeave is left with some profit plus the value of its GPUs. Generally, contracts are structured to generate approximately $2 of revenue for every dollar of debt to be repaid, McBee says. The risk, of course, is that the AI boom goes bubble and pops—and those contracts are never fulfilled, leaving CoreWeave with a ton of idle servers and a mountain of debt. Citi analyst Tyler Radke forecasts CoreWeave could be profitable as early as next year. It’s losing money because of interest payments and because infrastructure costs a lot to build upfront. “We think about risk in a more sophisticated way than almost anyone else in the space,” Intrator says. Maybe. But many credit rating agencies categorize CoreWeave’s latest bonds as junk. Even if the boom times continue, things could go south fast if the company can’t build out what it has promised, as quickly as promised. Then there are the known unknowns: regulatory hurdles, manufacturing mishaps, local opposition. Protests alone have already stopped or slowed $64 billion in data center projects, according to Data Center Watch. And CoreWeave is already facing opposition over a new facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where it’s investing $6 billion. When it’s finished, it is expected to consume four times as much power as all the region’s homes, says Lancaster resident Emma Burgess. Residents of the community known for its Amish history recently packed city council meetings to voice their concerns: too little community input, too much electricity, too much pollution (both air and noise). McBee says there hasn’t been pushback at the site, but acknowledges “you’re gonna break things along the way.” Because CoreWeave’s AI data centers need to be on 24/7/365, they can’t be subject to the fluctuations that come with wind and solar power. So for the time being “it’s gas,” McBee says. “That’s what we prefer.” In May, CoreWeave acquired AI software developer Weights & Biases for $1 billion, a deal it hopes will diversify its customer base. A planned $9 billion acquisition of data center owner Core Scientific—which could bring some 1.5 gigawatts of additional contracted power—would more than quadruple CoreWeave’s current active power, provided regulators and shareholders allow it. Next up: investing in AI startups with a combo of cash and GPU access. Things are volatile. CoreWeave’s market cap has swung by some $70 billion since its rocky March IPO. Tariffs could further unsettle its bottom line. Its biggest customer just signed a huge deal with a rival fast encroaching on its turf. Delays, of both capital and equipment, could kill CoreWeave’s head start. None of this has fazed Intrator, who’s confident his GPU-backed debt will pay off and keep his company growing alongside rampant demand for AI compute. As the markets rise, so too will CoreWeave, buoyed by the prescient bets that made it a $50 billion behemoth in just six years. But it’s still beholden to the biggest gamble of all—that the AI bubble won’t burst. This story has been updated to clarify a statement about Microsoft’s projected capital expenditures.

Title: What’s Up with the Crazy Flow Volatility at ARK’s ETFs?

Competing theories have been proposed to explain why billions of dollars have gone into and out of several ARK ETFs in recent weeks. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Something strange has been happening to several of ARK’s ETFs recently: Assets have been spiking like blood sugar after a pumpkin spice latte. There has been speculation about the causes, but no one, other than the unidentified traders, knows why. One explanation is that the activity is merely heartbeat trades that were used to wash taxes. Another is that a zealous bunch of retail investors wanted exposure to a few IPOs. But the most interesting theory, from the Financial Times’ Robin Wigglesworth, is that someone gamed the creation and redemption process to ultimately pocket a cool $21 million in just a matter of days. Just before the Bullish IPO in August, someone could have borrowed shares of constituent stocks that are in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and used the holdings to create about 70 million ETF shares, Wigglesworth wrote. After ARKK bought Bullish shares in the IPO, the person or group seemingly redeemed their ETF shares for the constituents, able to then sell the Bullish stock at a premium, he said. A twist is that the same thing appeared to have happened ahead of Klarna’s Sept. 10 IPO, “with one crucial, hilarious twist … ARKK didn’t actually invest in the Klarna IPO!” Wigglesworth noted. If the theory is correct, it would be an uncommon approach to profiting within ETFs, said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities. Many ETFs don’t buy stocks at the time of an IPO, he said. “This activity is happening outside the fund in the primary market through the APs/market makers; they are bearing the cost of the activity.” Other ETF shareholders are insulated from the effects of such tactics, he said. Regardless of what’s happening, it’s interesting. “It’s an incredibly unique situation,” Morningstar principal US equity strategist Robby Greengold said. “Three of ARK’s ETFs have been swept up in these violent flow patterns that don’t really happen anywhere else. This is fascinating to watch unfold, but it’s also extremely difficult to know who’s behind it.” There is a potential downside for other investors in the ARK funds, as the ETFs significantly increased their cash allocations after the share creations. The flow activities showed dramatic changes: Low Point in the Arc: As of Friday, the data didn’t show a massive exit from ARKK, and what’s happening isn’t clear. ARK did not comment on any of the recent flow activity. “Effectively, it’s dilutive to any of ARK’s pre-existing fund holders,” Greengold said of the big fluctuations that hiked cash allocations. “That post-IPO pop wasn’t felt as strongly as it otherwise would have been.” The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. The Federal Reserve’s decision may not have been a surprise, but ripple effects are already being felt across the industry. Generic listing standards for crypto exchange-traded products could open the floodgates for ETPs beyond spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Palantir Wants to Be a Lifestyle Brand
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-wants-to-be-a-lifestyle-brand/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T10:00:00Z

Palantir Technologies, which moved from Silicon Valley to Denver in 2020, sells software that immigration authorities use to identify and arrest people, militaries use to organize drone strikes, and corporations use to manage their supply chains. Now, it also sells tote bags. Last year, Palantir relaunched an online merchandise store, and its website was recently redesigned with a swanky interface and new payment system. A mock terminal in the lower left corner displays “code” documenting each item you view. A page titled “Core Capsule” displays an assortment of sold out items, like athletic shorts with text reading "PLTR—TECH" running down the right butt cheek, which sold for $99. It also shows a puffy “ergonomic" nylon tote bag that was priced at $119, and a Palantir baseball cap that ran for $55. The site is relaunching on Thursday evening with a new merch drop. Many companies produce branded swag for their employees and clients, including the legacy defense contractors that Palantir is trying to disrupt. Lockheed Martin sells a skunk stuffed animal, a nod to its R&D team that started secret operations under the name “Skunk Works” during World War II. Boeing sells T-shirts and keychains depicting various military aircraft, like its B-52 bomber jets and AH-64 attack helicopters. They’re products that may appeal to current or former employees, or their friends and family. But what Palantir is doing feels far more ambitious: The company seemingly wants to be a lifestyle brand. Eliano Younes—the company's head of strategic engagement, who runs the merch store and posts about it frequently on X—has been explicit about this in multiple posts. “Palantir is THE lifestyle brand,” Younes posted on X in March. “The most pro-west, meritocratic, winning obsessed, and based brand on the face of the earth.” But what does it mean for Palantir—a company that, in the words of one former employee, essentially sells digital “filing cabinets” to customers like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, Heineken beer, and General Mills—to be a lifestyle brand? Lifestyle brands sell products that people buy to express their identities, whether they’re Tesla super fans, Zyn bros, or Hydroflask water bottle girlies. These brands aren’t necessarily successful because they have a superior product, but rather because they’re skilled at “proposing an original point of view” and “influencing a social context,” argues the book Lifestyle Brands, cowritten by management professor Stefania Saviolo and brand consultant Antonio Marazza. Using the products they sell is a symbolic act, a way to “to signal status” or demonstrate “a sense of belonging to a group.” Generally, lifestyle brands are known for products they sell to the public. People recognize Tesla as a company that sells cars, and Zyn as a company that sells nicotine pouches. To state the obvious, Palantir is not a clothing company. And the software it does sell is not consumer-facing. Its price tag is so large that, often, giant government agencies and corporations are the only ones that can afford it. Palantir is not exactly an obvious candidate for a lifestyle brand. And yet, despite the odds, Palantir has a fan base that includes many potential merch customers. Palantir bros are not hard to encounter online: There are several Palantir-focused subreddits, the largest of which has 109,000 members. Some people on X have been able to amass huge followings by posting exclusively about the company throughout the day. Palantir fans can obsessively focus on the company’s stock price. They can behave like American football fans when it goes up, celebrating as if their team scored a touchdown. When it gets a big contract, it’s as if their team got a new star player. In this context, it makes sense that people would want to purchase merch—it’s like buying a jersey. Palantir’s fan base gradually expanded during the years that contractors for immigration enforcement and the military were least popular in Silicon Valley. For fans, Palantir was a contrarian dark horse that stood by its principles, even though others detested them. For Palantir, becoming a lifestyle brand seems more about getting the company’s fans to publicly identify with its brand and its mission. This is made explicit on a white note card, with CEO Alex Karp’s signature, that was included with recent orders of Palantir merch. “Thank you for your dedication to Palantir and our mission to defend the West,” the card reads. “The future belongs to those who believe and build. And we build to dominate.” Younes has expressed a similar sentiment. “Palantir isn't just a software company,” he wrote on X in August. “It’s a world view—western values, pro-warfighter, problem solving, conviction, dominant software, etc. that’s why people rep the gear.” These values have not always been popular in Silicon Valley. In fact, historically, they’ve been outright rejected. In 2018, thousands of Google workers rallied against the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon project analyzing drone footage with AI. Conceding to the workers, Google chose to not renew its Maven contract but said it wouldn’t stop working with the Pentagon. That same year, protests against Palantir were popping up in Palo Alto in response to the company’s work with ICE. (ICE did not cancel any contracts.) However, under the second Trump administration, the tech world is beginning to openly embrace aligning with the military—both transactionally, and symbolically. In June, the Army commissioned an elite group of tech executives to be “lieutenant colonels.” Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar was joined by Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil, and current Thinking Machines Lab adviser and former OpenAI chief research officer Bob McGrew, who also worked at Palantir. Palantir’s current merch store appears to capitalize on this vibe change and communicate that the company is doubling down on its reputation, branding, and mission. In an April letter to shareholders, Karp wrote that its mission “was for years dismissed as politically fraught and ill-advised.” “We, the heretics, this motley band of characters, were cast out and nearly discarded by Silicon Valley,” Karp wrote. “And yet there are signs that some within the Valley have now turned a corner and begun following our lead.” One of Palantir’s first merch releases was a black shirt with a giant red graphic. The oblong shape resembles an oval projection of the earth. There are three lines inside the oval that evoke latitude-longitude lines, or a wireframe globe. In the direct center, there’s the Palantir logo. Symbolically, it looks like Palantir is controlling the world. Ironically, one of the most common misconceptions about Palantir is that it’s one giant database with information from every single one of its clients. The company has published several blogs trying to dispel this myth on a factual basis. This shirt, by contrast, appears to take a different approach. It symbolically mocks, embraces, and dismisses this misconception. It seemingly was created with precisely Karp’s “heretics” in mind. At the core of Palantir’s merch identity is its insistence that all of the products are “Made in the U.S.A.” Like many other companies, Palantir wants to evoke a sense of pride in supporting American workers. But it’s very expensive to produce clothes made in the United States—especially ones with custom tags and high-quality materials, as the company claims. Palantir’s head of strategic development has said that the goal of the merch store, financially, is to simply break even. When the website relaunched, Younes blamed tariffs for the higher cost of the merchandise. “This will not be a new revenue stream,” he posted in May 2024. Simply put, Palantir doesn't have to do this. In fact, Palantir has actually tried and failed to run a merch store before. Archives of the old store show a simple white website with nondescript T-shirts and hats. At the time, some customers complained that they were cheaply made and unattractive. Palantir shut it down in 2023. Palantir isn’t alone. The defense tech company Anduril, which is known for embracing working with US immigration authorities early in its history, launched a “gear store” shortly after Palantir relaunched its own. It sells shiny black flight jackets, Hawaiian shirts (not unlike the ones CEO Palmer Luckey is known to sport), and T-shirts that say “workatanduril.com” in black sans serif text overlain with “DON’T” scrawled in black graffiti, seemingly in an attempt to look rebellious and cheeky. Like Palantir, the company is eager to note when its products are “Made in the USA.” WIRED was unable to independently confirm details about the production of Palantir and Anduril merch, including whether it was made in America, or which manufacturers they used. Neither company responded to a request for comment on the topic. Garments made in the US are typically made by immigrants, which make up more than 40 percent of the workforce. Many of them are undocumented, and can be compensated by tasks completed rather than being paid by the hour, which overwhelmingly adds up to far below the minimum wage. Palantir has been doing a lot of work for ICE under Trump 2.0. Since April, it has been building “ImmigrationOS,” a new system for the agency to, ideally, have “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting. (Public documents are not clear about how ImmigrationOS would do this, or what data it would use.) ICE is paying Palantir $30 million to do this. Palantir is scheduled to provide ICE with a prototype of ImmigrationOS on September 25. On September 18, it released new merch.

Title: Google Pixel 10 Pro XL Review
URL: https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/android/google-pixel/326951/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-review
Time Published: 2025-09-21T18:05:06Z
Full Content:
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest of the new Pixel smartphones and it is chock full of useful AI features. But the camera system and Pixelsnap/Qi 2.2 are what put this phone over the top. Google has been on a well-deserved victory tour since it unleashed its modern camera bar-centric hardware design with the Pixel 6 series in 2021. Since then, we saw meaningful evolutions in the Pixel 7 and 8 series, and then a major redesign with the Pixel 9 series centered on its newly floating and curved camera bar. Well, that design was so good that Google is using it again for the Pixel 10 series with just some minor iterative changes. That will bore some, I suppose, but it was the right decision. Google hit a home run with this design a year ago, and it’s as fresh and unique as ever. Heck, even Apple is copying it with the new camera “plateau” on the iPhone 17 series. Apple knows good design when it sees it. Like the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has shiny metal sides that look wonderful but pick up fingerprints a bit too easily. And there’s a nice matte back, which I very much prefer to the glossy Pixel 10 back, with a larger “G” logo in the center of the hidden Pixelsnap magnetic charging ring. That said, it’s still slippery, so you’ll want a case. As with the previous several Pixel generations, the camera bar is beautiful and functional: Unlike most rival flagship smartphones, you can lay the Pixel 10 Pro XL down on a table or other surface and use it without fear of wobbling. Though the Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro XL are the same size—6.4 x 3 x 0.3 inches—and roughly the same weight (the 10 Pro XL is a bit heavier, at 8.2 ounces–there are subtle physical differences. For example, the camera bar is a bit taller and wider this year and that G logo on the back is bigger. (Yes, that means you can’t move cases between the two phones.) The Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch Super Actua-branded LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) OLED display panel with a native resolution of 1344 x 2992 (486 PPI), a 9:20 aspect ratio, a variable refresh rate of 1 Hz to 120 Hz (that’s what LTPO does), and a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio that emits 2200 nits of brightness for HDR content and a peak brightness of 3300 nits. It supports HDR and 24-bit color, and it’s covered in Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass protection. This display is virtually identical to the display on last year’s Pixel 9 Pro XL. The only difference is that the brightness and peak brightness levels are both 10 percent higher on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That should provide a small improvement in direct sunlight, but I never detected any major differences. Which is fine: This is a fantastic display, with rich colors and excellent details, even though it uses a lower-resolution of 1080 x 2404 by default to help spare the battery. This was not an issue on the Pixel 9 Pro XL so I left it on its default here as well. Adaptive brightness used to be problematic on Pixel phones, with several generations routinely dimming the screen below a comfortable level. But this is no longer an issue: As with its predecessor, I never once had to manually adjust the brightness. Google uses a punch hole cutout for the self camera, which I prefer over other positions, though it seems a bit large to me. Speaking of which, I think we’re at the point where we can’t really describe the display bezels as small. If anything they’re particularly noticeable with a case on the phone. Not objectionable in any way, of course. But noticeable. The gentle curves in the corner are nicely done, as before. And the Color contrast and Colors options are unchanged year-over-year. But I love the new screensaver feature that turns the phone into a mini-smart display when it’s not used and connected to power. This pairs nicely with the new Pixelsnap powered accessories and turns the Pixel 10 Pro XL into a neat bedside companion. With the Pixel 10 series, Google is moving to its 5th generation Tensor processor, which is based on a smaller and more efficient 3 nm manufacturing process, compared to 4 nm for the Pixel 9 series. It’s also faster, Google says, with a 34 percent gain in CPU performance and 60 percent in TPU (NPU) performance. That’s impressive, but that’s compared to the Tensor G4, and Google’s processors have never threatened Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon chips or Apple Silicon in raw performance. Yes, that is by design: Google optimizes the Tensor for its on-device AI workloads. And with the Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10 series, there are several new AI features that exist because of the improvements Google made to this chip. (More on that below.) The Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with 16 GB of RAM, the same as last year. But there are two interesting changes with the storage. The 128 GB option is gone, as it should be, with Google now offering 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB storage options. And the storage is faster. Where the Pixel 9 Pro XL utilized UFS 3.1 storage, the Pixel 10 Pro XL moves up to UFS 4.0 on the 256 GB configuration and Zoned UFS 4.0 on the 512 GB and 1 TB configurations. Whether there’s any real-world benefit to either upgrade is unclear, and I don’t have a phone to test that. But Zone UFS apparently adapts the layout of items in storage over time to optimize access speeds. And that’s the thing. In day-to-day use, the Pixel 10 Pro XL worked well, and I’ve never noticed any slowdowns, pauses, or glitches. This was true of the previous device as well, but the more efficient Tensor G5 runs cooler than its predecessor, and that leads to lower temperatures in use. And that is something I have noticed: On multiple drives with the Pixel 10 Pro XL exposed on the car’s dashboard for hours at a time, I noticed it getting warm but not overly hot. I’ve seen the Pixel 9 Pro XL switch to dark mode and issue warnings because of overheating in this scenario, so this is a worthwhile improvement. I also tested Call of Duty: Mobile on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, using the higher resolution graphical assets and an Xbox Wireless Controller, and it played perfectly, with no heat build-up or performance issues at all. The Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth v6, the latter of which is a first for me. It supports all the Gs (to speak) for broadband cellular, of course, including 5G with mmWave + Sub6GHz, though the little window for that in the top of the Pixel 9 Pro XL is no longer present this year. I use Google Fi for cellular, and I switched over my phone number to the Pixel 10 Pro XL and used it in Pennsylvania and in Berlin, Germany and never had any issues. Note that if you live in the U.S., Google is no longer providing a nano-SIM tray. Instead, you can store 8 eSIMs and have two active at a time. I think we’re at the point where going all-eSIM is the way to go, so I have no issues there. As with its predecessor, the Pixel 10 Pro XL provides a terrific multimedia experience thanks to its support for HDR+ and stereo speakers. Video looks terrific, and the selfie camera punch hole seems to disappear as you pay attention to the content. Interestingly, the stereo sound appears to be better balanced this year: The left (top) speaker is part of the earpiece and tends to be less loud on most phones, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL, giving sound a bit of a right bias. But that’s much less pronounced with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. And the speakers get loud, without any distortion, though you get some case vibration and echo at 100 percent volume. The Pixel 10 Pro XL supports spatial audio but only via compatible earbuds. I purchased a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds that do support this feature, along with head-tracking. I will review those separately, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a nice combination for gaming, listening, or viewing on the go. The Pixel 10 Pro XL provides a terrific three-lens rear camera system, though it’s nearly identical to what we got last year in the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This time around, the major advances come from AI, a Google strength, with unique capabilities that in some cases are unlocked by the Pixel’s Tensor G5 processor. This makes sense. The Pixel lineup has focused on computational photography since the original release in 2016, and fans typically cite photography as a key factor in their buying decisions. So no one will be surprised to learn that the Pixel 10 Pro XL gives users an ideal camera system. And that’s true whether you just take point-and-click snapshots as I typically do, or you’re a professional who requires the pro controls that the Pixel 10 Pro XL also provides. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is now my favorite smartphone for photography. It provides the best overall camera system of the phones I’ve used, and it delivers consistently predictable high quality regardless of the conditions. This is an important point. It’s possible to take incredible photos with a flagship iPhone, but you have to babysit every shot to make sure the result it exactly what you want. With Pixel, this is automatic. So let’s start with the hardware. As noted, there are three camera lenses on the rear of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and they’re housed as before inside the stunning rounded camera bar at the top of the phone. The main (wide) lens is a 25 mm equivalent with 50 MP of resolution, and 82-degree field of view (FOV), an f/1.68 aperture, dual-pixel phase detection (PDAF), optical image stabilization (OIS), and electronic image stabilization (EIS). Google says that the OIS has been enhanced this year, resulting in smoother, less jittery video recordings. The ultra-wide lens is a 13 mm equivalent with 48 MP of resolution, a 123-degree FOV, an f/2.8 aperture, dual-pixel PDAF, and auto-focus. Edge distortion is minimal, and while this is subtle, these photos are less distorted at the edges than the ultra-wide shots the smaller Pixel 10 shoots. The periscope telephoto lens is a 113 mm equivalent with 48 MP of resolution, a 22-degree FOV, an f/2.8 aperture, dual-pixel PDAF, OIS, EIS, and 5x optical zoom. I was surprised that Google didn’t up the optical zoom to 8x in this release, but the telephoto lens now supports Super Res Zoom (using machine learning) to 29x and Pro Res Zoom (using generative AI) from 30x to 100x. And this change is the single biggest—and best—improvement in the Pixel 10 Pro XL camera system. I wrote about the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s telephoto capabilities in Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Camera Deep Dive (Premium), but the short version is that Pro Res Zoom works, and most of the time, it works quite well. Where previous Pixel flagships could theoretically capture images at up to 30x using Super Res Zoom, I experienced declining quality north of 20x and usually tried to limit myself to that. But the Pixel 10 Pro XL delivers very good quality to about 70x when taking photos by hand, instead of using a tripod. And even 100x is doable if you choose the right subject—buildings and other well-defined objects are a good choice—and can counter the movement in the viewfinder. To be clear, there are caveats: The generative AI capabilities of Pro Res Zoom work best with certain subjects and this is one instance in which it’s wise to take multiple shots and babysit the results a bit, as I always do with the iPhone. Less obviously, Pro Res Zoom requires you to stick to the default 12 MP resolution setting for photos; if you choose to shoot at full-resolution (typically 50 MP), the Pixel works as it did before and offers Super Res Zoom up to 30x instead. That’s not an issue for me, as I do stick with the defaults having experimented with full-resolution shots. And you can always save photos as JPEGs and RAW files, which will give you more editing controls, though at the lower resolution in both cases. I was curious whether the Pixel 10 Pro XL with Pro Res Zoom could outperform recent Samsung Galaxy S Ultra models, which can deliver incredible long-distance shots. And that’s hit or miss: Thanks to some chicanery, my wife’s Galaxy S24 Ultra delivers crisp, clear moon photos that I could never duplicate with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. But when comparing the phones during the day, the Pixel often did a better job of summoning details—or creating them, I guess—at very high zoom levels, where the Samsung just delivered a muddy mess. Put simply, these long distance zoom shots were the one area where Pixel fell short of the most expensive Galaxy handsets. But that’s not the case anymore. The front selfie camera is a single 17 mm equivalent ultra-wide lens with 42 MP of resolution, a 103-degree FOV, an f/2.2 aperture, and PDAF. This appears unchanged year-over-year, and it offers the same 0.7x and 1x zoom controls to take advantage of its wide field-of-view. I’m not much of a selfie taker, but this lens works as automatically and consistently well as the rear camera system. And there’s a neat palm timer feature that lets you use the camera normally, with no timer, but start a 3-second timer countdown on the fly by placing your palm in front of the camera to give yourself a moment to frame the shot correctly. That’s a terrific idea, and it works with the rear camera as well, though I never found a use for it there. Not surprisingly, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is packed with helpful camera and photography features. Here, I will focus on the new and improved features. Beginners can use the Camera Coach to get AI-based recommendations for framing a shot on the fly and other suggestions. (You can learn more about this in Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Camera Coach, but it’s surprisingly useful.) And there’s a new “Help me edit” feature that lets you use natural language to tell Google Photos how you want a photo to be edited. (I can’t take a screenshot of this at the moment because this feature is U.S. only and I’m in Mexico as I write this. Doy.) Panorama shots now work with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s 5x optical zoom plus the Camera app’s Shadows, Exposure, White Balance, and Focus controls for the first time. If you choose to shoot at native resolution, you can also get up to 100 MP images now in this mode. You can use Google’s Veo 3 AI model to make short video clips from any photo in Google Photos. The results are always impressive, and sometimes eerily so, with people in photos moving in space, looking at each, and interacting naturally. You can learn more about my experiences with the Pixel 10 Pro XL camera system in Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Completing Setup, First AI and Photo Experiences and Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Camera Deep Dive (Premium). But my initial worries that the minor hardware upgrades would result in an off year are unfounded. The Pixel 10 Pro XL takes absolutely fantastic photos across the board. I will be examining its video capabilities soon in that Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries series as well. While I still feel that the Face ID system Apple provides with the iPhone is the fastest and most reliable biometric authentication system on mobile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL acquits itself nicely in this category as well. It offers Face Unlock and Fingerprint Unlock, the latter via an ultrasonic fingerprint reader under the display, and both work well, though Face Unlock is useless in anything other than good lighting and it doesn’t like sunglasses. I also configured my Pixel Watch 3 to unlock the phone, which adds another level of convenience. (Yes, an Apple Watch works similarly with the iPhone.) I just want to get into the phone, no matter the lighting, as quickly as possible, and while still maintaining an acceptable level of security. As with the previous few Pixel generations, Google outfits the Pixel 10 Pro XL with its Titan M2 security processor with Trusty (Trusted Execution Environment) and anti-malware and anti-phishing protection. VPN by Google is free to Pixel customers. It’s not particularly configurable, you can just toggle it on or off, and it’s a bit difficult to find because it’s part of the Settings app. But it’s a nice perk that works system-wide and supports per-app exclusions and automatic pausing on selected networks. And there is a handy Quick setting in the Notification shade once you figure out it’s there. The Pixel 10 Pro XL gets 7 years of OS and security updates. I would never use a phone that long, but that support lifecycle is as good as it gets in mobile. Tensor-based Pixels have always offered average battery life compared to the latest iPhones and most Samsung flagships. (The Galaxy S25+ and Edge being key exceptions.) That trend continues with the Pixel 10 series: You should be able to get through an average day without worrying about the battery, as I did. But if you’re taking a lot of photos, while on vacation, perhaps, or just out in the world using Google Maps, Uber, or whatever else more than usual, you’ll want to bring a charger. Or better yet, a Pixelsnap wireless charger. In the good news department, charging speeds are nicely improved: The Pixel 10 Pro XL can charge its 5200m Ah battery at up to 45 watts over USB-C now, with a compatible charger (not included in the box), and it can achieve a nearly 70 charge in just 30 minutes. And using a compatible Pixelsnap/Qi 2.2 wireless charger, you can charge at up to 25 watts. By comparison, the Pixel 9 Pro XL could charge its slightly smaller 5060 mAh battery at up to 37 watts over USB, 23 watts wirelessly using a proprietary (non-Qi) PixelStand, or 15 watts using Qi. But previous-generation Pixels also lack the Pixelsnap/Qi 2.2 magnets and MagSafe compatibility. There is one downside to the addition of MagSafe/Qi 2.2: Unlike its predecessor, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, like the other Pixel 10 series phones, does not support reverse wireless charging. The most profound hardware upgrade with the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the addition of Qi 2.2 wireless charging, which opens up these phones to the wonderful ecosystem of MagSafe-compatible peripherals as well as Google’s new Pixelsnap-branded accessories. Qi 2.2 makes wireless charging even better, with up to 25 watts of charging power and magnets in the phone and in compatible peripherals ensuring fast charging speeds and a solid connection. I’ve used the Pixel 10 Pro XL with several Qi 2.x/MagSafe-compatible peripherals, most recently the mini MagSafe tripod that I keep here in Mexico. And this feature is a game changer. It’s not the reason to buy a Pixel 10 series phone, but it is absolutely a reason. As is the incredible software that Google provides on these handsets. The Pixel 10 Pro XL shipped with a highly optimized Android 16 and the Quarter Platform Release 1 (QPR1) update, which includes the delightful Material Expressive 3 design throughout the system and, increasingly, in Google’s in-box apps. This is a far more successful and far less controversial make-over than Apple’s Liquid Glass. It’s not just attractive, it also enhances usability with new control styles that can expand and grow to better work with your fingers. It’s like Liquid Glass without the Glass. You can see the impact of Material Expressive 3 throughout the Pixel user experience. The lock screen can be customized with fun 3D motion effects, similar to what Apple offers, but also unique shape and weather effects. The always-on display can now optionally display the lock screen wallpaper with a nice dimmed and blurred effect. You can add a new calling card to any contact, providing a gorgeous full-screen experience when that person calls you on the phone. There’s a new Screen saver feature that displays a smart display-like screen when the Pixel is charging. It works in portrait and landscape modes, supports clock, weather, and photo slideshow views, and thanks to its low-light mode, it’s a neat thing to have if you keep the phone by your bedside. Some Material Expressive 3 tweaks are minor, like the on-screen volume controls and the newly colorful Settings app. But some are more in your face, like the quick settings tiles in the Notification shade. They’re fully customizable now and can be resized between squircles or rounded rectangles, and repositioned as needed, and there’s an incredible range of tiles you can add to make this interface your own. This is nicely done. Google markets Pixel as the helpful phone, and that can be seen throughout the software that it provides on these devices. And while AI has always been core to the value proposition, its use has exploded in recent years, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL delivers the most impressive set of end-to-end solutions yet. Just listing all these features would be problematic, and fully documenting them would require a book-length work. But I will try to provide a reasonable overview of the new features here, with the understanding that this all builds on years of work making these phones helpful in meaningful ways. First up, all Pixel 10 series customers get one year of Google AI Pro for free, providing you with 2 TB of Google Drive storage, access to Google’s most advanced Gemini models, and higher usage limits across the board. This is a nice perk, and it makes the Gemini app on the Pixel 10 Pro XL far more powerful and useful. For example, you can use Deep Research to create reports grounded in hundreds of websites or documents. And you can use the in-box NotebookLM app to organize notes and other information and learn more about particular topics. Gemini is now the default personal assistant on the new Pixels, replacing the Google Assistant, and it supports Gemini Live for ongoing conversations with the assistant and learning more about what you see on the screen, including through the Camera app’s viewfinder. I’m still trying to get comfortable with this type of functionality, but there’s no denying its usefulness: You can learn more about anything you’re looking at, whether it’s a business or other site out in the world or any item. It’s been incredibly accurate: When I pointed it at our Bluetooth speaker and asked what it was, Gemini correctly identified it as a JBL Charge 5, not just a JBL or JBL Charge speaker. And you can trigger Gemini Live by pressing and holding on the Pixel’s power button, which is handy. Magic Cue could emerge as a marquee new feature on the Pixel 10 series, though it’s limited for now and will expand dramatically over time. Put simply, Magic Cue works with a customizable list of compatible apps—Contacts, Google Calendar, Gmail, Keep Notes, Messages, and Pixel Screenshots for now—and surfaces relevant information proactively as you use the phone. I’ve seen Magic Cue pop-up most frequently in Messages. For example, if my wife asks me about dinner reservations via text, Magic Cue displays a little bubble under the question in Messages that lists the date, time, and place I saved that information in Calendar. This works similarly for questions about flight times, another contact’s phone number, and the like. Voice Translate works like Conversation mode in the Google Translate app but using the Phone app instead. I’ve not tested this yet, but now that we’re in Mexico I will almost certainly have the opportunity to use it in a real-world scenario. Basically, you make a phone call and enable Voice Translate (via Call Assist), and the Pixel alerts both parties about what it’s doing. Then, both people speak normally and each hears the speech using their native language. There’s a new Pixel Journal for jotting down thoughts and other things as they occur, but some of the existing Pixel-exclusive apps get exciting new features this year as well. For example, the Recorder app is already incredible, providing transcripts that identify each speaker, a feature I used for this article during a meeting with Lenovo. But now it also creates music for you on the fly using its recordings, which is pretty freaky. To test this, I cropped that meeting recording (it has to be 3 minutes long or less), selected “Create music” from the “More” (“…”) menu, and then chose the “Rainy day” vibe from a long list of choices. It analyzed the recording, worked its magic, and then created a version of the meeting recording with background guitars timed to the speech. Gboard is Google’s virtual keyboard and it’s been enhanced with Writing Tools to fix writing mistakes like grammar, typing, and punctuation on the fly and the ability to edit voice-dictated messages using natural voice commands. That latter feature is useful for those like me who rely on dictating by voice. For example, when I said the word “Rubi,” which is a bar and restaurant here in Mexico City, Gboard wrote that as “Ruby,” so I then said, “Change Ruby to Rubi with an I,” and it made that change. (That said, it was less successful with “Form + Matter,” which couldn’t get past “plus sign.”) And Pixel Studio, Google’s text-to-image creation utility, has been updated to use Imagen 4, the latest version of this model, plus new fonts, stickers, and other graphical assets. The results are impressive, and it supports a long list of styles so you can customize each creation accordingly. The Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at $1199, which is $100 more than the starting price of its predecessor. But not really: The base Pixel 10 Pro XL now comes with 256 GB, not 128 GB as before, and so it’s the same price for that amount of storage. You can choose 512 GB and 1 TB configurations for $1319 and $1549, respectively, and choose between four colors: Moonstone (a sort of medium gray-blue), Jade (a light green with gold accents), Porcelain (which is similar to Apple’s Starlight, a champagne-like color), and Obsidian (black). Unfortunately, not all color choices come in all the available storage configurations. And as bad, the base model is the same price as the base model iPhone 17 Pro Max. Fortunately, Apple’s storage upgrades are more expensive—$1399 and $1599, respectively—though one can also get an iPhone with 2 TB of storage for $1999. Yikes. The review unit that Google lent me came in Moonstone. I would have personally chosen Porcelain, not that it matters, since I would never spend this much money on a phone, a device this clumsy human carries with him everywhere he goes all day long every day, and not use a protective case. Which will add another $50 to the purchase price if you go with the stock Google Pixelsnap Case, as I did. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL consistently takes the best photos of any smartphone I’ve used, and it’s packed to the gills with truly useful features that surface almost every time I unlock it. The display is nearly perfect, Google seems to have gotten in front of the heat issues from previous Tensor-based Pixels, and the support lifecycle is the best in the industry. Yes, it’s big and heavy, but so are the flagships from Apple and Samsung. Less defensible is the pricing, which I feel should undercut the competition. But Google offers solid trade-ins to owners of previous Pixels, and that will help soften the blow. My Pixel 9 Pro XL with 128 GB of storage is worth $413 on trade right now, but it was worth $600 at launch and Google will likely raise trade-in values again at Black Friday and other promotional times. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is highly recommended.

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

The Fed is back to cutting rates. What'll it do next? We'll learn more this week. After last week's decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time this year, market watchers will be eager for clues about whether more cuts are in store in the coming months. Several data points due this week should offer insight. Stocks ended last week on the rise, with all three major U.S. indexes finishing at record highs. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure comes as policymakers watch for evidence that tariffs are working their way into consumer prices. A string of Fed officials will deliver remarks over the course of the week investors will parse for hints about the possibility of further cuts at this year's two remaining meetings. The final revision to second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) will also be in focus, as will data on home sales, jobless claims, and consumer sentiment. Traders will be watching for earnings from chipmaker Micron, retailer Costco, and used car seller CarMax. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index for August is set to be released on Friday. PCE inflation held relatively steady in July after accelerating in June. Friday's report will be the first reading on prices since Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that elevated inflation and a weakening labor market give policymakers "no risk-free path" forward. The Fed has projected that it’s likely to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings, but Powell said officials will be closely watching economic readings before making further moves. Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar this week, including Powell and the Fed's newest member, Stephen Miran. Economists on Thursday will get the final revision to second-quarter GDP, which was revised higher in August. Data for both new and pending home sales in August comes amid a decline in mortgage rates in recent weeks. Data on consumer sentiment, jobless claims, and durable-goods orders are also on tap. On the corporate calendar, Micron Technology is scheduled to report results on Tuesday. The chipmaker in June reported record quarterly revenue amid booming demand for its memory chips from data center clients. Analysts are generally bullish on Micron stock, which hit a record high last week. Costco is set to report its quarterly results on Thursday. In May, the bulk retailer reported sales rose by 8% amid continued growth in same-store sales. Recent retail sales data suggested that consumers are still spending. CarMax’s earnings on the same day will provide insight into the state of the used-car market. Auto parts seller AutoZone, business services provider Cintas, and advisory firm Accenture will also report this week. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Latest Markets News Monday, Sept. 22 Tuesday, Sept. 23 Wednesday, Sept. 24 Thursday, Sept. 25 Friday, Sept. 26 The Federal Reserve has come through with its much-anticipated interest rate cut. But what are the implications for your savings account? Investopedia’s Sabrina Karl explains what the rate cut means for savers here.

Title: There's a New Way to Play Quarterly Earnings With Polymarket's Latest Rollout

There's a new way to make a buck on companies' earnings reports—and in some ways, this one may be the most straightforward. Predictions marketplace Polymarket last week rolled out a new category of contracts that lets users put money on whether or not a company will beat Wall Street's expectations. It's a departure from what could be considered the traditional methods involving stocks and derivatives, but it's also a simplified way for people to profit from publicly-traded companies' bottom lines. A handful of well-known companies, including Micron Tech (MU), CarMax (KMX), and Costco (COST), are due to report in the coming weeks, and Polymarket has contracts for all of them. Here's how the new offering will work: Users can bet on the question of whether Costco will beat its quarterly estimate for earnings per share. At recent prices, a "yes" bet costs 79 cents and a "no" is 22 cents, indicating that the latter is seen as less likely. That means a winning $100 wager could result in a net profit of $21 on a beat, or $78 on a miss. Bloomberg's consensus estimates are used to determine wins and losses; if earnings aren't reported as scheduled, and don't land within 45 days, the contract is resolved as a "no." (If the earnings match estimates, it's a loss.) A wrong bet leaves you with nothing. There are, of course, other ways to go about this. One could trade a company's stock—long or short—or associated call and put options ahead of earnings reports, but those aren't so much direct bets on the results as tied to price movements that could be driven by the company's forward guidance, how optimistic or pessimistic management sounded during its earnings call, the earnings themselves, or other factors. When buying the stock, of course, you also own an asset that, broadly speaking, can be held as long as desired. Other prediction markets, like Kalshi, offer contracts on what might be mentioned on a company's earnings call, but not one specifically for earnings beats. Polymarket's new contracts are part of a broader trend marrying moneyed matters with social media. The prediction market platform launched the earnings report bets as they partnered with StockTwits, where users of the finance-focused social media platform will be able to view the probabilities of market-moving events on Polymarket directly in its app. Polymarket contracts aren't yet available in the U.S., though that seems to be moving closer to reality. The company is in the middle of a comeback in the U.S. after the the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission and Justice Department ended a probe into the company without filing charges. Polymarket did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment on the timing of its U.S. launch in time for publication. "Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the @CFTC. Credit to the Commission and Staff for their impressive work. This process has been accomplished in record timing," Shayne Coplan, chief of Polymarket, said on social media in reference to the regulator's no-action letter on events contracts earlier this month.

Title: Stocks Over Spot: The Case For Buying Bitcoin Treasury Companies Instead Of BTC
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/the-case-for-buying-bitcoin-treasury/
Time Published: 2025-09-21T00:00:34Z

Bitcoin is among the world’s most important assets, but owning it directly is not the only way to get exposure. A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk, allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset. Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.

I value my family, friends, career, and time. Really, those are most likely the most significant aspects of every person's existence. Not illusions, but dreams are what I pursue.
